74091597,Stroke-based sorting,"characters are ordered by different features of strokes, including stroke counts, stroke forms, stroke orders, stroke combinations, stroke positions, etc.
Stroke-count sorting.
This method arranges characters according to their numbers of strokes ascendingly. A character with less strokes is put before those of more strokes. For example, the different characters in ""漢字筆劃, 汉字笔画 "" (Chinese character strokes) are sorted into ""汉(5)字(6)画(8)笔(10)[筆(12)畫(12)]漢(14)"", where stroke counts are put in brackets. (Please note that both 筆 and 畫 are of 12 strokes and their order is not determinable by stroke-count sorting.).
Stroke-count sorting was first used in Zihui to arrange the radicals and the characters under each radical when the dictionary was published in 1615 
It was also used in Kangxi Chinese Character Dictionary when the dictionary was first compiled in 1710s.
