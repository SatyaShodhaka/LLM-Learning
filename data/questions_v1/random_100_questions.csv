Stroke-count sorting.
This method arranges characters according to their numbers of strokes ascendingly. A character with less strokes is put before those of more strokes. For example, the different characters in ""漢字筆劃, 汉字笔画 "" (Chinese character strokes) are sorted into ""汉(5)字(6)画(8)笔(10)[筆(12)畫(12)]漢(14)"", where stroke counts are put in brackets. (Please note that both 筆 and 畫 are of 12 strokes and their order is not determinable by stroke-count sorting.).
Stroke-count sorting was first used in Zihui to arrange the radicals and the characters under each radical when the dictionary was published in 1615 
It was also used in Kangxi Chinese Character Dictionary when the dictionary was first compiled in 1710s.

There was speculation that the city administration might resign as a sign of protest.

Only one small demonstration occurred on the evening of the 28th, which was broken up by the National Guard without incident.
