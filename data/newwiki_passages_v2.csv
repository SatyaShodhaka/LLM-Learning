72977646,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72977646,Mode conversion,"Mode conversion is the transformation of a wave at an interface into other wave types (modes).
Principle.
Mode conversion occurs when a wave encounters an interface between materials of different impedances and the incident angle is not normal to the interface. Thus, for example, if a longitudinal wave from a fluid (e.g., water or air) strikes a solid (e.g., steel plate), it is usually refracted and reflected as a function of the angle of incidence, but if some of the energy causes particle movement in the transverse direction, a second transverse wave is generated, which can also be refracted and reflected. Snellius' law of refraction can be formulated as:

This means that the incident wave is split into two different wave types at the interface. If we consider a wave incident",258931
