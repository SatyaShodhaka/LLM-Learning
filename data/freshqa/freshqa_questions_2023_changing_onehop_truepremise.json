        "context": "\nA food allergy is an abnormal immune response to food. The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as anaphylaxis.[1] A food intolerance and food poisoning are separate conditions, not due to an immune response.[1][4]\nEarly exposure to potential allergens may be protective.[2][3] Management primarily involves avoiding the food in question and having a plan if exposure occurs.[2] This plan may include giving adrenaline (epinephrine) and wearing medical alert jewelry.[1] The benefits of allergen immunotherapy for food allergies is unclear, thus is not recommended as of 2015[update].[7] Some types of food allergies among children resolve with age, including those to milk, eggs, and soy; while others such as to nuts and shellfish typically do not.[2]\nIn the developed world, about 4% to 8% of people have at least one food allergy.[1][2] They are more common in children than adults and appear to be increasing in frequency.[2] Male children appear to be more commonly affected than females.[2] Some allergies more commonly develop early in life, while others typically develop in later life.[1] In developed countries, more people believe they have food allergies when they actually do not have them.[8][9][10]\nIn some cases, however, onset of symptoms may be delayed for hours.[11]\nSymptoms can vary. The amount of food needed to trigger a reaction also varies.[12]\nSerious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated through wheezing and cyanosis. Poor blood circulation leads to a weak pulse, pale skin and fainting.[13]\nA severe case of an allergic reaction, caused by symptoms affecting the respiratory tract and blood circulation, is called anaphylaxis. When symptoms are related to a drop in blood pressure, the person is said to be in anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show symptoms.[14] Those with asthma or an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or seafood are at greater risk for anaphylaxis.\nAllergic reactions are abnormal immune responses that develop after exposure to a given food allergen.[15] Food allergens account for about 90% of all allergic reactions.[16] The most common food allergens include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat,[17] which are referred to as \"the big eight\".[18] In April of 2021, President Joe Biden signed the FASTER Act into law. This landmark food allergy law recognizes sesame as the ninth mandatory food label allergen. It also encourages research that will improve the quality of life for food allergy families, and that could potentially lower the rates of future food allergies.[19][20]\nPeanuts, a member of the legume family, are one of the most common food allergens that induce reactions in both children and adults.[21] Affecting about 2% of the Western population, peanut allergies tend to cause more severe reactions and anaphylaxis than other food allergies.[22] Tree nuts, including almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts, are also common allergens. Affected individuals may be sensitive to one particular tree nut or many different ones.[23] Peanuts and seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, can be processed to extract oils, but trace amounts of protein may also elicit an allergic reaction.[23] Peanut and tree nut allergies are lifelong conditions for the majority of those affected, although evidence shows that ~20% of those with peanut allergies and 9% of those with tree nut allergies may outgrow them.[24]\nEgg allergies affect about one in 50 children but are frequently outgrown when children reach age five.[25] Affected individuals can be sensitive to proteins both in the egg white and egg yolk, but most children are allergic to those in the white while most adults are allergic to those in the yolk.[26]\nCow's milk is the most common food allergen in infants and young children, yet many adults are also sensitized to cow's milk.[27] Many affected individuals cannot tolerate dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.[28] A small portion of children with milk allergy, roughly 10%, have a reaction to beef because it contains small amounts of protein that are also present in cow's milk.[29]\nShellfish, which are divided into crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and mollusks (mussel, oyster, scallop, squid, octopus, snail, etc.), are the most common food allergy in adults.[30] People may be allergic to other types of seafood, such as fish.[31] Fish allergies were found to be more common in countries that have high fish consumption compared to those with lower consumption.[32]\nOther common food allergens include soy and wheat.[33] Those allergic to wheat may be sensitized to any protein in the wheat kernel.[34] To a lesser frequency, people may be mildly allergic to raw fruits and vegetables, a disease known as oral allergy syndrome.[33] Less common allergens include maize, spices, synthetic and natural colors,[35] and chemical additives.[36]\nBalsam of Peru, which is in various foods, is in the \"top five\" allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics.[37]\nExposure to certain food proteins triggers the production of antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which, if unaccompanied by allergic symptoms, is known as allergic sensitization.[38] Oral ingestion is the main sensitization route for most food allergy cases, yet other routes of exposure include inhalation and skin contact.[39][34]\nFor example, inhaling airborne particles in a farm-scale or factory-scale peanut shelling/crushing environment, or from cooking, can induce respiratory effects in allergic individuals.[40] Furthermore, peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants,[41] suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization.[42][43] An estimated 28.5 million people worldwide are engaged in the seafood industry, which includes fishing, aquaculture, processing and industrial cooking.[44] In these occupational settings, individuals with fish and shellfish allergies are at high risk of exposure to allergenic proteins via aerosolization.[45][44] Respiratory symptoms may be induced by inhalation of wet aerosols from fresh fish handling, inhalation of dry aerosols from fishmeal processing, and dermal contact through skin breaks and cuts.[46][44] Another occupational food allergy that involves respiratory symptoms is \"baker's asthma,\" which commonly develops in food service workers who work with baked goods.[47] Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat, some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens.[48]\nAllergic sensitization can occur via skin antigen exposure, which usually manifests as hives.[49] The skin has been suggested to be a critical sensitization route for peanut-allergic individuals.[50][40] Peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants,[41] reinforcing that those with disrupted epithelial barriers, notably the skin barrier, are more prone to skin sensitization.[42] Environmental factors, such as exposure to food, microorganisms, creams, and detergents, may lead to skin barrier dysfunction.[51] Several studies reveal that children exposed to skin creams containing peanut oil are reported to have a higher risk of peanut allergy,[51] suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization.[42][43]\nSome children who are allergic to cow's milk protein also show a cross-sensitivity to soy-based products.[53] Some infant formulas have their milk and soy proteins hydrolyzed, so when taken by infants, their immune systems do not recognize the allergen and they can safely consume the product. Hypoallergenic infant formulas can be based on proteins partially predigested to a less antigenic form. Other formulas, based on free amino acids, are the least antigenic and provide complete nutritional support in severe forms of milk allergy. [54]\nHistamine, the structure shown, causes a person to feel itchy during an allergic reaction.\nConditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response:[57]\nIgE-mediated (classic) \u2013 the most common type, occurs shortly after eating and may involve anaphylaxis.\nNon-IgE mediated \u2013 characterized by an immune response not involving immunoglobulin E; may occur some hours after eating, complicating diagnosis\nIgE and/or non-IgE-mediated \u2013 a hybrid of the above two types\nAllergic reactions are abnormal immune responses to certain substances that are normally harmless. When immune cells encounter the allergenic protein, IgE antibodies are produced; this is similar to the immune system's reaction to foreign pathogens. The IgE antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction. The harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein. IgE antibodies bind to a receptor on the surface of the protein, creating a tag, just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged. Why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do is not entirely clear.[58]\nHypersensitivities are categorized according to the parts of the immune system that are attacked and the amount of time it takes for the response to occur. The four types of hypersensitivity reaction are: type 1, immediate IgE-mediated; type 2, cytotoxic; type 3, immune complex-mediated; and type 4, delayed cell-mediated.[59] The pathophysiology of allergic responses can be divided into two phases. The first is an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen. This phase can either subside or progress into a \"late-phase reaction\" which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in tissue damage.[citation needed]\nMany food allergies are caused by hypersensitivities to particular proteins in different foods. Proteins have unique properties that allow them to become allergens, such as stabilizing forces in their tertiary and quaternary structures which prevent degradation during digestion. Many theoretically allergenic proteins cannot survive the destructive environment of the digestive tract, thus do not trigger hypersensitive reactions.[60]\nIn the early stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen, encountered for the first time, causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, which belongs to a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is the production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called Fc\u03b5RI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.[61]\nIf later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth-muscle contraction. This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, the allergen, and the mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems.[61]\nAfter the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2\u201324 hours after the original reaction.[62] Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects.[63]\nFor skin-prick tests, a tiny board with protruding needles is used. The allergens are placed either on the board or directly on the skin. The board is then placed on the skin, to puncture the skin and for the allergens to enter the body. If a hive appears, the person is considered positive for the allergy. This test only works for IgE antibodies. Allergic reactions caused by other antibodies cannot be detected through skin-prick tests.[64]\nSkin-prick testing is easy to do and results are available in minutes. Different allergists may use different devices for testing. Some use a \"bifurcated needle\", which looks like a fork with two prongs. Others use a \"multitest\", which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it. In these tests, a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a testing device, and the device is placed on the skin to prick, or break through, the top layer of skin. This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin. A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic. This test generally yields a positive or negative result. It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not because it detects IgE. Skin tests cannot predict if a reaction would occur or what kind of reaction might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen. They can, however, confirm an allergy in light of a patient's history of reactions to a particular food. Non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.\nPatch testing is used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed food reactions.[65][66][67]\nBlood testing is another way to test for allergies; however, it poses the same disadvantage and only detects IgE allergens and does not work for every possible allergen. Radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) is used to detect IgE antibodies present to a certain allergen. The score taken from the RAST is compared to predictive values, taken from a specific type of RAST. If the score is higher than the predictive values, a great chance the allergy is present in the person exists. One advantage of this test is that it can test many allergens at one time.[68]\nA CAP-RAST has greater specificity than RAST; it can show the amount of IgE present to each allergen.[69] Researchers have been able to determine \"predictive values\" for certain foods, which can be compared to the RAST results. If a person's RAST score is higher than the predictive value for that food, over a 95% chance exists that patients will have an allergic reaction (limited to rash and anaphylaxis reactions) if they ingest that food.[citation needed] Currently,[when?] predictive values are available for milk, egg, peanut, fish, soy, and wheat.[70][71][72] Blood tests allow for hundreds of allergens to be screened from a single sample, and cover food allergies as well as inhalants. However, non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method. Other widely promoted tests such as the antigen leukocyte cellular antibody test and the food allergy profile are considered unproven methods, the use of which is not advised.[73]\nFood challenges test for allergens other than those caused by IgE allergens. The allergen is given to the person in the form of a pill, so the person can ingest the allergen directly. The person is watched for signs and symptoms. The problem with food challenges is that they must be performed in the hospital under careful watch, due to the possibility of anaphylaxis.[74]\nFood challenges, especially double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, are the gold standard for diagnosis of food allergies, including most non-IgE-mediated reactions, but is rarely done.[75] Blind food challenges involve packaging the suspected allergen into a capsule, giving it to the patient, and observing the patient for signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.[medical citation needed]\nThe recommended method for diagnosing food allergy is to be assessed by an allergist. The allergist will review the patient's history and the symptoms or reactions that have been noted after food ingestion. If the allergist feels the symptoms or reactions are consistent with food allergy, he/she will perform allergy tests. Additional diagnostic tools for evaluation of eosinophilic or non-IgE mediated reactions include endoscopy, colonoscopy, and biopsy.[medical citation needed]\nLactose intolerance generally develops later in life, but can present in young patients in severe cases. It is not an immune reaction and is due to an enzyme deficiency (lactase). It is more common in many non-Western people.\nBreastfeeding for more than four months may prevent atopic dermatitis, cow's milk allergy, and wheezing in early childhood.[79] Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective.[2] Specifically, early exposure to eggs and peanuts reduces the risk of allergies to these.[3] Guidelines suggest introducing peanuts as early as 4\u20136 months and include precautionary measures for high-risk infants.[80] The former guidelines, advising delaying the introduction of peanuts, are now[when?] thought to have contributed to the increase in peanut allergy seen recently.[81][better source needed]\nTo avoid an allergic reaction, a strict diet can be followed. It is difficult to determine the amount of allergenic food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted. In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens through skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, blood transfusions, cosmetics, and alcohol.[82]\nEarly introduction of peanut and egg alongside other solids, or by one year of age, may help prevent development of food allergy. Introduction of these allergenic foods within the first year of life appears to be safe. A window of opportunity for the introduction of different food allergens may exist, such as egg introduction ahead of peanut.[83]\nAllergic reactions to airborne particles or vapors of known food allergens have been reported as an occupational consequence of people working in the food industry, but can also take place in home situations, restaurants, or confined spaces such as airplanes. According to two reviews, respiratory symptoms are common, but in some cases there has been progression to anaphylaxis.[84][85] The most frequent reported cases of reactions by inhalation of allergenic foods were due to peanut, seafood, legumes, tree nut, and cow's milk.[84] Steam rising from cooking of lentils, green beans, chickpeas and fish has been well documented as triggering reactions, including anaphylactic reactions.[84][86] One review mentioned case study examples of allergic responses to inhalation of other foods, including examples in which oral consumption of the food is tolerated.[84]\nThe mainstay of treatment for food allergy is total avoidance of the foods identified as allergens. An allergen can enter the body by consuming a portion of food containing the allergen, and can also be ingested by touching any surfaces that may have come into contact with the allergen, then touching the eyes or nose. For people who are extremely sensitive, avoidance includes avoiding touching or inhaling problematic food. Total avoidance is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see regulation of labelling).\nIf the food is accidentally ingested and a systemic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs, then epinephrine should be used. A second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions. The person should then be transported to the emergency room, where additional treatment can be given. Other treatments include antihistamines and steroids.[87]\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). If administered in a timely manner, epinephrine can reverse its effects. Epinephrine relieves airway swelling and obstruction, and improves blood circulation; blood vessels are tightened and heart rate is increased, improving circulation to body organs. Epinephrine is available by prescription in an autoinjector.[88]\nAntihistamines can alleviate some of the milder symptoms of an allergic reaction, but do not treat all symptoms of anaphylaxis.[89] Antihistamines block the action of histamine, which causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky to plasma proteins. Histamine also causes itchiness by acting on sensory nerve terminals. The most common antihistamine given for food allergies is diphenhydramine.\nGlucocorticoid steroids are used to calm down the immune system cells that are attacked by the chemicals released during an allergic reaction. This treatment in the form of a nasal spray should not be used to treat anaphylaxis, for it only relieves symptoms in the area in which the steroid is in contact. Another reason steroids should not be used is the delay in reducing inflammation. Steroids can also be taken orally or through injection, by which every part of the body can be reached and treated, but a long time is usually needed for these to take effect.[90]\nFood allergies affect up to 10% of the worldwide population, and they are currently more prevalent in children (~8%) than adults (~5) in western nations.[34] In several industrialized countries, food allergies affect up to 10% of children.[91] Children are most commonly allergic to cow's milk, chicken eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts.[21] While studies on adults with food allergy are not as abundant, surveys suggest that the most common food allergens for adults include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts.[91]\nFood allergies have become increasingly prevalent in industrialized/westernized nations over the last 2-3 decades.[92] An estimated 15 million people currently have food allergies in the United States.[93] In 1997, 0.4% children in the United States were reported to have peanut allergy, yet this number markedly rose to 1.4% in 2008.[94] In Australia, hospital admission rates for food-induced anaphylaxis increased by an average of 13.2% from 1994-2005.[91] One possible explanation for the rise in food allergy is the \"old friends\" hypothesis, which suggests that non disease causing organisms, such as helminths, could protect against allergy. Therefore, reduced exposure to these organisms, particularly in developed countries, could have contributed towards the increase.[citation needed]\nChildren of East Asian or African descent who live in westernized countries were reported to be at significantly higher risk of food allergy compared to Caucasian children.[15] Several studies predict that Asia and Africa may experience a growth in food allergy prevalence as the lifestyles there become more westernized.[91]\nThe prevalence of certain food allergies is suggested to depend partly on the geographical area and country. For instance, allergy to buckwheat flour, used for soba noodles, is more common in Japan than peanuts, tree nuts or foods made from soy beans.[95] Also, shellfish allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in adults and adolescents particularly in East Asian countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand.[91] Individuals in East Asia have further developed an allergy to rice, which forms a large part of their diet.[96] Another example is that, out of 9 European countries, egg allergy was found[by whom?] to be most prevalent in the UK and least prevalent in Greece.[citation needed]\nAbout 75% of children who have allergies to milk protein are able to tolerate baked-in milk products, i.e., muffins, cookies, cake, and hydrolyzed formulas.[97] About 50% of children with allergies to milk, egg, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, and wheat will outgrow their allergy by the age of 6. Those who are still allergic by the age of 12 or so have less than an 8% chance of outgrowing the allergy.[98]\nIn the United States, food allergy affects as many as 5% of infants less than three years of age[99] and 3% to 4% of adults.[100][101] The prevalence of food allergies is rising.[102][103][104] Food allergies cause roughly 30,000 emergency room visits and 150 deaths per year.[105]\nWhether rates of food allergy are increasing or not, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their caregivers.[106][107][108][109] In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. The Culinary Institute of America, a premier school for chef training, has courses in allergen-free cooking and a separate teaching kitchen.[110] School systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into the school. Despite all these precautions, people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can easily occur at other peoples' houses, at school or in restaurants.[111]\nIn response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain priority allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods.\nThere are no labeling laws mandating declaration of the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross-contamination, except in Brazil.[118][119][120][121][122][123][124][125]\nIn the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains any of these eight major food allergens, added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat.[119] The eight-ingredient is list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission.[124] To meet labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its \"food sourced name\" in parentheses, for example, \"Casein (milk),\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \"Contains milk\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling).[119][121] The European Union requires listing for those eight major allergens plus molluscs, celery, mustard, lupin, sesame and sulfites.[120]\nIn 2018, the US FDA issued a request for information for the consideration of labeling for sesame to help protect people who have sesame allergies.[126] A decision was reached in November 2020 that food manufacturers voluntarily declare that when powdered sesame seeds are used as a previously unspecified spice or flavor, the label be changed to \"spice (sesame)\" or \"flavor (sesame).\"[127]\nCongress and the President passed a law in April 2021, the \"FASTER Act\", stipulating that labeling be mandatory, to be effect January 1, 2023, making it the ninth required food ingredient label.[128]\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 applies to packaged foods regulated by the FDA, which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages.[125] However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like \"Contains: milk\", are mandatory.[122][123] The act also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants.[129][130] The EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 \u2013 requires food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, for example, in catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars.[131]\nIn the United States, there is no federal mandate to address the presence of allergens in drug products, medicines, or cosmetics.[132]\nThe value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross-contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.).[124][125] Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated.[133][134]\nLabeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling, also known as \"may contain\" statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production.[124][135] Precautionary allergen labeling can be confusing to consumers, especially as there can be many variations on the wording of the warning.[135][136] Precautionary allergen labeling is optional in the United States.[137] As of 2014[update], precautionary allergen labeling is regulated only in Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010 and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. South Africa does not permit the use of precautionary allergen labeling, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment and despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice.[124] In Australia and New Zealand there is a recommendation that precautionary allergen labeling be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling). A review identified \"the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population\" as the threshold reference dose for certain foods (such as cow's milk, egg, peanut and other proteins) to provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labeling and give consumers a better idea of what might be accidentally in a food product beyond \"may contain.\"[138][139] VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry sponsored, non-government organization.[140] The European Union has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but is not expected to publish such before 2024.[141]\nIn Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. These allergens include wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybrids, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybean, milk of all species of mammalians, almonds, hazelnuts, cashew nuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecan nuts, pistachios, pine nuts, and chestnuts.[118]\nAlthough there is a scientific consensus that available food derived from genetically modified crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food,[142][143][144] and a 2016 U.S. National Academy of Sciences report concluded that there is no relationship between consumption of genetically modified foods and the increase in prevalence of food allergies,[145] there are concerns that genetically modified foods, also described as foods sourced from genetically modified organisms, could be responsible for allergic reactions, and that the widespread acceptance of these types of foods may be responsible for what is a real or perceived increase in the percentage of people with allergies.[146][145][147]\nOne concern is that genetic engineering could make an allergy-provoking food more allergic, meaning that smaller portions would suffice to set off a reaction.[147] Of the food currently[when?] in widespread use of genetically modified organisms, only soybeans are identified as a common allergen. However, for the soybean proteins known to trigger allergic reactions, there is more variation from strain to strain than between those and the genetically modified varieties.[145] Another concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[146]\nPrior to a new genetically modified food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[145] Genes approved for animal use can be restricted from human consumption due to potential for allergic reactions. In 1998 Starlink brand corn restricted to animals was detected in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall.[148] There are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing genetically modified ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (similar to the requirements in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[146]\nIn the US, the FDA Food Code states that the person in charge in restaurants should have knowledge about major food allergens, cross-contacts, and symptoms of food allergy\nreactions. Restaurant staff, including wait staff and kitchen staff, may not be adequately informed about allergenic ingredients, or the risk of cross-contact when kitchen utensils used to prepare food may have been in previous contact with an allergenic food. The problem may be compounded when customers have a hard time describing their food allergies or when wait staff have a hard time understanding those with food allergies when taking an order.[149]\nThere exists both over-reporting and under-reporting of the prevalence of food allergies. Self-diagnosed perceptions of food allergy are greater than the rates of true food allergy because people confuse non-allergic intolerance with allergy, and also attribute non-allergy symptoms to an allergic response. Conversely, healthcare professionals treating allergic reactions on an out-patient or even hospitalized basis may not report all cases. Recent increases in reported cases may reflect a real change in incidence or an increased awareness on the part of healthcare professionals.[150]\nFood fear has a significant impact on quality of life.[108][109] For children with allergies, their quality of life is also affected by the actions of their peers. An increased occurrence of bullying has been observed, which can include threats or deliberate acts of forcing allergic children to contact foods that they must avoid or intentional contamination of allergen-free food.[151] The social impacts of food allergies can carry over into adulthood.[152]\nMedia portrayals of food allergy in television and film are not accurate, often used for comedic effect or underplaying the potential severity of an allergic reaction.[153] These tropes misinform the public and also contribute to how entertainment media will continue to wrongly portray food allergies in the future. Types of tropes: 1) characters have food allergies, providing a weakness that can be used to sabotage them. In the movie Parasite a housekeeper is displaced by taking advantage of her peach allergy.[154] In the animated film Peter Rabbit, the farm owner is attacked by being pelted with blackberries, causing an anaphylactic reaction requiring emergency treatment with epinephrine. After many public protests, Sony Pictures and the Peter Rabbit director apologized for making light of food allergies.[155] 2) Food allergy is used for comedic effect, such as in the movies Hitch and in television, Kelso's egg allergy in That '70s Show 3) Food allergies may be incorporated into characters who are also portrayed as annoying, weak and oversensitive, which can be taken as implying that their allergies are either not real or not potentially severe. In season 1, episode 16 of The Big Bang Theory Howard Wolowitz deliberately consumes a peanut-containing food bar (and has a serious reaction) just to delay Leonard from returning to his apartment where a surprise birthday party is being arranged. 4) Any of these portrayals may underplay the potential severity of food allergy, some showing that Benadryl treatment is sufficient.[154] Viewing of humorous portrayals of food allergies has been shown to have a negative effect on related health policy support due to low perceived seriousness.[153]\nSeveral theories have been suggested to explain why certain individuals develop allergic sensitization instead of oral tolerance to food allergens. One such theory is the dual allergen hypothesis, which states that ingesting food allergens early on promotes oral tolerance while skin exposure leads to sensitization.[93] Instead of oral ingestion, skin barrier disruption in conditions like eczema, for instance, was suggested to cause allergic sensitization in animal and human infants.[49] Inhalation was recently proposed to be an additional sensitization route in the dual allergen hypothesis.[43] Another theory is the barrier regulation hypothesis, describing the role of commensal bacteria in preventing the development of food allergy by maintaining integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier.[93] Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as early life nutrition and antibiotic treatment, may contribute to food allergy prevalence by affecting gut microbial composition, and thus, intestinal immune homeostasis in infants and young children.[156]\nThere is research on the effects of increasing intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy, lactation, via infant formula and in early childhood on the subsequent risk of developing food allergies during infancy and childhood. From two reviews, maternal intake of omega-3, long-chain fatty acids during pregnancy appeared to reduce the risks of medically diagnosed IgE-mediated allergy, eczema and food allergy per parental reporting in the first 12 months of life,[158][159] but the effects were not all sustained past 12 months.[159] The reviews characterized the literature's evidence as inconsistent and limited.[158][159] Results when breastfeeding mothers were consuming a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids were inconclusive.[160] For infants, supplementing their diet with oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids did not affect the risks of food allergies, eczema or asthma either as infants or into childhood.[161]\nThere is research on probiotics, prebiotics and the combination of the two (synbiotics) as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies. From reviews, there appears to be a treatment benefit for eczema,[162][163][164] but not asthma, wheezing or rhinoconjunctivitis.[165] The evidence was not consistent for preventing food allergies and this approach cannot yet be recommended.[163][164][166][167]\nThe Food Standards Agency, in the United Kingdom, are in charge of funding research into food allergies and intolerance.[150] Since their founding in 1994 they have funded over 45 studies.[150] In 2005 Europe created EuroPrevall, a multi-country project dedicated to research involving allergies.[150]",

        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Corp.#:~:text=Linda%20Yaccarino%20(CEO)",
        "context": "\nX Corp. is an American technology company established by Elon Musk in 2023 as the successor to Twitter, Inc. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings Corp., which is itself owned by Musk. The company owns the social networking service X (formerly Twitter) and has announced plans to use it as a base for other offerings.[4][5]\nIn April 2022, filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed Musk had formed three corporate entities in Delaware, all under the name of X Holdings. According to the filings, one of the entities was to merge with Twitter, Inc., while another was to serve as the parent company of the newly merged company. A third entity would then help take on a US$13 billion loan provided by various large banks to acquire Twitter.[6]\nThe name \"X\" dates back to X.com, an online bank co-founded by Musk in 1999. In March 2000, X.com merged with competitor Confinity to create PayPal.[7] Musk considered forming a holding company named \"X\" for Tesla, Inc. and SpaceX in August 2012.[8] In July 2017, Musk reacquired the domain X.com, for an undisclosed amount, from PayPal.[9] Musk reaffirmed his support for the name \"X\" in December 2020, replying to a Twitter user who renewed calls for Musk to form a new holding company under that name, although he dismissed the idea of X acquiring his businesses.[10]\nThe concept for X solidified in October 2022, when Musk tweeted that acquiring Twitter is \"an accelerant to creating X, the everything app\". According to Musk, Twitter would accelerate the creation of X by \"3 to 5 years\". Musk expressed interest in creating an app similar to WeChat\u2014a Chinese instant messaging, social media, and mobile payment app\u2014on a podcast in May 2022.[11] In June, Musk told Twitter employees that Twitter is a \"digital town square\" that should be all-encompassing, like WeChat.[12] In a Morgan Stanley conference in March 2023, Musk touted X once again as the potentially \"biggest financial institution in the world\".[13] On October 27, 2022, Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, and subsequently became its CEO.[14]\nIn March 2023, Musk registered X Corp. in Nevada. On the same day, Musk registered the artificial intelligence (AI) company X.AI.[15] Later that month, Musk applied to merge X Holdings I with X Holdings Corp. and Twitter, Inc. with X Corp.[6] In the filing, Musk revealed that X Holdings Corp. had $2 million in capital, but X Holdings Corp. would serve as the parent company for X Corp.[16] In a company-wide email that month, Musk announced that Twitter employees would receive stock in X Corp.[17]\nOn May 11, 2023, Musk tweeted that he had found his replacement as Twitter and X Corp.'s CEO. The next day, on May 12, he named Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO, adding that she \"will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology\".[19] Musk said he would transition his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[20] Yaccarino succeeded Musk on June 5, 2023.[21]\nAt the end of May 2023, Fidelity Investments estimated the company's value at $15 billion.[22] This was later increased to a value of $27 billion by July,[23][24] and up to about $28.5 billion by the end of August.[25][26]\nThe company erected a giant illuminated \"X\" on the roof of its San Francisco headquarters in July 2023 without obtaining required permits. 24 complaints were filed by neighbors concerned about the bright flashing light and structural integrity. Inspectors were twice denied roof access, and the city cited the company for a building code violation. X removed the sign after a few days.[27][28]\nIn August 2023, CEO Linda Yaccarino stated that she has \"operational autonomy\" under owner Elon Musk to run the business, and that she's involved in everything that goes into running the company.[29][30] Yaccarino also opened up on the reasoning behind Twitter's \"controversial\" name change to X,[31] wherein she stated that the rebranding was essentially a \"liberation\" from Twitter. Yaccarino also went on to say that if users had stayed with Twitter, then changes would only be \"incremental\" and that with X, they think about \"what's possible\".[32]\nIn October 2023, the marketing agency X Social Media filed a lawsuit against X Corp alleging a violation its trademark of the letter X.[33]\nIn response, X Corp. mentioned that the platform encouraged diversity and free speech, stating that \"more than 99.99% of post impressions are healthy\" in a blog post.[36] The post further mentioned that the CCDH was spreading \"false and misleading claims\", which would incur financial downfall as it encouraged advertisers to halt investment on X.[37] The blog also further described the CCDH as a \"scare campaign\" working continuously to prevent \"public dialogue\", alleging that the CCDH's research utilized metrics that were purposely put \"out of context to make unsubstantiated assertions about X\".[38] X then filed a legal claim against CCDH and the European Climate Foundation, which it alleged was providing the information used in CCDH's research, and that X denied all claims stated by the CCDH.[39][40]",

        "context": "\nIn October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink\u2014a neurotechnology company developing brain\u2013computer interfaces\u2014and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.[7]\nMusk's family was wealthy during his youth.[21] His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[11] His maternal grandfather and namesake, Joshua Elon Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[23][24][25][26] Haldeman was a member of the Social Credit Party of Canada, possessed antisemitic beliefs, and supported the Technocracy movement.[27] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.[13][18] Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[28] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[23][29]\nIn 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2.[57][58] Errol Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding.[59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61] with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[51] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[62] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[63]Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[64][65] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[66]\nLater in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[67] X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[68] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[69]\nIn 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[61][69][70] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[71] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[72] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[73][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[75][76]\nIn 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk\u2014PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares\u2014received $175.8 million.[77][78] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[79][80] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[81]\nIn early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[82] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[83] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[83] With $100 million of his own money,[84] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[85][86]\nIn 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[101] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[102] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[103][c] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[106][107][108]\nTesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[116] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[117] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design,but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[118]\nFollowing a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[119][page needed][120] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[121] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[122][123] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[124] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[125]\nMusk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting\nTesla began delivery of an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[126] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[127] A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[128] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[129] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[130][131] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[132] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[133] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[134]\nSince its initial public offering in 2010,[135] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[136][137] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[138][139] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[140] In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[141] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[141] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[142] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.[143] In 2022, Musk unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.[144] On June 20, 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime MinisterNarendra Modi in New York City, suggesting that he might be interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[145]\nIn 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[146][d] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[146][150][151] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[152] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[153][154] In April 2022, the shareholder who sued Musk over the tweet, along with several Tesla shareholders, said that a federal judge had ruled that the tweet was false, although the ruling in question has not been unsealed.[155] In February 2023, the jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[156]\nIn 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[157] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet; the accusation was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[158] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[159] In 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[160][161]FOIA-released records showed that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[162]\nMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[163] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[164] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[165] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[166][167]\nTesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[168] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[169][170] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[171][172] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[173]\nIn 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[174] He is listed as the sole author of an October 2019 paper that details some of Neuralink's research,[178] although Musk's being listed as such rankled the Neuralink team's researchers.[179] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[180][181][182] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[180] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[177] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[183]\nIn 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[187][188] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[189] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[190]\nTwo tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[191][192] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[193] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[194] In 2021, tunnel construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[195]\nMusk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[197] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[198][199] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[200] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[201] making him the largest shareholder.[202][e] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 IPO.[204] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[205][206] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[202][207] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[208] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[209] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[210][211]\nTesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[212][213] He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[214] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[215] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[216] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[217] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[218] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[219] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[220]\nIn late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that majority of user wanted him to do so.[234][235] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[236]\nMusk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012\nMusk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[237]The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[238] Musk does not make formal business plans;[238] instead, he says he prefers to approach engineering problems[non sequitur] with an \"iterative design methodology\" and \"tolerance for failures\".[239] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[240] vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla's software.[237]\nMusk's handling of employees\u2014whom he communicates with directly through mass emails\u2014has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[241][242][243] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes for 80 hours per week.[244] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[245][246] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[246] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[247] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[248]\nMusk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[237] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[243][249] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[250]The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[251]\nMusk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[252][253] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[254]\nAs of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's non-profit Big Green.[255] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to non-profit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[256] which was a non-profit at the time.[257]\nVox said \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[256] The foundation has been criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated.[260] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[255] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[261] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160million to non-profits that year.[262]\nIn August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain\u2014a vacuum tube train\u2014and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[263] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the hyperloop.[264] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[265] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[266] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[267]\nIn 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015\u20132017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[268] In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[269] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from the Boring Company website in 2021.[270] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is cited to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[271]\nBiographer Ashlee Vance has noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[272]\nIn December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[273] A particular focus of the company is to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[28] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[274] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[275]\nIn 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as the latter company increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[276] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as GPT-3 (producing human-like text),[277] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[278]\nOn July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company has reportedly hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[279] The company, which is incorporated in Nevada, purchased 10,000 graphics processing units. Musk was reportedly obtaining funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[280]\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[281]Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, urged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[282] Engineers at SpaceX and the Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[283][284] By this time, however, eight of the 12 children, had already been rescued, the rescuers employing full face masks, oxygen, and anesthesia; consequently, Thai authorities declined to use the submarine.[281] In March 2019, Musk was later one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[285]\nSoon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[286] He deleted the tweets,[286] and apologized,[287] and he deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[288] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[289][290]\nIn September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in the District Court for the Central District of California.[291][292] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[36] The defamation case began in December 2019, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.[293] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. On December 6, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[294][295]\nIn September 2018, Musk was interviewed on an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he sampled a cigar laced with cannabis. [296] In 2022, Musk said that he and other Space-X employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[297] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[298]\nIn April 2019, Musk, through Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[299] The track, which refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event, was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.[300] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[301] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[302]TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[301]\nIn 2003, Musk said his favorite plane he owned was an L-39 Albatros.[303] He uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[304][305] His heavy use of the jet\u2014it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018\u2014and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[304][306]\nHis flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. The Twitter version of the account was blocked in December 2022, after Musk claimed that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed.[307][308][309] This led to Musk banning the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[310] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[311] The police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[312] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[313]\nMusk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[314] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[315]\nAt the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.[316] By the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.[317] During this period, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion on September 8, the largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index's history at the time.[318] In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.[319]\nIn January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.[320] Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.[321] On September 27, 2021, after Tesla stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world.[322] In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300 billion.[323]\nOn December 30, 2022, it was reported that Musk had lost $200 billion from his net worth due to declining stock values in Tesla, becoming the first person in history to lose such a large sum of money.[324][325] In January 2023, Musk was recognized by Guinness World Records for experiencing the \"largest loss of personal fortune in history\" with regards to his financial losses since November 2021, which Guinness quoted a Forbes estimate of $182 billion.[326]\nAround 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020,[319] a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022,[f] after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021.[328] Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.[317] The deal stipulated that Musk only received the compensation if Tesla reached certain market values.[329] It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.[330] In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.[330][329]\nMusk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.[331] According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.[332] He claimed his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.[331]\nSince joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[336] Musk has been an active user and has over 100 million followers as of June 2022[update].[337] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[338] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[339][340] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[341]The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[342] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[343] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[344][345] The Israel government and several media outlets accused Musk of antisemitism due to him spreading George Soros conspiracy theories,[346] although some Israeli officials defended Musk.[347]\nWhile often described as libertarian, Musk has called himself \"politically moderate\" and was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. The New York Times wrote that Musk \"expresses views that don't fit neatly into [the American] binary, left-right political framework\".[370] Historically, Musk has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[371] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest.[370] Beginning in the late 2010s, Musk's political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[372]\nIn March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[414][415] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[411] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[412]Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[416] Musk also claimed falsely that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[417][418]\nIn March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[425] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[426] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[425] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[427][428]\nIn September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[429][430] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[431] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen,\" which then trended on Twitter.[431][432] In December 2021, Musk revealed that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[433]\nMusk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[443][444]Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[445] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[446][447]\nIn December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[448] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[449]\nMusk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[450] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[451] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[452] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[453] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[454][455]\nDespite the Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[456][457][458] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[457][459][458]\nMusk has 10 surviving children.[467] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[468] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[469] After his death, the couple used IVF to continue their family;[470] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[470] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody.[471][472] In 2022, one of the twins (his eldest) officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity as a trans woman and to use Wilson as her last name because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[473] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists.\"[474]\nIn 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[475] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[476][477] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[478] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[478] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[479] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[480] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[481]\nIn 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating.[482] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[483][484] According to Musk and Grimes, his name was \"X \u00c6 A-12\" (/\u025bks\u00e6\u0283e\u026a\u02c8tw\u025blv/); however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[485][486] and was then changed to \"X \u00c6 A-Xii\". This drew more confusion, as \u00c6 is not a letter in the modern English alphabet.[487] The child was eventually named X AE A-XII Musk, with \"X\" as a first name, \"AE A-XII\" as a middle name, and \"Musk\" as surname.[488] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l Musk (nicknamed \"Y\"), born via surrogacy.[2] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[489][490] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[2] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[491] In September 2023 it was revealed that the pair had a third child, a son named Techno Mechanicus \"Tau\" Musk.[4]\nIn July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[492] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[493] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[494] Musk denied the report.[495]\nMusk has also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \u201can occasional girlfriend.\u201d[496]\nIn May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[497] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[498][499] After the release of the Business Insider article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[500] decreasing Musk's net worth by $10 billion.[501]Barron's wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk \u2013 the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[502]\nIn April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[503] In May, a judge granted the U.S. Virgin Islands' request to serve Musk electronically through Tesla after the U.S. territory had difficulty locating him.[503] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[503]\nMusk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[504][505]\nBen Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[506][507][508] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[506] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[506][507]\nIn October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he was refusing to testify in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[509][510][511] According to the lawsuit, Musk testified twice in 2022 but refused to testify a third time in 2023, claiming the SEC was harassing him.[509][511]\nThough his ventures were influential within their own industries in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[512]\n^Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[147] Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[148][149]\n^He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of U.S. securities laws.[203]\n^According to the Wall Street Journal, he was worth $140 billion, with $52 billion of that attributable to his ownership of Tesla stock.\n^ abSzalai, Jennifer (September 9, 2023). \"Elon Musk Wants to Save Humanity.

        "context": "\nThe first season of The Mandalorian premiered with the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019. A second season premiered on October 30, 2020, and a third season premiered on March 1, 2023. A fourth season is in development. Interconnected spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew expand on The Mandalorian's timeframe, with an untitled feature film directed by Filoni set to serve as a conclusion to the interconnected stories.\nBeginning five years after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983) and the fall of the Galactic Empire,[1][2]The Mandalorian follows Din Djarin, a lone Mandalorian bounty hunter in the outer reaches of the galaxy.[2] He is hired by Imperial remnant forces to retrieve the child Grogu, but instead goes on the run to protect the infant.[3][4] While looking to reunite Grogu with his kind, they are pursued by Moff Gideon, who wants to use Grogu's connection to the Force.[5][4] The duo then travel to Mandalore so Din Djarin can redeem himself for the transgression of removing his helmet.[6]\nSackhoff returns to star in the third season, while Swallow,[31] Weathers,[32] Sedaris,[33] Abtahi,[14] Varnado,[34] and Esposito returned as co-stars.[35] Wayne and Crowder receive co-star credit beginning with the third season.[36]\nStar Wars creator George Lucas began development on a live-action Star Wars television series known as Underworld in early 2009. More than 50 scripts were written for the series by 2012, but they were eventually deemed too expensive to produce.[37] In January 2013, ABC president Paul Lee stated that his network would be discussing potential live-action Star Wars television series with Lucasfilm after the latter had been sold by Lucas to ABC's parent company The Walt Disney Company in October 2012.[38] In November 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that Disney and Lucasfilm were developing a live-action Star Wars television series for the new streaming service Disney+.[39]\nWhile working on The Lion King (2019), a photo-realistic remake of the 1994 animated film, in 2017, director Jon Favreau pitched an idea he had for a Star Wars television series featuring Mandalorians to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.[40][41]Dave Filoni, executive producer on the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels, had also been conceiving a Mandalorian-focused series, and Kennedy suggested that he and Favreau meet to discuss their ideas.[41] Favreau and Filoni had previously met at the Skywalker Ranch when Favreau was working on Iron Man (2008) and Filoni was working on the first season of The Clone Wars, and Favreau subsequently voiced the Mandalorian character Pre Vizsla in The Clone Wars for Filoni.[9] When Favreau met with Filoni about his series idea, they were able to combine Filoni's knowledge of Mandalorian history with Favreau's lone-gunslinger concept.[41] Filoni also drew a doodle of a baby of the same species as the Star Wars character Yoda which became \"The Child\".[40] Favreau wanted to explore the \"scum and villainy\" of the Star Wars universe following the events of the film Return of the Jedi (1983).[9] He began spending several hours at the end of each day developing the series while he was directing The Lion King.[40]\nLucasfilm announced that Favreau would write and executive produce a new Star Wars series for Disney+ in March 2018. Kennedy added that the series was an opportunity for a diverse group of writers and directors to be hired to create Star Wars stories after the franchise's films had been criticized for being written and directed solely by white men.[42] In May, Favreau stated that he had written scripts for four of the series' eight episodes before being officially hired for the project.[43] On October 3, Favreau announced that the series was titled The Mandalorian and revealed the premise for the show.[2] The following day, Lucasfilm announced that Filoni, Kennedy, and Colin Wilson would executive produce the series alongside Favreau, with Karen Gilchrist acting as co-executive producer.[44] The series premiere was set to be available with the launch of Disney+ in November 2019.[45] Star Pedro Pascal described the series as taking the space Western undertones from the Star Wars films \"and infusing it with steroids\".[46]\nIn July 2019, Favreau confirmed that there would be a second season of the series and that he had begun writing it.[47] Iger announced in February 2020 that the second season would premiere that October.[48] By late April, Favreau had been writing a third season for \"a while\" and further development on the season was beginning.[49] In September, co-star Giancarlo Esposito said the second season would \"start to lay the groundwork for the depth and breadth that's going to come in season 3 and season 4, where you're really gonna start to get answers\".[50]Rick Famuyiwa, who directed in the first two seasons, was made an executive producer for the third season.[51] By late May 2022, Favreau was writing a fourth season,[52] noting it was being informed by the series Ahsoka (2023) and Skeleton Crew (2023).[52][53] Writing for the fourth season was completed by February 2023,[53] with pre-production occurring by that April. Filming was reportedly expected to begin by the end of 2023.[54]\nIn November 2018, Pedro Pascal was confirmed to be portraying the Mandalorian after being rumored to be cast in the role for some time.[7] Pascal initially thought he was being cast as the Star Wars character Boba Fett because of the visual similarities between that character and the Mandalorian,[55] but the latter is a separate character named Din Djarin.[8] Favreau called Pascal \"a classic movie star\" who \"had the presence and skill[s]\" necessary to portray a character largely concealed under a helmet.[56] The Mandalorian is also portrayed by stunt doubles Brendan Wayne, Lateef Crowder,[10] and Barry Lowin.[57] Pascal worked with Favreau and Filoni to record the character's dialogue later.[58][56]\nIn February 2021, Lucasfilm said Gina Carano, a recurring co-star during the first two seasons, was no longer employed by the company. This came after Carano made a social media post comparing being a Republican in the United States to the treatment of Jewish people during the Holocaust, with Lucasfilm saying the post was \"abhorrent and unacceptable\".[59] Carano had been repeatedly warned about her social media posts by Lucasfilm executives who reportedly had been looking for a reason to fire her for two months. The February 2021 posts were \"the final straw\", and the decision to fire the actress was made by Lucasfilm executives rather than Favreau.[59][60] The Walt Disney Company's then-CEO Bob Chapek said Carano was fired because her posts did not align with the values of Disney, which he said were \"universal\" and not political.[61]The Hollywood Reporter reported that Carano's role of Cara Dune was not expected to be recast, though industry insiders felt that was still a possibility because of story and merchandising reasons.[60]\nVisual effects studio Industrial Light & Magic, a subsidiary of Lucasfilm, opened a new division in November 2018 called ILM TV, specifically intended for episodic and streaming television. Based in London with support from ILM's San Francisco, Vancouver, and Singapore locations, one of the first projects for the new division was The Mandalorian.[69] While directing The Jungle Book (2016), Favreau had used large screens on set to create interactive lighting so when live-action footage was combined with a digital environment in post-production the effect would be more realistic. He found the process to be effective, but time-consuming.[70] When he began working on The Lion King, Favreau worked with visual effects vendor Moving Picture Company, technology developer Magnopus, and the game engine software Unity to develop a new virtual camera system that allowed him to film scenes in a virtual reality environment as if he was filming with physical cameras. For The Lion King, the results of the virtual photography were then rendered by MPC as the final animation for the film.[3] On The Mandalorian, Favreau wanted to use virtual technology to aid live-action photography and also develop the video wall system.[3][70] ILM partnered with video game developer Epic Games to create a new system named StageCraft based on Epic's game engine Unreal Engine. StageCraft consists of large LED video screens on which digital environments can be rendered in real-time for actors to perform in front of.[71][3]\nDuring pre-production, the virtual photography process developed for The Lion King was used to plan the series' filming and determine what environments would be needed on set. The digital environments were then created by ILM and added to StageCraft ready for live-action photography with the actors. Some of these environments were based on location photography in countries such as Iceland and Chile, on which Favreau said, \"The actors aren't brought on location. The location is brought to the actors.\"[3] The environments were designed by the series' visual art department, led by Lucasfilm's creative director Doug Chiang and production designer Andrew L. Jones.[72] During filming, the digital environments were rendered on a video wall in real-time, allowing the filmmakers and actors to see the environments.[71] ILM used a smaller version of the technology for Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), but on The Mandalorian they utilized a 21-foot-tall (6.4 m) set that was 75 feet (23 m) in diameter, surrounded by a 360-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling. The Manhattan Beach Studios set is referred to as a \"volume\", which is traditionally the name for motion capture stages.[71][3] Favreau's initial intention was to use the video wall as a way to provide realistic interactive lighting for the actors, with a section of the screen behind the actors displaying a green screen so a higher quality version of the background could be added in post-production. During filming tests with the technology, the team realized that the Unreal Engine could render visuals fast enough that they could have the background move with the camera. This allowed the system to maintain the appearance of parallax, where the environment would appear differently based on the angle it was being looked at just as a real 3D environment would. This effect causes some distortion to the image on the video wall but looks like a real environment when viewed through the camera.[70] The images rendered on the video wall in real-time were often of a high enough quality to be used as final effects when filmed on set.[71]\nPhysical elements were added to the volume to match the digital backgrounds, such as dirt on the floor to match the dirt displayed on the video wall.[70] Interior spaces were also created, such as an office used by Imperial agents where the walls and ceiling were displayed on the video wall around a physical table.[71] The production had several physical sections of the Razor Crest, the Mandalorian's ship, that could be placed within the volume, such as having the front half of the ship physically built and the back half rendered digitally.[70][71] The environments could be manipulated in StageCraft on set as required, allowing the filmmakers to request changes to the environment and have them rendered on the video wall on the same day.[71] The production was able to change between environments within half an hour, or even faster if the physical elements within the volume were not visible and did not need to be changed.[70] One of the primary advantages of using video wall technology was the realistic lighting, with the wall providing ambient light and accurate reflections on the actors. This was especially important for the Mandalorian, who wears reflective armor. Traditionally, on production using a green screen, the visual effects team would have to remove the green reflections from a reflective character or object in post-production, and then add new reflections that matched the digital environment. Using StageCraft, the reflections in the Mandalorian's armor were already correct on set. It also allowed for the series' cinematographers to light scenes in a way that would match the background, rather than lighting the set and hoping the digital background would match in post-production as they would have to do with the green screen. A technique used by the production to ensure the lighting from the video wall looked natural was to have the actors in shadow, with light from the environment behind them, often creating silhouettes.[70]\nComposer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson was recommended by several of his previous collaborators to Favreau, including directors Ryan Coogler and Anthony and Joe Russo, and musician Donald Glover. Favreau knew that music would be important to the series due to the impact of John Williams' score on the Star Wars films, but also wanted the music of the series to be different from the films. He wanted the series to sound \"a little grittier, a little edgier and a little more tech-oriented\".[73] G\u00f6ransson first met with Favreau in November 2018,[74] when Favreau showed the composer concept art for the series and discussed his inspirations for the story and tone, including Western and samurai films. They also discussed how they felt when they first heard Williams' Star Wars music, and G\u00f6ransson set out to recreate those feelings and \"capture the soul of what Star Wars is\" but in a new way.[75]\nG\u00f6ransson was announced as the composer for the series in December 2018.[76] The basis of the main theme was created from G\u00f6ransson experimenting with a bass recorder, digitally manipulating it to make it more \"futuristic\". Guitars, a piano, drums, and synthesizers are also featured in the main theme.[75] A 70-piece orchestra was used for the first season,[73][74] combined with recordings of G\u00f6ransson playing the main instruments which he augmented with synthesizers and other digital manipulation.[74]Walt Disney Records released a soundtrack album for each episode of the first season.[74] Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, orchestra players were recorded remotely or in smaller, distant groups for the second season.[5] Two albums were released for the second season, each covering four episodes of the season.[77][78] In February 2023, Joseph Shirley was revealed to be scoring the third season. Shirley previously provided additional music for the first two seasons and used G\u00f6ransson's themes to compose the score for The Book of Boba Fett.[79]\nOne of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the father\u2013son relationship dynamic between Din Djarin and the Child.[80][81][82] Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote that this is unusual in Star Wars stories and that past examples of parenting in the franchise have tended to be poor ones, from the murderous Darth Vader, father of Luke Skywalker, to the neglectful Galen Erso, father of Jyn Erso in Rogue One (2016).[80] Britt wrote: \"For years the Star Wars franchise avoided depicting a parent-child dynamic. With Mando and Baby Yoda, that's finally changing.\"[80] The dynamic between Kuiil and IG-11 also reflect the childrearing theme in The Mandalorian. The two have a relationship similar to that of a father and son, as demonstrated in the scene in which Kuiil teaches IG-11 how to operate and function after the droid is reprogrammed.[83]\nVulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk argued that parenting has been the subject of past Star Wars stories, but almost always during later stages of parenthood, rather than an infant in early stages such as the Child. As examples, she cited Obi-Wan Kenobi serving as a mentor to the adolescent Anakin Skywalker, Princess Leia lamenting over her grown son Kylo Ren, or the absence of Rey's parents.[84] Britt argued strong parental examples in Star Wars are important because the franchise is so often associated with the childhoods of its fans.[80]The Mandalorian particularly highlights the challenges of being a single parent[81][82] and a working parent since the Mandalorian struggles to continue his day job as a bounty hunter and mercenary while serving as the sole caretaker of the Child.[84][82] Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter described the show as \"the adventures of a single dad looking for a job\".[85] Several reviewers have compared the dynamic between the Child and the Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub, a manga about a samurai warrior and his young son.[86][87][88][89] Favreau acknowledged Lone Wolf and Cub as an influence in an episode of Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian.[90]\nThe Mandalorian's parental role in the series makes him a softer and more relatable character;[91] he changes in a positive way because of raising the Child, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed.[92] He risked his life and drastically changed his career as a bounty hunter to accept his responsibility as the Child's caretaker and guardian,[81][82] marking a significant parental sacrifice.[82] When the Mandalorian seeks work to earn money, he is now doing so to provide not only for himself, but for the Child as well.[81] We see several examples of the Mandalorian parenting the Child throughout the series, such as when he stops the Child from pressing random buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship, ultimately by holding him in his lap.[80] In another example, the Mandalorian establishes a car seat for the Child in the cockpit of his ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their travels.[93]\nThe relationship between the Mandalorian and the Child is an example of unexpected fatherhood.[84][92] The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".[84] Nevertheless, fatherhood is not a role the Mandalorian initially seeks, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility. He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he first leaves the Child with the Client.[92] He does so again in \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\" when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan, who is willing to take the Child into her own family. The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first-season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\" when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.[84] He nonetheless continues to search for what he feels may be a more appropriate guardian for the Child, as in the second season's fifth episode, \"The Jedi\", in which he seeks to leave him with Ahsoka Tano.[94]\nSeveral writers suggested the fact that the Mandalorian's face is concealed has a tabula rasa effect and his anonymity allows viewers to see and imagine themselves as parents.[80][81] Britt said this \"allow(s) us to dream about what arsenal we might deploy to protect our children\".[80] However, Singer said the show's setting in space make the challenges of child-rearing seem more exciting and exotic than they might otherwise be.[81] Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent's psyche like a dentist's drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"[95] Likewise, Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"The Mandalorian is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"[84] VanAnderonk described this as a wish fulfillment fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that's left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".[84]\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.[84] Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,[81] as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.[81][96] An interaction the Mandalorian has with Peli Motto in \"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger\" is one of the most overt discussions about the challenges of caring for the Child. When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"[84] She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".[97]ScreenCrush writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.[81] Eileen Chase of Today echoed this: \"He is not an ideal parent, just like the rest of us who have to balance parenting and work.\"[82]\nThe nature of good and evil and the question of nature versus nurture is raised repeatedly throughout The Mandalorian, perhaps most overtly through Kuiil's reprogramming of IG-11 from a bounty hunter to a nurse droid and protector.[98][99] Even after IG-11 is reprogrammed, the Mandalorian does not believe he has truly changed, because he believes droids have an essential nature and that IG-11's nature remains murderous and untrustworthy.[100] But in reprogramming IG-11, Kuiil nurtures him and helps him to change; Kuiil feels that in the process of learning how to function again, IG-11 gained a new personality.[101] Kuiil insists to the Mandalorian: \"Droids are not good or bad \u2014 they are neutral reflections of those who program them.\"[99] Keith Phipps of Vulture wrote of IG-11 and the nature versus nurture theme: \"He's not bad. He's just programmed that way, and with care and change he can do a lot of good in the world.\"[98]\nThe Kuiil and IG-11 scenes also demonstrate that how the \"child\" character is raised makes a significant difference in whether the child becomes an asset or a threat to those around him. The droid was a dangerous assassin before Kuiil reprogrammed him, but thanks to the Ugnaught's parenting, he becomes a protector and helper instead.[83] Some writers have likewise suggested the Child is not inherently good or evil,[99][102] but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him. He is learning about the world around him and needs guidance as he develops his abilities.[96][99][103] It will largely fall to the Mandalorian to provide this guidance,[96] as when the Mandalorian stops him from strangling Cara Dune.[99]\nHowever, multiple writers have questioned whether the violent acts the Child has repeatedly witnessed throughout The Mandalorian are hurting his development and that he is learning to become violent himself as a result.[99][104] Phipps wrote of this: \"That look of wonder in the Child's eyes as IG-11 kills and kills again is hilarious, but also a little chilling.\"[98] One particular scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many reviewers and fans to question whether the Child may be demonstrating evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly arm wrestling match. During the contest, the Child uses the Force to choke Cara, nearly strangling her before the Mandalorian intervened.[102][103][104] Throughout the Star Wars franchise, that ability has been most commonly associated with the Dark Side of the Force, particularly Darth Vader.[104][105][106]\nSarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant wrote: \"The moment is genuinely shocking \u2014 and more than a little disturbing.\"[99] Some reviewers noted, however, that the Child likely mistakenly believed the Mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help.[106][107] Additionally, in the same episode, the Child uses Force healing to save Greef Karga, a power typically associated with the Light Side.[99][102][107] Nevertheless, some writers have suggested viewers had been underestimating the Child's capacity for evil because he is so adorable.[106][105][108] Fans speculated the Child could be presenting a false personality or using the Force to manipulate people into caring about him to help ensure his survival.[104] However, Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle suggested rather than building toward making the Child evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.[104]\nAccording to Nielsen, The Mandalorian's first season amassed 5.42 billion minutes of viewing time during its seven-week run, topping at 1.15 billion minutes during the week its finale premiered.[112] It added 800 million more minutes the week after its finale.[112] According to Nielsen, the second season became the most watched streaming television series in the U.S. from December 14 to December 20, with 1.336 billion minutes of viewing time.[113] It also ranked at the fourteenth place on Nielsen's list of most watched streaming television shows and movies of 2020 with 14.5 billion minutes watched during the year.[113] The show became the first non-Netflix show that landed at number one on Nielsen's streaming ranker.[114] According to Samba TV, the show's second season drew 1.04 million households.[115]The Hollywood Reporter reported that The Mandalorian lead Disney+'s live action series with the majority minutes (8.4 billion) came from the eight weeks the second season debuted.[112]\nFor the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating with an average rating of 7.9/10 based on 337 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Action-packed and expertly-crafted\u2014if at times a bit too withholding\u2014The Mandalorian is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe that benefits greatly from the cuteness of its cargo.\"[116]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 70 out of 100 for the season, based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[117]\nFor the second season, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating with an average score of 8.5/10, based on 450 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"With fan favorites and fresh faces galore both in front of and behind the camera, The Mandalorian's sophomore season solidifies its place as one of Star Wars's most engaging and exciting sagas.\"[118] Metacritic assigned a score of 76 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[119]\nFor the third season, Rotten Tomatoes has reported a 85% approval rating with an average score of 7.55/10, based on 239 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Mileage may vary by a couple parsecs as The Mandalorian becomes more and more about the connective tissue of broader Star Wars lore, but this remains one of the most engaging adventures in a galaxy far, far away.\"[120] Metacritic has assigned a score of 70 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[121]\nThe Mandalorian was the first production to be filmed using real-time rendering for realistic, parallax environments.[70] Favreau believed that the StageCraft technology developed for the series would have a significant impact on the production of films and television series moving forward.[71] He attributed the breakthroughs made with the technology to the support of Kathleen Kennedy, who was in charge of both Lucasfilm and ILM, as well as to his drive for innovation, and to previous work done by George Lucas on new technology for the Star Wars films. Favreau also acknowledged that much of the technology involved in StageCraft is not proprietary and is readily available to others, it just had not been combined in this way before.[70] Favreau invited other filmmakers and studios to visit the series' set and see how the new technology was being used, noting that Lucas and other filmmakers such as James Cameron had done the same when they had been working on innovative film projects. Favreau added that the companies working on the series' new technologies\u2014including ILM, Epic, and MPC\u2014were being encouraged to share their work and develop the technology further beyond the requirements of the series.[3] Several actors working on the series, including Carl Weathers and Giancarlo Esposito, gave high praise to the technology and the way it allowed them to act within the environment rather than pretend in front of a green screen.[70] After learning lessons about the technology during the production of the first season of The Mandalorian, ILM was able to make several advancements beginning with the second season. This included transitioning StageCraft to a fully in-house product utilizing ILM's game engine, Helios, rather than Epic's Unreal Engine.[72] In February 2020, ILM announced that it was making its StageCraft technology available to all filmmakers and production studios as a complete end-to-end solution,[71] and that December, it was announced that three additional StageCraft volumes\u2013in Los Angeles, London, and Australia\u2013were being built.[134]\nIn November 2019, Walt Disney Studios CCO Alan Horn said if the series was successful, a film featuring the Mandalorian could be developed.[135] The next month, Favreau said there was an opportunity to explore the series' characters in other Star Wars films or television series.[3] Bob Iger said in February 2020 that spin-offs of The Mandalorian were being considered, and there was potential to add more characters to the series to then give them their series.[136] Favreau said in October that as more characters are introduced in the series, \"we are beginning to explore where we could go\". He felt Lucasfilm could be \"more responsive\" to audience reactions in determining potential spin-offs due to the faster production time for television series than films. Favreau looked to his experience working in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where smaller stories exist within the larger narrative, as a potential guide for spin-offs. Additionally, both Favreau and Pascal were open to the idea of the Mandalorian appearing in a Star Wars film, but Favreau was in \"no rush\" to do this.[137]\nIn December 2020, the spin-off series Rangers of the New Republic, Ahsoka, and The Book of Boba Fett were announced,[138][139][140] with all three series developed by Favreau and Filoni, set within The Mandalorian's timeframe and planned to culminate in a \"climactic story event\".[141] Before Lucasfilm announced that Carano was no longer employed by the company in February 2021, The Hollywood Reporter had reported that there was potential for her to star in Rangers of the New Republic.[59] Active development on the series had not begun by that May,[142] and it was still on hold in November when Kennedy said the development had not reached a point where scripts were written. She said there was potential for ideas from the series to be incorporated into The Mandalorian's \"next iteration\".[143] A new series, Skeleton Crew, was announced in May 2022 after being developed by Jon Watts and Christopher Ford. Favreau and Filoni were revealed to be serving as executive producers on the series,[144] which is also set in the timeframe of The Mandalorian and Ahsoka.[145]\nFavreau discussed the spin-offs in August 2022, explaining that The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew were all set in the same timeframe\u2014during the 30 years between Return of the Jedi and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)\u2014which had \"a lot of room for us to tell stories, and there are a lot of characters that are in play because we know who's around at that time\". He noted that they were using The Mandalorian to remind fans of these characters or introduce them to unfamiliar audiences before they appeared in the spin-off series, which created interconnected stories and characters within a \"very rich fabric for us to explore\".[146]\nA spin-off miniseries focused on Boba Fett was reported in November 2020.[147] It was officially announced as The Book of Boba Fett a month later and was already in production by that point. Favreau, Filoni, and Robert Rodriguez executive produced, with Morrison and Wen reprising their respective roles as Fett and Fennec Shand.[140] Pascal, Swallow, Sedaris,[148] Olyphant, Dawson, and Hamill also reprise their roles,[149] along with Favreau as the voice of Paz Vizsla, Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Carson Teva,[148] and W. Earl Brown as the Weequay bartender.[150] Grogu also appears.[149] The seven-episode series was released from December 2021 to February 2022.[151]\nA limited series titled Ahsoka, featuring Dawson reprising her role as Ahsoka Tano, was revealed in December 2020 with Filoni writing and executive producing alongside Favreau.[139] The series premiered on August 22, 2023.[152] Lee reprises his role as Carson Teva in the series,[153] while Brendan Wayne appears as Lieutenant Lander.[154]\nA new series, Skeleton Crew, was announced in May 2022 after being developed by Jon Watts and Christopher Ford. Favreau and Filoni were revealed to be serving as executive producers on the series,[144] which is also set in the timeframe of The Mandalorian and Ahsoka.[145] The series is scheduled to be released in 2023.[155]\nIn December 2020, it was revealed that The Mandalorian and its related series were planned to culminate in a \"climactic story event\".[141] At Star Wars Celebration London in April 2023, it was announced that Filoni was directing a feature film that would serve as the conclusion to the interconnected stories of The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka, among others.[156]\nA documentary series, Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian, features interviews with the cast and crew of The Mandalorian, behind-the-scenes footage, and roundtable conversations hosted by Favreau that explore the production of the series. The first season premiered on Disney+ on May 4, 2020, Star Wars Day.[157] An hour-long special covering the second season was released on December 25, 2020,[158] with a second special episode covering the season two finale released on August 25, 2021.[159] A special covering the third season was released on June 28, 2023.[160]\nLucasfilm announced a publishing campaign of tie-in books and comics for the series in June 2020.

        "question": "What is Cristiano Ronaldo's current club?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo#:~:text=Current%20team,Al%20Nassr",
        "context": "\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \u20ac94 million (\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \u20ac100 million (\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[20] where his father was the kit man,[12] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \u00a31,500.[21] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy.[21] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[22] With a troubled life as a student[23] and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[24][25] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \"disrespected\" him.[22] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[26] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[27] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[28] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.[29]\nRonaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP's museum\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6l\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[30] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[21]Sporting CP B was the 1st team in his senior career, where he debuted in a 2\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores.[31] On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\u20130 win.[32] Over the course of the 2002\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[33] Manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[34]\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[35] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \u00a312.24 million[35] for what he considered to be \"one of the most exciting young players\" he had ever seen.[36] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[37]\n\"There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me.\"\n\u2014Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003.[38]\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[39] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[40] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[41] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[42] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\"[43]\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[44] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\" he had ever seen.[38] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[45] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[46] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[47] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[48] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[49] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \"elaborate\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[50] but teammate Gary Neville said he was \"not a show pony, but the real thing\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[51]\n\"He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening.\"\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough.[52] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010.[53] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[54][55] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\u20134.[56] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.[57]\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \"one-fingered gesture\" towards Benfica fans,[58] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[59] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[60] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[61] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[62] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[63]\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\u201307 season,[64] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[65] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[66][67][68] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[69]\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table.[82] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\u20130 win.[83] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[84] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[85] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[86] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[87][88] In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\u20131 on aggregate;[89] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\u20130 aggregate win over Roma.[90] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[91] United emerged victorious 1\u20131, winning the penalties 6\u20135.[92][93] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[94]\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[95] As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[96] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \"modern slavery\".[97] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[98] he remained at United for another year.[99]\nRonaldo in 2009 with Manchester United playing in a Premier League game against Liverpool\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[108] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[109] United advanced to the final in Rome,[110] where he made little impact in United's 2\u20130 defeat to Barcelona.[111] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup.[112][113] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[114] His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.[115]\nAs his usual number 7 was unavailable, Ronaldo wore number 9 during his debut season at Madrid. After Ra\u00fal departed the club, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt before the 2010\u201311 season.\nAhead of the 2009\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million).[116] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \u20ac11 million per year and contained a \u20ac1 billion buy-out clause.[117] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[118] Since club captain Ra\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[119] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[120]\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\u20132 home win.[121] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[122] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\u00fcrich.[123] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[124][125] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\u00eda.[126] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga,[127][128] and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.[129][130]\nFollowing Ra\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\u201311 season.[131] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[132] Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\u00e1laga.[133][134][135] Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[136] During a historic series of four Cl\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain.[137][138] His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[139] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[140]\nRonaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain.\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions.[141] He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.[142][143][144] Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona,[145] he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s.[146] Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.[147] His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi,[148] though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.[149]\nRonaldo began the 2012\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona.[150] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \"professional issue\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,[151] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\u20131 win over Ajax.[152] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\u20132 draw at Camp Nou.[153] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[154]\nFollowing the 2012\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January.[155] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[156] Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.[157] He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\u20132 win against M\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.[158] He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[159] a club record.[150] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct.[160] In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw at home,[161] he scored the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford.[162] He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect.[163] After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\u20130 win in the second leg.[164]\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before.[173] After hitting a brace in a 4\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena,[174] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\u20131 final win over Atl\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[175] His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\".[176] As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[177] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[178]\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n,[179] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.[180] His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\u20131 to claim the trophy.[181] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\u00e1rez.[182] Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\u00e9bio, who had died two days before.[183] A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional,[184] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[185]\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season Ronaldo scored a personal best of 61 goals in all competitions.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[186] He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds.[187] His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches.[187][188] After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup,[189] Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or,[190] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient.[191] Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League.[192] In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\u20130 win against Schalke 04.[193] He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\u20132 on aggregate.[194] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[195] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\u20131 rout of Granada.[196] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano.[197] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\u00e9fano's club record of 28.[186] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[186]\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\u00fal.[198] A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals.[note 4] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[200] Two goals against Malm\u00f6 FF in a 2\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country.[201] He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\u00f6.[202]\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi.[203] He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals.[204] The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.[205] Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atl\u00e9tico, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory.[206] For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions.[206] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.[207]\nIn the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2\u20131 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[216] In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4\u20132 after extra-time.[217] On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atl\u00e9tico 3\u20130 in the Champions League semi-final first leg. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo.[218] He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012.[219] In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4\u20131 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career.[220] Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.[221]\nAt the start of the 2017\u201318 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3\u20131 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg.[222] On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.[223] On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund.[224] A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.[225] On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Gr\u00eamio in the final.[226] On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3\u20131 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi.[227] On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6\u20133 win against Girona.[228]\nOn 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3\u20130 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a \"PlayStation goal\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches.[229] On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3\u20131 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4\u20133 on aggregate.[230] It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club.[231] In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3\u20131, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so.[232] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals.[233] After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.[234]\nDespite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,[235] on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a \u20ac100 million transfer, which included an additional \u20ac12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs.[236] The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[237] and the highest paid by an Italian club.[238] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[239] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino P\u00e9rez.[240]\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3\u20132 away win against Chievo Verona.[241] On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2\u20131 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career.[242] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for \"violent conduct\", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances.[243] Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107's winner in a 1\u20130 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition.[244] In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3\u20130 away win over Fiorentina.[245] After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modri\u0107, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate.[246] Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.[247]\nOn 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3\u20130 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal.[248] On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 home win against Atl\u00e9tico in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals.[249] The following month, he scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening the scoring in a 1\u20131 away draw in the quarter-final first leg against Ajax on 10 April.[250] In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, he scored the opening goal, but Juventus eventually lost the match 2\u20131 and were eliminated from the competition.[251] On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2\u20131 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy.[252] On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser in a 1\u20131 away draw against Derby d'Italia rivals Inter Milan.[253] Ending his first Serie A campaign with 21 goals and 8 assists, Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A award for Most Valuable Player.[254]\nOn 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2\u20130 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history.[264] On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal from a free kick in a 4\u20131 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar S\u00edvori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts.[265] On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2\u20131 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season.[266][267] Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[268] On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2\u20130 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[269] He finished his second league

2\u20131 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season.[272] Despite the win, the tie finished 2\u20132 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.[273]\nOn 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus's opening league match of the season, a 3\u20130 home win over Sampdoria.[274] On 1 November, having taken nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4\u20131 away win.[275] On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match, his 750th senior career goal.[276] Ronaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13

3\u20131 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat.[281] With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy.[282] Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.[283]\nOn 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for \u00c1lvaro Morata in a 2\u20132 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR.[284] Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window,[285] and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had \"no intention\" of remaining a Juventus player.[286] On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms,[287] but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer.[288] On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him,[289][290] while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.[291][292]\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[293] The transfer was for an initial \u00a312.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.[294] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[295] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[296]\nRonaldo in a Premier League match against Newcastle in September 2021, his first game back at Manchester United\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4\u20131 league victory against Newcastle United.[297] On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2\u20131 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.[298] In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\u20132 home victory against Atalanta,[299] and scored both goals, including a last minute equaliser, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November.[300] On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2\u20130 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners.[301] On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3\u20132 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.[302]\nThe following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal,[303] before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2\u20130 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022.[304] Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3\u20132 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals,[305] although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals.[306] On 16 April, Ronaldo scored his 50th club hat-trick in a 3\u20132 win over Norwich City.[307] On 23 April, he scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to Arsenal.[308] After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.[309]\nHe finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season;[310][311] however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.[312]\nAfter growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans.[313] His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer.[314] However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wages demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.[315]\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2\u20130 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September.[316] On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6\u20133 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of \"respect for his big career\".[317] On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2\u20131 win against Everton.[318] Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle;[319][320] Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team.[321][322] Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage.[323] Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\".[324] Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.[325]\nOn 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \"betrayed\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \"because he doesn't show respect for me\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club.[326] Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early.[326] He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \"sporting director and not even a coach\".[326][327] On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \"no evolution\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \"technology, infrastructure\".[326][327] Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \"did not care about the club\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \"marketing club\".[326][327] Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract,[328] and were looking to terminate his contract.[329] On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.[330]\nRonaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1\u20130 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022.[336] On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo scored twice in a 5\u20134 loss.[337] He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\u20130 win over Al-Ettifaq,[338] and scored his first goal in a 2\u20132 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty.[339] On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4\u20130 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal.[340] On 25 February, he scored his second hat-trick for the club, helping his side to a 3\u20130 away league victory against Damac.[341] Ronaldo was awarded the Player of the Month award for February after scoring eight goals and assisting twice.[342] Ronaldo spent another season without winning a league title, as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022\u201323 season.[343]\nHe scored his first goal of the 2023\u201324 season in a 4\u20131 win over Union Monastirienne in the Arab Club Champions Cup on 31 July.[345] In the next Arab Club Champions Cup fixture on 3 August, Ronaldo scored a late equaliser against Zamalek, to help his side secure a 1\u20131 draw and qualify for the quarter-finals in second place of their group.[346] In the semi-finals on 9 August, Ronaldo scored the only goal of a win over Al-Shorta, converting a penalty to help Al Nassr reach their first ever Arab Club Champions Cup final.[347] In the final on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals for a ten-man Al Nassr as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2\u20131 after extra time to win the competition for the first time in their history. Ronaldo was awarded the competition's top scorer award having scored six goals in the competition.[348]\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his first league appearance of the season in a 2\u20130 defeat to Al-Taawoun,[349] and scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 5\u20130 away win against Al-Fateh a week later.[350] On 29 August, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted once in a 4\u20130 win against rivals Al-Shabab.[351] Ronaldo was awarded the SPL Player of the Month award for August after scoring five goals and assisting twice.[352] On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr's 5\u20131 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal.[353] On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2\u20130 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws).[354] Ronaldo received the SPL Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after recording five goals and three assists in September.[355] On 2 October, he scored his first AFC Champions League goal in the home fixture against Istiklol, the equaliser in an eventual 3\u20131 win.[356]\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.[7]\nAged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1\u20130 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003,[357] coming on as a half-time substitute for Lu\u00eds Figo.[358] He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2\u20131 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal.[358] After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals,[359] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2\u20131 win over the Netherlands.[360] He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.[361]\nRonaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals.[357] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage.[362] At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[363] In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz.[358] Following Portugal's 1\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game.[364] In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[365] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[358][366] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals.[358] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\u20130 semi-final defeat to France.[367] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[358][368] Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.[369][370]\nRonaldo, pictured playing against Germany at Euro 2012, was made captain for Portugal in 2008.\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007,[371] as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.[371] Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.[372] While he scored eight goals in qualifications,[373] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance.[374][375] Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.[376]\nAfter Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.[377] Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008.[378] Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup,[358] as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[379] In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[380][381][382] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months.[383] Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[384]\nRonaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \"group of death\".[385] In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\u20131 win.[386] He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\u20130 win.[387] In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match.[388][389] After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out.[390] Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot.[391] Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \"demanded\" to take the last penalty.[392] As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.[8]\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap.[393] His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013.[394] After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament.[395] His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record.[396] Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.[397]\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury,[398] potentially risking his career.[399] Ronaldo later commented: \"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\"[400] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[401] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\u20130 defeat.[402] After assisting an injury-time 2\u20132 equaliser against the United States,[403] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\u20131 win over Ghana.[404] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.[405] Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.[404]\nRonaldo leaps in the air in Portugal's Euro 2016 quarter-final match against Poland.\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016.[406] With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer.[407] At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half.[408] With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament.[409][410] Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format,[411] despite not winning any of their games.[358]\nIn Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\u0161i\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\u20130 win late in extra time.[358] After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty,[358] he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals;[412] he scored the opener in a 2\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals.[413] In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on,[358] he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\u20130 victory.[414] As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.[415][416]\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.[417]\nIn Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\u20132 draw.[418] Three days later, he scored in a 1\u20130 win over hosts Russia.[419] On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s.[420][421] He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches.[422] Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children,[423] and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\u20131 after extra time.[424]\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals.[425] These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose.[426] Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\u20130 win.[427]\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so.[428] On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals.[429] In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain.[430] On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16.[431] For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.[432]\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan.[433] In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\u20130.[434]\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match;[435] in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals.[436] He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40,[437] while also completing his eighth international hat-trick.[438] On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier.[439] On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020.[440] On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe.[441][442] On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic.[443] By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.[444]\nThe Est\u00e1dio Algarve (exterior pictured) where Ronaldo broke the international goalscoring record (surpassing the 109 goals of Iran's Ali Daei) in September 2021, among other records in the course of the same year\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest.[445] This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history.[446] He also became the first player to score at five Euros,[447] and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition,[448] and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament.[449] On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals.[450] On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16.[451] Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.[452]\nRonaldo during a group stage game against Uruguay at the 2022 World Cup\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups.[456] In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted.[457] He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament,[458] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.[459] He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick.[460] Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.[461][462]\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.[463] On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time.[464] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country.[465] On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history.[466]\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[467] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[468] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[469][470] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[471] he has also been known to use the flip-flap.[472]\nRonaldo controlling the ball on his chest during a 2010\u201311 La Liga game against Almer\u00eda. At his peak, he was known for his exceptional speed and athleticism.[473]\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[474][475][476] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[469][474]\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[474] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[474] An accurate penalty kick taker,[477] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bendingfree kicks.[478] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[479] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[480] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\"[481]\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[483] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[483][484][485] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[486][487][488] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \"false\", \"attacking\", or \"goalscoring winger\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[484][489] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[483][490][491] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[492][493][494]\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 or 4\u20133\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[495][496] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\u017euki\u0107 in a 4\u20133\u20131\u20132, 4\u20134\u20132, or 3\u20135\u20132 formation.[497][498][499] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.[496]\n\"In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player.\"\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi.[501] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[502] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[503] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[504] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[505]\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[506][507] On his longevity and \"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\"[482] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\"[508] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring.[509] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[510] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[511] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[512]Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \"his relative immobility\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[513]\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \"arrogant image\" on the pitch,[514] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \"victim\" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[515] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[514] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[515] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[516][517][518]\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[519][520][521] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \"storming jump\" and \"turn\", before \"landing in spread-eagled fashion\"[520] into his \"signature power stance\",[521] while usually simultaneously exclaiming \"S\u00ed\" (Spanish and Italian for \"yes\").[519][522] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \"Sii\" in the media.[519][520][523]\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[524] It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[525][526] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two.[527] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[528][529][530]\n\"It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent.\"\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\"[532]Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\"[533] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\"[534] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\"[531] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[535]\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \"commander\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[536] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\"[537]\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \"gone\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \"sharing the stage\".[538]\nThe Cristiano Ronaldo Museum, Museu CR7, in Funchal, Madeira. It was opened on 15 December 2013.\nAs his reputation grew from his time at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition,[539] soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games.[540][541][542][543] Ronaldo was featured as the cover star of EA Sports' FIFA video gameFIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion.[544] His \"Sii\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover.[519] He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.[545]\nWith earnings of \u20ac720 million (\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr..[546]Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\u201315.[547][548] The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes.[549] In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\u201316.[550] He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\u201317.[551] He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career.[552] Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012[553] and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013, with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists.[553][554] Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014.[555] He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world.[556]ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.[557][558][559][560]\nStatue of Ronaldo, in Madeira, resembles the pose he strikes before taking free kicks.[561]\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers.[562] The most-followed person on Facebook (160 million), the most-followed on Instagram (557 million) and the most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (107 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 to June 2017.[551] Ronaldo has released two mobile apps. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive,[563] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app.[564] Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.[565]\nRonaldo has been the subject of several works. His autobiography, titled Moments, was published in December 2007.[566] His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was consequently subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011.[527]Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014.[567] A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.[568][569]\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product.[570] In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt.[571] In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.[572]\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008.[573] In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013.[574] He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014.[575][576] In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \"Legacy\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.[577]\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus).[578] In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia;[579] the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\u00e3o da Madeira.[580][581] At a ceremony held at the Bel\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\"[582] A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.[583]\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London.[584] Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013.[585] In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.[586]\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport.[587] The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented.[588] The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live,[589] while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque.[590][588] A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust;[591] however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.[592]\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.[595][596] After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira.[597] In 2009, Ronaldo donated \u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island.[598] In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\u00edtimo and Nacional.[599]\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.[600] In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's \"11 for Health\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity.[601] In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.[602] In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.[603]\nRonaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating \u00a35 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people.[604] In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition.[604] In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.[605]\nRonaldo has five children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States.[606] He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her.[607][608] In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.[609]\nRonaldo became a father to twins,[610] born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\u00edguez,[611] who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017.[612] The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.[613][614]\nRonaldo's father, Jos\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.[615]\nIn January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\".[616]\nRonaldo is of Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother.[617] He is a Roman Catholic.[618]\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time.[621] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[622]\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[623]\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[624][625] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[624][626] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \"intentional defamation campaign\" with parts significantly \"altered and/or completely fabricated\",[627][628] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied.[629] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"[630] The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civillawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape.[631]The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo.[632] In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\" the case, despite the documents containing \"privileged communications\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\" during the 2010 settlement with her.[633] In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \"cyber-hacked attorney-client privileged documents\" were actions representing \"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\".[631][634]\n^Real Madrid had previously recognised Ronaldo as their all-time top scorer after he scored a brace against Malm\u00f6 FF on 30 September 2015. The club's official record book attributes to Ronaldo a 74th-minute goal in a 2\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 18 September 2010, despite his free-kick having been deflected by Pepe.[199]",

The group made over $1.1 billion combined and includes three soccer stars, three basketball players, two golfers, a boxer and a now-retired tennis player.\nHere's a look at the biggest paydays for athletes on and off the field over the last year:\nCristiano Ronaldo\u2019s ugly exit from Manchester United wound up helping his bank account. The Portuguese superstar left Europe to sign with Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr and now has an estimated annual salary of $75 million. His appeal to brands off the field is also evident, as he has more combined followers across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter than any other athlete on Earth.\nLionel Messi\u2019s PSG future is over, but coming off his first career World Cup title, the Argentine legend is still raking in dough. About half of his money came from PSG, while endorsements from Adidas, Budweiser, PepsiCo, Socios and more effectively doubled his earnings.\nNext in the 35-year-old's chapter is MLS, which he announced would be his next destination. Concrete details on his potential salary are not yet known due to MLS' financial rules, so it'll be interesting to see how much the club pays him along with possible endorsement deals.\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 is the youngest player in Forbes\u2019 top 10 at just 24 years old. With one World Cup title under his belt and another World Cup Final appearance in 2022, the PSG phenom has already become one of the world\u2019s most recognizable athletes. A majority of his earnings come from his whopping salary with the French club.\nHere are five things to know about Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, World Cup winner and forward for Paris Saint-Germain.\nLeBron James is the top-earning American athlete on Forbes\u2019 list. On top of becoming the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer this year, James also became the first active athlete to become a certified billionaire by Forbes last June. On top of his Lakers salary, James has a lifetime deal with Nike and has a stake in Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool FC and the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nCanelo \u00c1lvarez made big bucks with his fights against Dmitry Bivol and Gennadiy Golovkin. He makes the vast majority of his money in the ring compared to endorsements, and he will add to his total during his bout against John Ryder on May 6.\nLike Ronaldo, Johnson was one of two golfers who earned nine-figure paydays over the last 12 months after making the move to a Saudi-financed organization. Dustin Johnson joined LIV Golf in 2022 for a staggering signing fee, and wound up making $35.6 million in prize money during play in less than 10 tournaments on the rouge tour.\nRight behind Johnson is Phil Mickelson, who is relying on on-course results for earnings after losing sponsors with his move to LIV. The new golf league handed Mickelson a contract in the ballpark of $200 million to join last year. The 52-year-old lefty returned to hallowed grounds and earned $1.6 million by tying for second place at the 2023 Masters.\nSteph Curry is the eighth and final athlete to surpass the $100 million threshold over the last year. He won his fourth NBA Finals with the Golden State Warriors last June and had the league\u2019s highest 2022-23 salary at $48.1 million. Off the court, Curry was swept into a lawsuit after FTX collapsed, but he has a lucrative deal with Under Armour and is expanding his media ventures with his company, Unanimous Media, to make up for that loss.\nRoger Federer called it a career last September, but his sponsors are staying put. The Swiss tennis icon has over a dozen long-term partners that helped him earn $95 million off the court in the last year, per Forbes.\nIt\u2019s been a hectic 12 months for Kevin Durant, but he\u2019s been getting paid at every stop. The former Brooklyn Net was traded to the Phoenix Suns in February, but his $40-plus million salary came with him.

        "question": "How many asteroids have been discovered before impacting Earth?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_impact_prediction#List_of_successfully_predicted_asteroid_impacts",
        "context": "\n2008 TC3 was the first successfully predicted asteroid impact. This picture shows the estimated path and altitude of the meteor in red, with the possible location for the METEOSAT IR fireball (bolide) as orange crosshairs and the infrasound detection of the explosion in green\nAsteroid impact prediction is the prediction of the dates and times of asteroidsimpacting Earth, along with the locations and severities of the impacts.\nThe process of impact prediction follows three major steps:\nDiscovery of an asteroid and initial assessment of its orbit which is generally based on a short observation arc of less than 2 weeks.\nCalculating if, when and where the orbit may intersect with Earth at some point in the future.[1]\nIn addition, although not strictly part of the prediction process, once an impact has been predicted, an appropriate response needs to be made.[2]\nMost asteroids are discovered by a camera on a telescope with a wide field of view. Image differencing software compares a recent image with earlier ones of the same part of the sky, detecting objects that have moved, brightened, or appeared. Those systems usually obtain a few observations per night, which can be linked up into a very preliminary orbit determination. This predicts approximate positions over the next few nights, and follow-ups can then be carried out by any telescope powerful enough to see the newly detected object. Orbit intersection calculations are then carried out by two independent systems, one (Sentry) run by NASA and the other (NEODyS) by ESA.\nCurrent systems only detect an arriving object when several factors are just right, mainly the direction of approach relative to the Sun, the weather, and phase of the Moon. The result is a low overall rate of success (around 1%) which is worse the smaller the objects are.[note 1] A few near misses by medium-size asteroids have been predicted years in advance, with a tiny chance of actually striking Earth, and a handful of small actual impactors have successfully been detected hours in advance. All of the latter struck wilderness or ocean, and hurt no one. The majority of impacts are by small, undiscovered objects. They rarely hit a populated area, but can cause widespread damage when they do. Performance is improving in detecting smaller objects as existing systems are upgraded, and new ones come on line, but the blind spot issue which all current systems face around the Sun can only be overcome by a dedicated space based system or by discovering objects on a previous approach to Earth many years before a potential impact.\nIn 1992 a report to NASA recommended a coordinated survey (christened Spaceguard) to discover, verify and provide follow-up observations for Earth-crossing asteroids.[3] This survey was scaled to discover 90% of all objects larger than one kilometer within 25 years. Three years later, a further NASA report recommended search surveys that would discover 60\u201370% of the short-period, near-Earth objects larger than one kilometer within ten years and obtain 90% completeness within five more years.[4]\nIn 1998, NASA formally embraced the goal of finding and cataloging, by 2008, 90% of all near-Earth objects (NEOs) with diameters of 1 km or larger that could represent a collision risk to Earth. The 1 km diameter metric was chosen after considerable study indicated that an impact of an object smaller than 1 km could cause significant local or regional damage but is unlikely to cause a worldwide catastrophe.[3] The impact of an object much larger than 1 km diameter could well result in worldwide damage up to, and potentially including, extinction of the human race. The NASA commitment has resulted in the funding of a number of NEO search efforts, which made considerable progress toward the 90% goal by the target date of 2008 and also produced the first ever successful prediction of an asteroid impact (the 4-meter 2008 TC3 was detected 19 hours before impact). However, the 2009 discovery of several NEOs approximately 2 to 3 kilometers in diameter (e.g. 2009 CR2, 2009 HC82, 2009 KJ, 2009 MS and 2009 OG) demonstrated there were still large objects to be detected.\nThree years later, in 2012, the 40 meter diameter asteroid 367943 Duende was discovered and successfully predicted to be on close but non-colliding approach to Earth again just 11 months later. This was a landmark prediction as the object was only 20 m \u00d7 40 m, and it was closely monitored as a result. On the day of its closest approach and by coincidence, a smaller asteroid was also approaching Earth, unpredicted and undetected, from a direction close to the Sun. Unlike 367943 Duende it was on a collision course and it impacted Earth 16 hours before 367943 Duende passed, becoming the Chelyabinsk meteor. It injured 1,500 people and damaged over 7,000 buildings, raising the profile of the dangers of even small asteroid impacts if they occur over populated areas. The asteroid is estimated to have been 17 m across.\nThe first step in predicting impacts is detecting asteroids and determining their orbits. Finding faint near-Earth objects against the much more numerous background stars is very much a needle in a haystack search. It is achieved by sky surveys that are designed to discover near Earth asteroids. Unlike the majority of telescopes that have a narrow field of view and high magnification, survey telescopes have a wide field of view to scan the entire sky in a reasonable amount of time with enough sensitivity to pick up the faint near-Earth objects they are searching for.\nNEO focused surveys revisit the same area of sky several times in succession. Movement can then be detected using image differencing techniques. Anything that moves from image to image against the background of stars is compared to a catalogue of all known objects, and if it is not already known is reported as a new discovery along with its precise position and the observation time. This then allows other observers to confirm and add to the data about the newly discovered object.[1][14]\nAsteroid surveys can be classified as either cataloging surveys, which use larger telescopes to mostly identify larger asteroids well before they come notably close to Earth, or warning surveys, which use smaller telescopes to mostly look for smaller asteroids within several million kilometers of Earth. Cataloging systems focus on finding larger asteroids years in advance and they scan the sky slowly (of the order of once per month), but deeply. Warning systems focus on scanning the sky relatively quickly (of the order of once per night). They typically cannot detect objects that are as faint as cataloging systems but they will not miss an asteroid that dramatically brightens for just a few days when it passes very close to Earth. Some systems compromise and scan the sky approximately once per week.[citation needed]\nFor larger asteroids (> 100 m to 1 km across), prediction is based on cataloging the asteroid, years to centuries before it could impact. This technique is possible as their size makes them bright enough to be seen from a long distance. Their orbits therefore can be measured and any future impacts predicted long before they are on an impact approach to Earth. This long period of warning is important as an impact from a 1 km object would cause worldwide damage and around a decade of lead time would be needed to deflect it away from Earth. As of 2018, the inventory is nearly complete for the kilometer-size objects (around 900) which would cause global damage, and approximately one third complete for 140 meter objects (around 8500) which would cause major regional damage.[note 2][note 3][14][15][16] The effectiveness of the cataloging is somewhat limited by the fact that some proportion of the objects have been lost since their discovery, due to insufficient observations to accurately determine their orbits.\nSmaller near-Earth objects number into millions and therefore impact Earth much more often, though obviously with much less damage. The vast majority remain undiscovered.[16] They seldom pass close enough to Earth that they become bright enough to observe, and so most can only be observed when within a few million kilometers of Earth. They therefore cannot usually be cataloged well in advance and can only be warned about, a few weeks to days in advance.\nCurrent mechanisms for detecting asteroids on approach rely on ground based telescopes with wide fields of view. Those currently can monitor the sky at most every second night, and therefore miss most of the smaller asteroids which are bright enough to detect for less than two days. Such very small asteroids much more commonly impact Earth than larger ones, but they make little damage. Missing them therefore has limited consequences. Much more importantly, ground-based telescopes are blind to most of the asteroids which impact the day side of the planet and will miss even large ones. These and other problems mean very few impacts are successfully predicted (see \u00a7Effectiveness of the current system and \u00a7Improving impact prediction).[14]\nAsteroids detected by warning systems are much too close to their time of potential impact to deflect them away from Earth, but there is still enough time to mitigate the consequences of the impact by evacuating and otherwise preparing the affected area. Warning systems can also detect asteroids which have been successfully catalogued as existing, but whose orbit was insufficiently well determined to allow a prediction of where they are now.\nThe main NEO focussed surveys are listed below, along with future telescopes that are already funded.\nLocations of the major near Earth asteroid surveys. The addition of Kiso, SST and the Southern ATLAS locations mean the surveys are no longer solely clustered in the north west of the globe\nOriginally all the surveys were clustered together in a relatively small part of the Northern Hemisphere. This meant that around 15% of the sky at extreme Southern declination was never monitored,[17] and that the rest of the Southern sky was observed over a shorter season than the Northern sky. Moreover, as the hours of darkness are fewer in summertime, the lack of a balance of surveys between North and South meant that the sky was scanned less often in the Northern summer. The ATLAS telescopes now operating at the South African Astronomical Observatory and El Sauce observatory in Chile now cover this gap in the south east of the globe.[18][17] Once it is completed, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will improve the existing cover of the southern sky. The 3.5 m Space Surveillance Telescope, which was originally also in the southwest United States, was dismantled and moved to Western Australia in 2017. When completed, this should also improve the global coverage. Construction has been delayed due to the new site being in a cyclone region, but was completed in September 2022.[19][20]\nATLAS, the \"Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\" uses four 0.5-metre telescopes. Two are located on the Hawaiian Islands, at Haleakala and Mauna Loa, one at the South African Astronomical Observatory, and one in Chile.[18][28][22] With a field of view of 30 square degrees each, the telescopes survey the observable sky down to apparent magnitude 19 with 4 exposures every night.[29][30] The survey has been operational with the two Hawaii telescopes since 2017, and in 2018 obtained NASA funding for two additional telescopes sited in the Southern hemisphere. They were expected to take 18 months to build.[31] Their southern locations provide coverage of the 15% of the sky that cannot be observed from Hawaii, and combined with the Northern hemisphere telescopes give non-stop coverage of the equatorial night sky (the South African location is not only in the opposite hemisphere to Hawaii, but also at an opposing longitude).[28] The full ATLAS concept consists of eight of its 50-centimeter diameter f/2 Wright-Schmidt telescopes, spread over the globe for 24h/24h coverage of the full-night-sky.\nIn 1998, the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) took over from Spacewatch in surveying the sky for the University of Arizona. It uses two telescopes, a 1.5 m Cassegrain reflector telescope on the peak of Mount Lemmon (also known as a survey in its own right, the Mount Lemmon Survey), and a 0.7 m Schmidt telescope near Mount Bigelow (both in the Tucson, Arizona area in the south west of the United States). Both sites use identical cameras which provide a field of view of 5 square degrees on the 1.5 m telescope and 19 square degrees on the Catalina Schmidt. The Cassegrain reflector telescope takes three to four weeks to survey the entire sky, detecting objects fainter than apparent magnitude 21.5. The 0.7 m telescope takes a week to complete a survey of the sky, detecting objects fainter than apparent magnitude 19.[32] This combination of telescopes, one slow and one medium, has so far detected more near Earth Objects than any other single survey. This shows the need for a combination of different types of telescopes.\nCSS used to include a telescope in the Southern Hemisphere, the Siding Spring Survey. However operations ended in 2013 after funding was discontinued.[33]\nThe Kiso Observatory uses a 1.05m Schmidt telescope on Mt. Ontake near Tokyo in Japan.[34] In late 2019 the Kiso Observatory added a new instrument to the telescope, \"Tomo-e Gozen\", designed to detect fast moving and rapidly changing objects. It has a wide field of view (20 square degrees) and scans the sky in just 2 hours, far faster than any other survey as of 2021.[35][36] This puts it squarely in the warning survey category. In order to scan the sky so quickly, the camera captures 2 frames per second, which means the sensitivity is lower than other metre class telescopes (which have much longer exposure times), giving a limiting magnitude of just 18.[37][38] However, despite not being able to see dimmer objects which are detectable by other surveys, the ability to scan the entire sky several times per night allows it to spot fast moving asteroids that other surveys miss. It has discovered a significant number of near-Earth asteroids as a result (for example see List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2021).\nThe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a wide-field survey reflecting telescope with an 8.4 meter primary mirror, currently under construction on Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile. It will survey the entire available sky around every three nights. Science operations are due to begin in 2022.[39] Scanning the sky relatively fast but also being able to detect objects down to apparent magnitude 27, it should be good at detecting nearby fast moving objects as well as excellent for larger slower objects that are currently further away.\nA planned space-based 0.5m infrared telescope designed to survey the Solar System for potentially hazardous asteroids.[40] The telescope will use a passive cooling system, and so unlike its predecessor NEOWISE, it will not suffer from a performance degradation due to running out of coolant. It does still have a limited mission duration however as it needs to use propellant for orbital station keeping in order to maintain its position at SEL1. From here, the mission will search for asteroids hidden from Earth based satellites by the Sun's glare. It is planned for launch in 2026.[23][24]\nThe Near Earth Object Survey TELescope (NEOSTEL) is an ESA funded project, starting with an initial prototype currently under construction. The telescope is of a new \"fly-eye\" design that combines a single reflector with multiple sets of optics and CCDs, giving a very wide field of view (around 45 square degrees). When complete it will have the widest field of view of any telescope and will be able to survey the majority of the visible sky in a single night. If the initial prototype is successful, three more telescopes are planned for installation around the globe. Because of the novel design, the size of the primary mirror is not directly comparable to more conventional telescopes, but is equivalent to a conventional 1\u2013metre telescope.[41][42]\nThe telescope itself should be complete by end of 2019, and installation on Mount Mufara, Sicily should be complete in 2020 but was pushed back to 2022.[25][41][43]\nViewed from space by WISE using a thermal camera, asteroid 2010 AB78 appears redder than the background stars as it emits most of its light at longer infrared wavelengths. In visible light it is very faint and difficult to see.\nThe Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer is a 0.4 m infrared-wavelengthspace telescope launched in December 2009,[44][45][46] and placed in hibernation in February 2011.[47] It was re-activated in 2013 specifically to search for near-Earth objects under the NEOWISE mission.[48] By this stage, the spacecraft's cryogenic coolant had been depleted and so only two of the spacecraft's four sensors could be used. Whilst this has still led to new discoveries of asteroids not previously seen from ground-based telescopes, the productivity has dropped significantly. In its peak year when all four sensors were operational, WISE made 2.28 million asteroid observations. In recent years, with no cryogen, NEOWISE typically makes approximately 0.15 million asteroid observations annually.[21] The next generation of infrared space telescopes has been designed so that they do not need cryogenic cooling.[49]\nThe Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) is a 3.5 m telescope that detects, tracks, and can discern small, obscure objects, in deep space with a wide field of view system. The SST mount uses an advanced servo-control technology, that makes it one of the quickest and most agile telescopes of its size.[54][55] It has a field of view of 6 square degrees and can scan the visible sky in 6 clear nights down to apparent magnitude 20.5. Its primary mission is tracking orbital debris. This task is similar to that of spotting near-Earth asteroids and so it is capable of both.[56]\nSpacewatch was an early sky survey focussed on finding near Earth asteroids, founded in 1980. It was the first to use CCDimage sensors to search for them, and the first to develop software to detect moving objects automatically in real-time. This led to a huge increase in productivity. Before 1990 a few hundred observations were made each year. After automation, annual productivity jumped by a factor of 100 leading to tens of thousands of observations per year. This paved the way for the surveys we have today.[27]\nAlthough the survey is still in operation, in 1998 it was superseded by Catalina Sky Survey. Since then it has focused on following up on discoveries by other surveys, rather than making new discoveries itself. In particular it aims to prevent high priority PHOs from being lost after their discovery. The survey telescopes are 1.8 m and 0.9 m. The two follow-up telescopes are 2.3 m and 4 m.[27]\nThe orbits of kilometre class NEAs are generally well known as there are usually many follow-up observations. Large numbers of smaller NEAs however have highly uncertain orbits due to insufficient follow-up after discovery. Many have been lost. [62]\nOnce a new asteroid has been discovered and reported, other observers can confirm the finding and help define the orbit of the newly discovered object. The International Astronomical UnionMinor Planet Center (MPC) acts as the global clearing house for information on asteroid orbits. It publishes lists of new discoveries that need verifying and still have uncertain orbits, and it collects the resulting follow-up observations from around the world. Unlike the initial discovery, which typically requires unusual and expensive wide-field telescopes, ordinary telescopes can be used to confirm the object as its position is now approximately known. There are far more of these around the globe, and even a well equipped amateur astronomer can contribute valuable follow-up observations of moderately bright asteroids. For example, the Great Shefford Observatory in the back garden of amateur Peter Birtwhistle typically submits thousands of observations to the Minor Planet Center every year.[63][21] Nonetheless, some surveys (for example CSS and Spacewatch) have their own dedicated follow-up telescopes.[27]\nFollow-up observations are important because once a sky survey has reported a discovery it may not return to observe the object again for days or weeks. By this time it may be too faint for it to detect, and in danger of becoming a lost asteroid. The more observations and the longer the observation arc, the greater the accuracy of the orbit model. This is important for two reasons:\nfor imminent impacts it helps to make a better prediction of where the impact will occur and whether there is any danger of hitting a populated area.\nfor asteroids that will miss Earth this time round, the more accurate the orbit model is, the further into the future its position can be predicted. This allows recovery of the asteroid on its subsequent approaches, and impacts to be predicted years in advance.[14]\nAssessing the size of the asteroid is important for predicting the severity of the impact, and therefore the actions that need to be taken (if any). With just observations of reflected visible light by a conventional telescope, the object could be anything from 50% to 200% of the estimated diameter, and therefore anything from one-eighth to eight times the estimated volume and mass.[64] Because of this, one key follow-up observation is to measure the asteroid in the thermal infrared spectrum (long-wavelength infrared), using an infrared telescope. The amount of thermal radiation given off by an asteroid together with the amount of reflected visible light allows a much more accurate assessment of its size than just how bright it appears in the visible spectrum. Jointly using thermal infrared and visible measurements, a thermal model of the asteroid can estimate its size to within about 10% of the true size.\nOne example of such a follow-up observation was for 3671 Dionysus by UKIRT, the world's largest infrared telescope at the time (1997).[65] A second example was the 2013 ESA Herschel Space Observatory follow-up observations of 99942 Apophis, which showed it was 20% larger and 75% more massive than previously estimated.[66] However such follow-ups are rare. The size estimates of most near-Earth asteroids are based on visible light only.[67]\nIf the object was discovered by an infrared survey telescope initially, then an accurate size estimate will become available with visible light follow-up, and infrared follow-up will not be needed. However none of the ground-based survey telescopes listed above operate at thermal infrared wavelengths. The NEOWISE satellite had two thermal infrared sensors but they stopped working when the cryogen ran out. There are therefore currently no active thermal infrared sky surveys which are focused on discovering near-Earth objects. There are plans for a new space based thermal infrared survey telescope, Near-Earth Object Surveillance Mission, due to launch in 2025.\nThe minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) between an asteroid and the Earth is the distance between the closest points of their orbits. This first check is a coarse measure that does not allow an impact prediction to be made, but is based solely on the orbit parameters and gives an initial measure of how close to Earth the asteroid could come. If the MOID is large then the two objects never come near each other. In this case, unless the orbit of the asteroid is perturbed so that the MOID is reduced at some point in the future, it will never impact Earth and can be ignored. However, if the MOID is small then it is necessary to carry out more detailed calculations to determine if an impact will happen in the future. Asteroids with a MOID of less than 0.05 AU and an absolute magnitude brighter than 22 are categorized as a potentially hazardous asteroid.[68]\nOrbit and positions of 2018 LA and Earth, 30 days before impact. The diagram shows how orbit data can be used to predict impacts well in advance. This particular asteroid's orbit was only known a few hours before impact. The diagram was made later.\nOnce the initial orbit is known, the potential positions can be forecast years into the future and compared to the future position of Earth. If the distance between the asteroid and the centre of the Earth is less than Earth radius then a potential impact is predicted. To take account of the uncertainties in the orbit of the asteroid, many future projections are made (simulations) with slightly different parameters within the range of the uncertainty. This allows a percentage chance of impact to be estimated. For example, if 1,000 simulations are carried out and 73 result in an impact, then the prediction would be a 7.3% chance of impact.[69]\nNEODyS (Near Earth Objects Dynamic Site) is a European Space Agency service that provides information on near Earth objects. It is based on a continually and (almost) automatically maintained database of near Earth asteroid orbits. The site provides a number of services to the NEO community. The main service is an impact monitoring system (CLOMON2) of all near-Earth asteroids covering a period until the year 2100.[70]\nThe NEODyS website includes a Risk Page where all NEOs with probabilities of hitting the Earth greater than 10\u221211 from now until 2100 are shown in a risk list. In the table of the risk list the NEOs are divided into:\n\"observable\", objects which are presently observable and which critically need a follow-up in order to improve their orbit\n\"possible recovery\", objects which are not visible at present, but which are possible to recover in the near future\n\"lost\", objects which have an absolute magnitude (H) brighter than 25 but which are virtually lost, their orbit being too uncertain; and\n\"small\", objects with an absolute magnitude fainter than 25; even when those are \"lost\", they are considered too small to result in heavy damage on the ground (though the Chelyabinsk meteor would have been fainter than this).\nEach object has its own impactor table (IT) which shows many parameters useful to determine the risk assessment.[71]\nNASA's Sentry System continually scans the MPC catalog of known asteroids, analyzing their orbits for any possible future impacts.[1] Like ESA's NEODyS, it gives a list of possible future impacts, along with the probability of each. It uses a slightly different algorithm to NEODyS, and so provides a useful cross-check and corroboration.\nCurrently, no impacts are predicted (the single highest probability impact currently listed is ~7 m asteroid 2010 RF12, which is due to pass Earth in September 2095 with only a 10% predicted chance of impacting; its size is also small enough that any damage from an impact would be minimal).[72][73]\nThe ellipses in the diagram on the right show the predicted position of an example asteroid at closest Earth approach. At first, with only a few asteroid observations, the error ellipse is very large and includes the Earth. The impact prediction is small because the Earth cover a small fraction or the error ellipse. (Often times the error ellipse extends for tens if not hundreds of millions of km.) Further observations shrink the error ellipse. If it still includes the Earth, this raises the predicted impact probability, since the Earth now covers a larger fraction of the error region. Finally, yet more observations (often radar observations, or discovery of a previous sighting of the same asteroid on much older archival images) shrink the ellipse, usually revealing that the Earth is outside the smaller error region and the impact probability is then near zero.[74] In rare cases, the Earth remains in the ever shrinking error ellipse and the impact probability then approaches one.\nFor asteroids that are actually on track to hit Earth, the predicted probability of impact never stops increasing as more observations are made. This initially very similar pattern makes it difficult to quickly differentiate between asteroids which will be millions of kilometres from Earth and those which will actually hit it. This in turn makes it difficult to decide when to raise an alarm as gaining more certainty takes time, which reduces the time available to react to a predicted impact. However raising the alarm too soon has the danger of causing a false alarm and creating a Boy Who Cried Wolf effect if the asteroid in fact misses Earth. NASA will raise an alert if an asteroid has a better than 1% chance of impacting.\nIn December 2004 when Apophis was estimated to have a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth on 13 April 2029, the uncertainty region for this asteroid had shrunk to 82,818 km.[75]\nOnce an impact has been predicted the potential severity needs to be assessed, and a response plan formed.[2] Depending on the time to impact and the predicted severity this may be as simple as giving a warning to citizens. For example, although unpredicted, the 2013\nimpact at Chelyabinsk was spotted through the window by teacher Yulia Karbysheva. She thought it prudent to take precautionary measures by ordering her students to stay away from the room's windows and to perform a duck and cover maneuver. The teacher, who remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the blast arrived and window glass severed a tendon in one of her arms and left thigh, but none of her students, whom she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered lacerations.[76][77] If the impact had been predicted and a warning had been given to the entire population, similar simple precautionary actions could have vastly reduced the number of injuries. Children who were in other classes were injured.[78]\nIf a more severe impact is predicted, the response may require evacuation of the area, or with sufficient lead time available, an avoidance mission to repel the asteroid. According to expert testimony in the United States Congress in 2013, NASA would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched which was demonstrated by kinetically deflecting a minor planet moon, non-hazardous NEO Asteroid called Dimorphos with the help of the DART spacecraft.[79] Following a ten-month journey to the Didymos system, the impactor collided with Dimorphos on 26 September 2022 at a speed of around 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kilometres per hour).[80][81] The collision successfully decreased Dimorphos's orbital period around Didymos by 32\u00b12 minutes.[82][83][84][85]\nOne problem with assessing effectiveness this way is that the sensitivity of infrasound sensors extends to small asteroids, which generally do very little damage. The missed asteroids do tend to be small, and missing small asteroids is relatively unimportant. By contrast, missing a large day-side impacting asteroid is highly problematic, with the unpredicted mid-size Chelyabinsk meteor providing a mild real-life example. In order to assess the effectiveness for detecting the (rare) larger asteroids which do matter, a different approach is needed.\nThat effectiveness for larger asteroid can be assessed by looking at warning times for asteroids which did not impact Earth but came close. The below diagram for asteroids which came closer than the Moon shows how far in advance of closest approach they were first detected. Unlike actual asteroid impacts, where infrasound sensors provide ground truth, it is impossible to know for sure how many close approaches were undetected. The below chart therefore and by construction excludes any asteroids which went completely undetected. Of the asteroids that were detected, the diagram shows that about half were not detected until after they had passed Earth. If they had been on an impact trajectory, they would have been undetected before impact, primarily because they approached from a direction close to the Sun. This includes larger asteroids such as 2018 AH, which approached from a direction close to the Sun and wasn't detected until 2 days after it had passed. It is estimated to be around 100 times more massive than the Chelyabinsk meteor.\nIt is worth noting that the number of detections is increasing as more survey sites come on line (for example ATLAS in 2016 and ZTF in 2018), but that approximately half of the detections are invariably made after the asteroid passes the Earth. The below charts visualise the warning times of the close approaches listed in the above bargraph, by the size of the asteroid instead of by the year they occurred in. The sizes of the charts show the relative sizes of the asteroids to scale. This is based the absolute magnitude of each asteroid, an approximate measure of size based on brightness. For comparison, the approximate size of a person is also shown.\nAs can be seen, the ability to predict larger asteroids has significantly improved since the early years of the 21st century, with some now being catalogued (predicted more than 1 year in advance), or having usable early warning times (greater than a week).\nOne final statistic which casts some light on the effectiveness of the current system is the average warning time for an asteroid impact. Based on the few successfully predicted asteroid impacts, the average time between initial detection and impact is currently around 4 hours. There is however some delay between the initial observation of the asteroid, data submission, and the follow-up observations and calculations which lead to an impact prediction being made.\nIn addition to the already-funded telescopes mentioned above, two separate approaches have been suggested by NASA to improve impact prediction. Both approaches focus on the first step in impact prediction (discovering near-Earth asteroids) as this is the largest weakness in the current system. The first approach uses more powerful ground-based telescopes similar to the LSST.[87] Being ground-based, such telescopes will still only observe part of the sky around Earth. In particular, all ground-based telescopes have a large blind spot for any asteroids coming from the direction of the Sun.[14] In addition, they are affected by weather conditions, airglow and the phase of the Moon.\nGround based telescopes can only detect objects approaching on the night-side of the planet, away from the Sun. Roughly half of impacts occur on the day-side of the planet.\nTo get around all of these issues, the second approach suggested is the use of space-based telescopes which can observe a much larger region of the sky around Earth. Although they still cannot point directly towards the Sun, they do not have the problem of blue sky to overcome and so can detect asteroids much closer in the sky to the Sun than ground-based telescopes.[73] Unaffected by weather or airglow they can also operate 24 hours per day all year round. Finally, telescopes in space have the advantage of being able to use infrared sensors without the interference of the Earth's atmosphere. These sensors are better for detecting asteroids than optical sensors, and although there are some ground based infrared telescopes such as UKIRT,[88] they are not designed for detecting asteroids. Space-based telescopes are more expensive, however, and tend to have a shorter lifespan. Therefore, Earth-based and space-based technologies complement each other to an extent.[14] Although the majority of the IR spectrum is blocked by Earth's atmosphere, the very useful thermal (long-wavelength infrared) frequency band is not blocked (see gap at 10 \u03bcm in the diagram below). This allows for the possibility of ground based thermal imaging surveys designed for detecting near earth asteroids, though none are currently planned.\nThere is a further issue that even telescopes in Earth orbit do not overcome (unless they operate in the thermal infrared spectrum). This is the issue of illumination. Asteroids go through phases similar to the lunar phases. Even though a telescope in orbit may have an unobstructed view of an object that is close in the sky to the Sun, it will still be looking at the dark side of the object. This is because the Sun is shining primarily on the side facing away from the Earth, as is the case with the Moon when it is in a new moon phase. Because of this opposition effect, objects are far less bright in these phases than when fully illuminated, which makes them difficult to detect (see chart and diagram below).\nThis problem can be solved by the use of thermal infrared surveys (either ground based or space based). Ordinary telescopes depend on observing light reflected from the Sun, which is why the opposition effect occurs. Telescopes which detect thermal infrared light depend only on the temperature of the object. Its thermal glow can be detected from any angle, and is particularly useful for differentiating asteroids from the background stars, which have a different thermal signature.[64]\nThis problem can also be solved without using thermal infrared, by positioning a space telescope away from Earth, closer to the Sun. The telescope can then look back towards Earth from the same direction as the Sun, and any asteroids closer to Earth than the telescope will then be in opposition, and much better illuminated. There is a point between the Earth and Sun where the gravities of the two bodies are perfectly in balance, called the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point (SEL1). It is approximately 1.6 million kilometres (1 million miles) from Earth, about four times as far away as the Moon, and is ideally suited for placing such a space telescope.[14] One problem with this position is Earth glare. Looking outward from SEL1, Earth itself is at full brightness, which prevents a telescope situated there from seeing that area of sky. Fortunately, this is the same area of sky that ground-based telescopes are best at spotting asteroids in, so the two complement each other.\nAnother possible position for a space telescope would be even closer to the Sun, for example in a Venus-like orbit. This would give a wider view of Earth orbit, but at a greater distance. Unlike a telescope at the SEL1 Lagrange point, it would not stay in sync with Earth but would orbit the Sun at a similar rate to Venus. Because of this, it would not often be in a position to provide any warning of asteroids shortly before impact, but it would be in a good position to catalog objects before they are on final approach, especially those which primarily orbit closer to the Sun.[14] One issue with being as close to the Sun as Venus is that the craft may be too warm to use infrared wavelengths. A second issue would be communications. As the telescope will be a long way from Earth for most of the year (and even behind the Sun at some points) communication would often be slow and at times impossible, without expensive improvements to the Deep Space Network.[14]\nIn 2017, NASA proposed a number of alternative solutions to detect 90% of near-Earth objects of size 140 m or larger over the next few decades. As the detection sensitivity drops off with size but does not cut off, this will also improve the detection rates for the smaller objects which impact Earth much more often. Several of the proposals use a combination of an improved ground-based telescope and a space-based telescope positioned at the SEL1 Lagrange point.[14][2][73] A number of large ground based telescopes are already in the late stages of construction (see above). A space based mission situated at SEL1, NEOSM has now also been funded. It is planned for launch in 2026.[23][24]\nBelow is the list of all near-Earth objects which have or may have impacted the Earth and which were predicted beforehand.[89] This list would also include any objects identified as having greater than 50% chance of impacting in the future, but no such future impacts are predicted at this time.[90] As asteroid detection ability increases it is expected that prediction will become more successful in the future.\nIn addition to these objects, the meteoroid CNEOS20200918 was found in 2022 in archival ATLAS data, imaged 10 minutes before its 2020/09/18 impact. Although it technically could have been discovered before impact, it was only noticed in retrospect.[97]\n^Smaller asteroids which are only bright enough to observe briefly. Larger asteroids are visible for long enough to overcome the more temporary conditions that prevent observation such as bad weather or a bright moon in the sky, however close proximity to the Sun in the sky can prevent all sizes of asteroid from being discovered. This is particularly true for Aten asteroids, which spend the majority of their time closer to the Sun than Earth and are therefore difficult to detect without a space based system orbiting inside of Earth's orbit.\n^Incompleteness refers to the fraction of undiscovered asteroids, not the amount of time remaining to achieve completeness. The asteroids remaining to be discovered are the ones which are hardest to find.\n^The exact percentage of objects discovered is uncertain but is estimated using statistical techniques. 2018 estimates for objects at least 1 km in size put the figure somewhere between 89% and 99%, with an expected value of 94%. This matches the figure from a 2017 NASA report which was estimated independently using a different technique\n^Because of daylight telescopes cannot see the portion of the sky around the Sun and because the Earth is in the way can only see so far North and South of the latitude that they are positioned at. The time given is the time it takes for a survey to complete coverage of the part of the sky that it can see from where it is located, assuming good weather.\n^The limiting magnitude indicates how bright an object needs to be before the telescope can detect it, larger numbers are better (fainter objects can be detected).\n^Around the time of the full Moon, the Moon is so bright that it lights up the atmosphere making faint objects impossible to see for several days per month\n^This refers to the opposition effect as seen from Earth, the fact that objects outside of the narrow cone centered on Earth are much fainter and harder to spot without using thermal infrared (see diagram above)\n^Use of thermal infrared allows objects to be seen at all angles as detection doesn't depend on reflected sunlight. It also allows an accurate size estimate of the object which is important for predicting the severity of an impact.\n^Although many IR wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere, there is a window from 8 \u03bcm to 14 \u03bcm that allows detection of IR at useful wavelengths such as 12 \u03bcm. A 12 \u03bcm sensor was used by WISE to detect asteroids during its space based mission. Although some ground based IR surveys exist which can detect 12 \u03bcm (such as UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey), none are designed to detect moving objects such as asteroids.\n^ abTelescopes in Earth orbit are affected to an extent by the glow of the moon, but not in the same way as ground based telescopes where the light from the moon is scattered across the sky by the atmosphere\n^ abTelescopes at SEL1 are primarily affected by the glare of the Earth rather than the Moon, but not in the same way as ground based telescopes where the light from the moon is scattered across the sky by the atmosphere\n^Telescopes in a Venus-like orbit have no problems with atmosphere but being closer to the Sun, may be too warm to effectively use thermal infrared sensors. This problem could be overcome by using cryogenic coolant but this increases cost and gives the telescope a limited lifespan due to the coolant running out\n^The listed warning period is the time between the first observation and the impact. The time between the first impact prediction and the impact is necessarily shorter, and some of the impacts were actually predicted after they occurred.\n^There are two main strategies for predicting asteroid impacts with Earth, the Cataloging Strategy and the Warning Strategy. The Cataloging Strategy aims to detect all near Earth objects which could at some point in the future impact Earth. Accurate orbit predictions are made which can then anticipate any future impact years in advance. The larger and therefore most dangerous objects are amenable to this strategy as they can be observed from a sufficient distance. The more numerous but less dangerous smaller objects cannot so easily be detected this way as they are fainter and cannot be seen until they are relatively close by. The Warning Strategy aims to detect impactors months or days before they reach Earth (NASA 2017 Update on Enhancing the Search and Characterization of Near Earth Objects)\n^2014 AA exploded over the mid-Atlantic, far from the nearest infrasound detectors. Although some detections were made, reliable figures are not known\n^an object with the temporary designation A106fgF was discovered by the ATLAS survey and only has an observation arc of 39 minutes. Using the observation arc, it was only possible to estimate a 9% chance of impact between the South Atlantic, southern Africa, the Indian ocean, Indonesia, or the Pacific ocean. Whether the asteroid did impact Earth or not remains uncertain due to its small size and since much of the potential impact area is at sea or sparsely populated.\n^2018 LA was estimated to have an 82% chance of impacting Earth somewhere between the central Pacific ocean and Africa (Impact pathArchived 13 June 2018 at the Wayback Machine). Several reports from South Africa and Botswana confirmed that it did indeed impact in South-central Africa and additional observations that came in after the impact post-predicted a consistent impact location.\n^\"Why we have Asteroid \"Scares\"\".

        "question": "Which country is currently at the top rank at the FIBA Men's World Ranking?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Men%27s_World_Ranking#:~:text=Points-,1,%C2%A0United%20States,-786.6",
        "context": "\nThe FIBA Men's World Ranking are FIBA's rankings of national basketball teams. FIBA ranks both men's and women's national teams for both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all mixed-sex competitions.\nOnly FIBA tournaments consisting of full five-a-side teams are used in calculations for the rankings. Other tournaments, such as regional championships, invitationals, three-on-three half-court basketball, and friendlies are not included.[2]\nOn October 11, 2017, FIBA radically changed its ranking system for men's national teams when Nike became FIBA's strategic partner. The changes saw the ranking system switching from the previous competition-based system to a game-based system.[3][4] Every game played by a national team within the last eight years in the World Cup, Olympics, continental championships, and qualifiers for these events is included in the calculations.[5] In addition to the qualifying rounds, results of the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries are also included.[citation needed]\nUntil the 2016 Olympic Games, the Olympics and the men's world championship gave 5 points each toward the ranking. Since the new FIBA ranking system was launched, these two tournaments had their score devalued to 2.5 points for playing in a World championship, and 2 points for playing in an Olympic game since 2017.\nAccording to the new system, both tournaments will not grant a differential score with respect to other tournaments of national teams, as opposed to the past where there was no difference in points in the ranking for being world champion or Olympic champion, but if there was much difference until 2016 in FIBA ranking points between these two tournaments and the rest of the competitions in FIBA, such as the continental tournaments. For women, FIBA will maintain the score of 5 points for playing an Olympic or world championship game.[citation needed][incomprehensible]\nEach game in a ranking tournament is initially valued at 1,000 \"basis points\", divided between the two teams as follows:[5]\nVictory margin\nPoints to winner\nPoints to loser\nLess than 10 points\n600\n400\n10\u201319 points\n700\n300\n20 or more points\n800\n200\nForfeit\n800\n0\nThe basis points are adjusted based on the site of the game, with FIBA calling this adjustment \"home\" and \"away\" points. During the finals of ranking tournaments, only games played by a host team in its own country count as \"home\" games; all others are treated as neutral-site games. Adjustments are:[5]\nHome game: \u221270 points\nNeutral site: no adjustment\nAway game: +70 points\nThe basis points are also adjusted to reflect the strength of the opponent. FIBA determines what it calls \"opposition ranking points\" by the following formula:[5]\nIn a new feature, a \"time decay\" factor has been introduced into the calculations. More-recent games carry the greatest weight, steadily declining until falling out of the calculations after 8 years:[5]\nFIBA uses a weighted arithmetic mean (with a minimum divisor which is not published[6]) to determine the statistical weight of each tournament. Each event is assigned a point weight that is based partly on how competitive the tournament is and partly on which national teams are participating.[2]\nFrom 2017 forward, FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania members compete for a single regional championship under the FIBA Asia banner. Results from the 2010\u20132016 period, during which FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania held separate championships, will continue to figure into the rankings (until 2025 via \"time decay\").[5]\nIn a new feature, FIBA also weights game results by the \"competition stage\".[5]\nStage\nWeight\nPre-qualifier\n0.25\nQualifier\n0.5\nFinal tournament\n1.0\nAdditionally, FIBA has added a \"round weighting\" to the system, giving each game in a final tournament (World Cup, Olympics, or continental championship) a weighting based on the round in which it takes place. Qualifying matches for these tournaments implicitly carry a round weighting of 1.0.[5]\nRound\nWeight\nGroup stage\n1.0\nRound of 16\n1.25\nQuarterfinals\n1.5\nSemifinals\n1.75\nFinal\n2.0\nIf a competition does not have a round of 16 and/or a quarterfinal round, the results from the rounds that are held are scaled according to the number of rounds, with the group stage remaining at a 1.0 weighting and the competition final remaining at 2.0.\nFIBA still uses the competition-based system to determine its women's rankings. As noted above, this system was also used to determine men's rankings prior to 2017. FIBA introduced a game-based ranking procedure similar to that currently used for men's rankings in the indeterminate future in November 2019.[7]",

        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia#:~:text=Currency,)%20(EUR)",
        "context": "\nThe oldest preserved record of the Croatian ethnonym's native variation *x\u044arvat\u044a is of the variable stem, attested in the Ba\u0161ka tablet in style zv\u044an\u044amir\u044a kral\u044a xr\u044avat\u044ask\u044a (\"Zvonimir, Croatian king\"),[19] while the Latin variation Croatorum is archaeologically confirmed on a church inscription found in Bija\u0107i near Trogir dated to the end of the 8th or early 9th century.[20] The presumably oldest stone inscription with fully preserved ethnonym is the 9th-century Branimir inscription found near Benkovac, where Duke Branimir is styled Dux Cruatorvm, likely dated between 879 and 892, during his rule.[21] The Latin term Chroatorum is attributed to a charter of Duke Trpimir I of Croatia, dated to 852 in a 1568 copy of a lost original, but it is not certain if the original was indeed older than the Branimir inscription.[22][23]\nDuring the 5th century, the last de jure Western Roman EmperorJulius Nepos ruled a small realm from the palace after fleeing Italy in 475.[32] The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the late 6th and first half of the 7th century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands, and mountains. The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.[33]\nAccording to Constantine VII the Christianisation of Croats began in the 7th century, but the claim is disputed, and generally, Christianisation is associated with the 9th century.[45] It is assumed that initially encompassed only the elite and related people.[46] The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav,[47] or his successor Trpimir I.[48] The native Croatian royal dynasty was founded by duke Trpimir I in the mid 9th century, who defeated the Byzantine and Bulgarian forces.[49]\nFollowing the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories in 1538. The military territories became known as the Croatian Military Frontier and were under direct Habsburg control. Ottoman advances in Croatia continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak, the first decisive Ottoman defeat, when borders stabilised.[55] During the Great Turkish War (1683\u20131698), Slavonia was regained, but western Bosnia, which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control.[55] The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. Dalmatia, the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars.[56]\nThe political situation deteriorated further as Radi\u0107 was assassinated in the National Assembly in 1928, leading to King Alexander I to establish a dictatorship in January 1929.[70] The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitary constitution.[71] The HSS, now led by Vladko Ma\u010dek, continued to advocate federalisation, resulting in the Cvetkovi\u0107\u2013Ma\u010dek Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia. The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban.[72]\nA resistance movement emerged. On 22 June 1941,[83] the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak, the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Europe.[84] That sparked the beginning of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, a communist, multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito.[85] In ethnic terms, Croats were the second-largest contributors to the Partisan movement after Serbs.[86] In per capita terms, Croats contributed proportionately to their population within Yugoslavia.[87] By May 1944 (according to Tito), Croats made up 30% of the Partisan's ethnic composition, despite making up 22% of the population.[86] The movement grew fast, and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943, the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.[88]\nCardinal Aloysius Stepinac with the Croatian communist leader Vladimir Bakari\u0107 at the celebration of May Day, shortly before Stepinac was arrested and convicted by the communists, he became a symbol of resistance to the communist regime in Yugoslavia.\nBased on the studies on wartime and post-war casualties by demographer Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107 and statistician Bogoljub Ko\u010dovi\u0107, a total of 295,000 people from the territory (not including territories ceded from Italy after the war) died, which amounted to 7.3% of the population,[93] among whom were 125\u2013137,000 Serbs, 118\u2013124,000 Croats, 16\u201317,000 Jews, and 15,000 Roma.[94][95] In addition, from areas joined to Croatia after the war, a total of 32,000 people died, among whom 16,000 were Italians and 15,000 were Croats.[96] Approximately 200,000 Croats from the entirety of Yugoslavia (including Croatia) and abroad were killed in total throughout the war and its immediate aftermath, approximately 5.4% of the population.[97][98]\nThe declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and redistribution of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership.[100] Still, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.[101]\nBy the end of 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia's control to about two-thirds of its territory.[111][112] Serb paramilitary groups then began a campaign of killing, terror, and expulsion of the Croats in the rebel territories, killing thousands[113] of Croat civilians and expelling or displacing as many as 400,000 Croats and other non-Serbs from their homes.[114] Serbs living in Croatian towns, especially those near the front lines, were subjected to various forms of discrimination.[115] Croatian Serbs in Eastern and Western Slavonia and parts of the Krajina were forced to flee or were expelled by Croatian forces, though on a restricted scale and in lesser numbers.[116] The Croatian Government publicly deplored these practices and sought to stop them, indicating that they were not a part of the Government's policy. [117]\nAfter the end of the war, Croatia faced the challenges of post-war reconstruction, the return of refugees, establishing democracy, protecting human rights, and general social and economic development.\nThe 2000s period is characterized by democratization, economic growth, structural and social reforms, and problems such as unemployment, corruption, and the inefficiency of public administration.[129] In November 2000 and March 2001, the Parliament amended the Constitution, first adopted on 22 December 1990, changing its bicameral structure back into its historic unicameral form and reducing presidential powers.[130][131]\nA wave of anti-government protests in 2011 reflected a general dissatisfaction with the current political and economic situation. The protests brought together diverse political persuasions in response to recent government corruption scandals and called for early elections. On 28 October 2011 MPs voted to dissolve Parliament and the protests gradually subsided. President Ivo Josipovi\u0107 agreed to a dissolution of Sabor on Monday, 31 October and scheduled new elections for Sunday 4 December 2011.[141][142][143]\nCroatia was affected by the 2015 European migrant crisis when Hungary's closure of borders with Serbia pushed over 700,000 refugees and migrants to pass through Croatia on their way to other EU countries.[147]\nOn 25 January 2022, the OECD Council decided to open accession negotiations with Croatia. Throughout the accession process, Croatia is to implement numerous reforms that will advance all spheres of activity \u2013 from public services and the justice system to education, transport, finance, health, and trade. In line with the OECD Accession Roadmap from June 2022, Croatia will undergo technical reviews by 25 OECD committees and is so far progressing at a faster pace than expected. Full membership is expected in 2025 and is the last big foreign policy goal Croatia still has to achieve.[148][149][150][151]\nOn 1 January 2023 Croatia adopted the euro as its official currency, replacing the kuna, and became the 20th Eurozone member. On the same day, Croatia became the 27th member of the border-free Schengen Area, thus marking its full EU integration.[152]\nThe territory covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles), consisting of 56,414 square kilometres (21,782 square miles) of land and 128 square kilometres (49 square miles) of water. It is the world's 127th largest country.[156] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point of the Dinara peak at 1,831 metres (6,007 feet) near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south[156] to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border. Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets varying in size, 48 of which permanently inhabited. The largest islands are Cres and Krk,[156] each of them having an area of around 405 square kilometres (156 square miles).\nThe hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east which is part of the Pannonian Basin are traversed by major rivers such as Danube, Drava, Kupa, and the Sava. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Vojvodina. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt, and hydropower.[156]Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps.[157] Croatia hosts deep caves, 49 of which are deeper than 250 m (820.21 ft), 14 deeper than 500 m (1,640.42 ft) and three deeper than 1,000 m (3,280.84 ft). Croatia's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes, a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue.[158]\nMost of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Mean monthly temperature ranges between \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) in January and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in July. The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar featuring a snowy, forested climate at elevations above 1,200 metres (3,900 feet). The warmest areas are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by Mediterranean climate, as the sea moderates temperature highs. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in continental areas.\nBora is a dry, cold wind which blows from the mainland out to sea, whose gusts can reach hurricane strength, particularly in the channel below Velebit. On the picture Bora in the town of Senj.\nThe lowest temperature of \u221235.5 \u00b0C (\u221231.9 \u00b0F) was recorded on 3 February 1919 in \u010cakovec, and the highest temperature of 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F) was recorded on 4 August 1981 in Plo\u010de.[159][160]\nMean annual precipitation ranges between 600 millimetres (24 inches) and 3,500 millimetres (140 inches) depending on geographic region and climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Bi\u0161evo, Lastovo, Svetac, Vis) and the eastern parts of Slavonia. However, in the latter case, rain occurs mostly during the growing season. The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski Kotar.[159]\nPrevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area, prevailing winds are determined by local features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as the cool northeasterly bura or less frequently as the warm southerly jugo. The sunniest parts are the outer islands, Hvar and Kor\u010dula, where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general, and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year.[161]\nThe karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, some of which are the habitat of the only known aquatic cave vertebrate\u2014the olm. Forests are significantly present, as they cover 2,490,000 hectares (6,200,000 acres) representing 44% of Croatian land area. Other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.[165]\nCroatia hosts 37,000 known plant and animal species, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.[165] More than a thousand species are endemic, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.[165] The most serious threat is habitat loss and degradation. A further problem is presented by invasive alien species, especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae. Croatia had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.92/10, ranking it 113th of 172 countries.[167]\nInvasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect benthic habitat. Indigenous cultivated plant strains and domesticated animal breeds are numerous. They include five breeds of horses, five of cattle, eight of sheep, two of pigs, and one poultry. Indigenous breeds include nine that are endangered or critically endangered.[165] Croatia has 444 protected areas, encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight national parks, two strict reserves, and ten nature parks. The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in the preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network.[165]\nThe Republic of Croatia is a unitary, constitutional state using a parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are legislative, executive, and judiciary powers.[168]\nThe president of the republic (Croatian: Predsjednik Republike) is the head of state, directly elected to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to two terms. In addition to serving as commander in chief of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the parliament and has some influence on foreign policy.[168]\nThe Government is headed by the prime minister, who has four deputy prime ministers and 16 ministers in charge of particular sectors.[169] As the executive branch, it is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, enforcing the laws, and guiding foreign and internal policies. The Government is seated at Banski dvori in Zagreb.[168]\nCroatia has a civil law legal system in which law arises primarily from written statutes, with judges serving as implementers and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems. Croatian law is divided into two principal areas\u2014private and public law. Before EU accession negotiations were completed, Croatian legislation had been fully harmonised with the Community acquis.[172]\nThe main national courts are the Constitutional Court, which oversees violations of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court, which is the highest court of appeal. Administrative, Commercial, County, Misdemeanor, and Municipal courts handle cases in their respective domains.[173] Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are in the first instance decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials.[174] The State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.[175]\nAs of 2019, the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration employed 1,381[needs update] personnel and expended 765.295 million kunas (\u20ac101.17 million).[180] Stated aims of Croatian foreign policy include enhancing relations with neighbouring countries, developing international co-operation and promotion of the Croatian economy and Croatia itself.[181]\nCroatia is a member of the European Union. As of 2021, Croatia had unsolved border issues with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia.[182] Croatia is a member of NATO.[183][184] On 1 January 2023, Croatia simultaneously joined both the Schengen Area and the Eurozone,[185] having previously joined the ERM II on 10 July 2020.\nThe Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) consist of the Air Force, Army, and Navy branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the General Staff, which reports to the defence minister, who in turn reports to the president. According to the constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In case of immediate threat during wartime, he issues orders directly to the General Staff.[189]\nFollowing the 1991\u201395 war, defence spending and CAF size began a constant decline. As of 2019[update], military spending was an estimated 1.68% of the country's GDP, 67th globally.[190] In 2005 the budget fell below the NATO-required 2% of GDP, down from the record high of 11.1% in 1994.[191] Traditionally relying on conscripts, the CAF went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing, restructuring and professionalisation in the years before accession to NATO in April 2009. According to a presidential decree issued in 2006, the CAF employed around 18,100 active duty military personnel, 3,000 civilians and 2,000 voluntary conscripts between 18 and 30 years old in peacetime.[189]\nCompulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008.[156] Until 2008 military service was obligatory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine months. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for eight months of civilian service.[192]\nAs of May 2019[update], the Croatian military had 72 members stationed in foreign countries as part of United Nations-led international peacekeeping forces.[193] As of 2019[update], 323 troops served the NATO-led ISAF force in Afghanistan. Another 156 served with KFOR in Kosovo.[194][195]\nCroatia has a military-industrial sector that exported around 493 million kunas (\u20ac65,176 million) worth of military equipment in 2020.[196] Croatian-made weapons and vehicles used by CAF include the standard sidearm HS2000 manufactured by HS Produkt and the M-84D battle tank designed by the \u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107 factory. Uniforms and helmets worn by CAF soldiers are locally produced and marketed to other countries.[197]\nCroatia was first divided into counties in the Middle Ages.[198] The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, and Istria. The traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced oblasts and banovinas respectively.[199]\nCommunist-ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions. In 1918, the Transleithanian part was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar, Gospi\u0107, Ogulin, Osijek, Po\u017eega, Vara\u017edin, Vukovar, and Zagreb.[200][201]\nAs of 1992, Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the dual authority and legal status of a county and a city. County borders changed in some instances, last revised in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities.[202]Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level considers the entire country in a single unit; three NUTS 2 regions come below that. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia, and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses the counties along the Adriatic coast. Northwest Croatia includes Koprivnica-Kri\u017eevci, Krapina-Zagorje, Me\u0111imurje, Vara\u017edin, the city of Zagreb, and Zagreb counties and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas\u2014Bjelovar-Bilogora, Brod-Posavina, Karlovac, Osijek-Baranja, Po\u017eega-Slavonia, Sisak-Moslavina, Virovitica-Podravina, and Vukovar-Syrmia counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS local administrative unit divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to cities and municipalities.[203]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(June 2022)\nOn January 1, 2023, Croatia replaced the kuna as its national currency and adopted the euro, on the same day Croatia became part of the Schengen zone.\nCroatia's economy qualifies as high-income.[204]International Monetary Fund data projected that Croatian nominal GDP reached $67,84 billion, or $17.398 per capita for 2021[205] while purchasing power parity GDP was $132,88 billion, or $32.942 per capita.[206] According to Eurostat, Croatian GDP per capita in PPS stood at 65% of the EU average in 2019.[207] Real GDP growth in 2022 was 6.2 per cent.[208] The average net salary of a Croatian worker in October 2019 was 6,496 HRK per month (roughly 873 EUR), and the average gross salary was 8,813 HRK per month (roughly 1,185 EUR).[209] As of July 2019[update], the unemployment rate dropped to 7.2% from 9.6% in December 2018. The number of unemployed persons was 106.703. The unemployment rate between 1996 and 2018 averaged 17.38%, reaching an all-time high of 23.60% in January 2002 and a record low of 8.40% in September 2018.[210] In 2017, economic output was dominated by the service sector \u2014 accounting for 70.1% of GDP \u2014 followed by the industrial sector with 26.2% and agriculture accounting for 3.7%.[211]\nAccording to 2017 data, 1.9% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, 27.3% by industry and 70.8% in services.[211] Shipbuilding, food processing, pharmaceuticals, information technology, biochemical, and timber industry dominate the industrial sector. In 2018, Croatian exports were valued at 108 billion kunas (\u20ac14.61 billion) with 176 billion kunas (\u20ac23.82 billion) worth of imports. Croatia's largest trading partner was the rest of the European Union, led by Germany, Italy, and Slovenia.[212]\nAs a result of the war, economic infrastructure sustained massive damage, particularly the tourism industry. From 1989 to 1993, the GDP fell 40.5%. The Croatian state still controls significant economic sectors, with government expenditures accounting for 40% of GDP.[213] A particular concern is a backlogged judiciary system, with inefficient public administration and corruption, upending land ownership. In the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, published by Transparency International, the country ranked 57th.[214] At the end of June 2020, the national debt stood at 85.3% of GDP.[215]\nTourism dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20% of GDP. Tourism income for 2019 was estimated to be \u20ac10.5 billion.[216] Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy, increasing retail business, and increasing seasonal employment. The industry is counted as an export business because foreign visitor spending significantly reduces the country's trade imbalance.[217] The tourist industry has rapidly grown, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers since independence, attracting more than 11 million visitors each year.[218] Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy, Poland and Croatia itself provide the most visitors.[219] Tourist stays averaged 4.7 days in 2019.[220]\nMuch of the tourist industry is concentrated along the coast. Opatija was the first holiday resort. It first became popular in the middle of the 19th century. By the 1890s, it had become one of the largest European health resorts.[221] Resorts sprang up along the coast and islands, offering services catering to mass tourism and various niche markets. The most significant are nautical tourism, supported by marinas with more than 16 thousand berths, cultural tourism relying on the appeal of medieval coastal cities and cultural events taking place during the summer. Inland areas offer agrotourism, mountain resorts, and spas. Zagreb is a significant destination, rivalling major coastal cities and resorts.[222]\nCroatia ranked as the 23rd-most popular tourist destination in the world according to the World Tourism Organization in 2019.[225] About 15% of these visitors,[which?][quantify] or over one million per year, participate in naturism, for which Croatia is famous. It was the first European country to develop commercial naturist resorts.[226] In 2023, luggage storage company Bounce gave Croatia the highest solo travel index in the world (7.58),[227] while a joint Pinterest and Zola wedding trends report from 2023 put Croatia among the most popular honeymoon destinations.[228]\nThe motorway network was largely built in the late 1990s and the 2000s (decade). As of December 2020, Croatia had completed 1,313.8 kilometres (816.4 miles) of motorways, connecting Zagreb to other regions and following various European routes and four Pan-European corridors.[229][230][231] The busiest motorways are the A1, connecting Zagreb to Split and the A3, passing east to west through northwest Croatia and Slavonia.[232]\nA widespread network of state roads in Croatia acts as motorway feeder roads while connecting major settlements. The high quality and safety levels of the Croatian motorway network were tested and confirmed by EuroTAP and EuroTest programmes.[233][234]\nCroatia has an extensive rail network spanning 2,722 kilometres (1,691 miles), including 984 kilometres (611 miles) of electrified railways and 254 kilometres (158 miles) of double track railways.[235] The most significant railways in Croatia are within the Pan-European transport corridors Vb and X connecting Rijeka to Budapest and Ljubljana to Belgrade, both via Zagreb.[229]Croatian Railways operates all rail services.[236]\nThe construction of 2.4-kilometre-long Pelje\u0161ac Bridge, the biggest infrastructure project in Croatia connects the two halves of Dubrovnik-Neretva County and shortens the route from the West to the Pelje\u0161ac peninsula and the islands of Kor\u010dula and Lastovo by more than 32 km. The construction of the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge started in July 2018 after Croatian road operator Hrvatske ceste (HC) signed a 2.08 billion kuna deal for the works with a Chinese consortium led by China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). The project is co-financed by the European Union with 357 million euro. The construction was completed in July 2022.[237]\nThe busiest cargo seaport is the Port of Rijeka. The busiest passenger ports are Split and Zadar.[241][242] Many minor ports serve ferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities with ferry lines to several cities in Italy.[243] The largest river port is Vukovar, located on the Danube, representing the nation's outlet to the Pan-European transport corridor VII.[229][244]\n610 kilometres (380 miles) of crude oil pipelines serve Croatia, connecting the Rijeka oil terminal with refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, and several transhipment terminals. The system has a capacity of 20 million tonnes per year.[245] The natural gas transportation system comprises 2,113 kilometres (1,313 miles) of trunk and regional pipelines, and more than 300 associated structures, connecting production rigs, the Okoli natural gas storage facility, 27 end-users and 37 distribution systems.[246] Croatia also plays an important role in regional energy security. The floating liquefied natural gas import terminal off Krk island LNG Hrvatska commenced operations on January 1, 2021, positioning Croatia as a regional energy leader and contributing to diversification of Europe's energy supply.[16]\nCroatian energy production covers 85% of nationwide natural gas and 19% of oil demand. In 2008, 47.6% of Croatia's primary energy production involved natural gas (47.7%), hydropower (25.4%), crude oil (18.0%), fuelwood (8.4%), and other renewable energy sources (0.5%). In 2009, net total electrical power production reached 12,725 GWh, while it imported 28.5% of its electric power energy needs.[155]\nThe total fertility rate of 1.41 children per mother, is one of the lowest in the world, far below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 6.18 children rate in 1885.[211][250] Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate since 1991.[155] Croatia subsequently has one of the world's oldest populations, with an average age of 43.3 years.[251] The population rose steadily from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million, with the exceptions of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following the world wars.[155] The natural growth rate is negative[156] with the demographic transition completed in the 1970s.[252] In recent years, the Croatian government has been pressured to increase permit quotas for foreign workers, reaching an all-time high of 68.100 in 2019.[253] In accordance with its immigration policy, Croatia is trying to entice emigrants to return.[254] From 2008 to 2018, Croatia's population dropped by 10%.[255]\nThe population decrease was greater a result of war for independence. The war displaced large numbers of the population and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly occupied areas, more than 400,000 Croats were either removed from their homes by Serb forces or fled the violence.[256] During the war's final days, about 150\u2013200,000 Serbs fled before the arrival of Croatian forces during Operation Storm.[122][257] After the war, the number of displaced persons fell to about 250,000. The Croatian government cared for displaced persons via the social security system and the Office of Displaced Persons and Refugees.[258] Most of the territories abandoned during the war were settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly from north-western Bosnia, while some displaced people returned to their homes.[259][260]\nCroatian Constitution, Article 41</ref> According to the 2011 census, 91.36% of Croatians identify as Christian; of these, Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 86.28% of the population, after which follows Eastern Orthodoxy (4.44%), Protestantism (0.34%), and other Christians (0.30%).The largest religion after Christianity is Islam (1.47%). 4.57% of the population describe themselves as non-religious.[264] In the Eurostat Eurobarometer Poll of 2010, 69% of the population responded that \"they believe there is a God\".[265] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 70% answered yes to the question \"Is religion an important part of your daily life?\"[266] However, only 24% of the population attends religious services regularly.[267]\nA 2011 survey revealed that 78% of Croats claim knowledge of at least one foreign language.[271] According to a 2005 EC survey, 49% of Croats speak English as the second language, 34% speak German, 14% speak Italian, and 10% speak French. Russian is spoken by 4%, and 2% of Croats speak Spanish. However several large municipalities support minority languages. A majority of Slovenes (59%) have some knowledge of Croatian.[272] The country is a part of various language-based international associations, most notably the European Union Language Association.[273]\nUniversity of Zagreb is the largest Croatian university and the oldest university in the area covering Central Europe south of Vienna and all of Southeastern Europe (1669).\nLiteracy in Croatia stands at 99.2 per cent.[274] Primary education in Croatia starts at the age of six or seven and consists of eight grades. In 2007 a law was passed to increase free, noncompulsory education until 18 years of age. Compulsory education consists of eight grades of elementary school.\nSecondary education is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools. As of 2019, there are 2,103 elementary schools and 738 schools providing various forms of secondary education.[275] Primary and secondary education are also available in languages of recognised minorities in Croatia, where classes are held in Czech, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Serbian languages.[276]\nThere are 137 elementary and secondary level music and art schools, as well as 120 schools for disabled children and youth and 74 schools for adults.[277] Nationwide leaving exams (Croatian: dr\u017eavna matura) were introduced for secondary education students in the school year 2009\u20132010. It comprises three compulsory subjects (Croatian language, mathematics, and a foreign language) and optional subjects and is a prerequisite for university education.[278]\nCroatia has eight public universities and two private universities.[279] The University of Zadar, the first university in Croatia, was founded in 1396 and remained active until 1807, when other institutions of higher education took over until the foundation of the renewed University of Zadar in 2002.[280] The University of Zagreb, founded in 1669, is the oldest continuously operating university in Southeast Europe.[281] There are also 15 polytechnics, of which two are private, and 30 higher education institutions, of which 27 are private.[279] In total, there are 55 institutions of higher education in Croatia, attended by more than 157 thousand students.[277]\nThere are 205 companies, government or education system institutions and non-profit organisations in Croatia pursuing scientific research and development of technology. Combined, they spent more than 3 billion kuna (\u20ac400 million) and employed 10,191 full-time research staff in 2008.[155] Among the scientific institutes operating in Croatia, the largest is the Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute in Zagreb.[282] The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb is a learned society promoting language, culture, arts and science from its inception in 1866.[283] Croatia was ranked 44th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[284]\nThe European Investment Bank provided digital infrastructure and equipment to around 150 primary and secondary schools in Croatia. Twenty of these schools got specialised assistance in the form of gear, software, and services to help them integrate the teaching and administrative operations.[285][286]\nCroatia has a universal health care system, whose roots can be traced back to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen.[287] The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2017, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 22.0 billion kuna (\u20ac3.0 billion).[288] Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending.[289] In 2017, Croatia spent around 6.6% of its GDP on healthcare.[290]\nIn 2020, Croatia ranked 41st in the world in life expectancy with 76.0 years for men and 82.0 years for women, and it had a low infant mortality rate of 3.4 per 1,000 live births.[291]\nThere are hundreds of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 75 hospitals, and 13 clinics with 23,049 beds. The hospitals and clinics care for more than 700 thousand patients per year and employ 6,642 medical doctors, including 4,773 specialists. There is total of 69,841 health workers. There are 119 emergency units in health centres, responding to more than a million calls.[citation needed] The principal cause of death in 2016 was cardiovascular disease at 39.7% for men and 50.1% for women, followed by tumours, at 32.5% for men and 23.4% for women.[292] In 2016 it was estimated that 37.0% of Croatians are smokers.[293] According to 2016 data, 24.40% of the Croatian adult population is obese.[294]\nBecause of its geographical position, Croatia represents a blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroads of influences from western culture and the east since the schism between the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire, and also from Central Europe and Mediterranean culture.[307] The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th century proved crucial to the emancipation of Croatians and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to many historical figures.[62]\nIn 2019, Croatia had 95 professional theatres, 30 professional children's theatres, and 51 amateur theatres visited by more than 2.27 million viewers per year. Professional theatres employ 1,195 artists. There are 42 professional orchestras, ensembles, and choirs, attracting an annual attendance of 297 thousand. There are 75 cinemas with 166 screens and attendance of 5.026 million.[312]\nCroatia has 222 museums, visited by more than 2.71 million people in 2016. Furthermore, there are 1,768 libraries, containing 26.8 million volumes, and 19 state archives.[313] The book publishing market is dominated by several major publishers and the industry's centrepiece event\u2014Interliber exhibition held annually at Zagreb Fair.[314]\nArchitecture in Croatia reflects influences of bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influence is visible in public spaces and buildings in the north and the central regions, architecture found along coasts of Dalmatia and Istria exhibits Venetian influence.[315] Squares named after culture heroes, parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of Croatian towns and cities, especially where large scale Baroque urban planning took place, for instance in Osijek (Tvr\u0111a), Vara\u017edin, and Karlovac.[316][317] The subsequent influence of the Art Nouveau was reflected in contemporary architecture.[318] The architecture is the Mediterranean with a Venetian and Renaissance influence in major coastal urban areas exemplified in works of Giorgio da Sebenico and Nicolas of Florence such as the Cathedral of St. James in \u0160ibenik. The oldest preserved examples of Croatian architecture are the 9th-century churches, with the largest and the most representative among them being Church of St. Donatus in Zadar.[319][320]\nBesides the architecture encompassing the oldest artworks, there is a history of artists in Croatia reaching the Middle Ages. In that period the stone portal of the Trogir Cathedral was made by Radovan, representing the most important monument of Romanesque sculpture from Medieval Croatia. The Renaissance had the greatest impact on the Adriatic Sea coast since the remainder was embroiled in the Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War. With the waning of the Ottoman Empire, art flourished during the Baroque and Rococo. The 19th and 20th centuries brought affirmation of numerous Croatian artisans, helped by several patrons of the arts such as bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer.[321] Croatian artists of the period achieving renown were Vlaho Bukovac, Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, and Ivan Generali\u0107.[319][322]\nCroatian music varies from classical operas to modern-day rock. Vatroslav Lisinski created the country's first opera, Love and Malice, in 1846. Ivan Zajc composed more than a thousand pieces of music, including masses and oratorios. Pianist Ivo Pogoreli\u0107 has performed across the world.[322]\nIn Croatia, the Constitution guarantees the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech.[326] Croatia ranked 64th in the 2019 Press Freedom Index report compiled by Reporters Without Borders which noted that journalists who investigate corruption, organised crime or war crimes face challenges and that the Government was trying to influence the public broadcaster HRT's editorial policies.[327] In its 2019 Freedom in the World report, the Freedom House classified freedoms of press and speech in Croatia as generally free from political interference and manipulation, noting that journalists still face threats and occasional attacks.[328] The state-owned news agency HINA runs a wire service in Croatian and English on politics, economics, society, and culture.[329]\nAs of January 2021[update], there are thirteen nationwide free-to-air DVB-T television channels, with Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) operating four, RTL Televizija three, and Nova TV operating two channels, and the Croatian Olympic Committee, Kapital Net d.o.o., and Author d.o.o. companies operate the remaining three.[331] Also, there are 21 regional or local DVB-T television channels.[332] The HRT is also broadcasting a satellite TV channel.[333] In 2020, there were 155 radio stations and 27 TV stations in Croatia.[334][335] Cable television and IPTV networks are gaining ground. Cable television already serves 450 thousand people, around 10% of the total population of the country.[336][337]\nCroatian traditional cuisine varies from one region to another. Dalmatia and Istria have culinary influences of Italian and other Mediterranean cuisines which prominently feature various seafood, cooked vegetables and pasta, and condiments such as olive oil and garlic. Austrian, Hungarian, Turkish, and Balkan culinary styles influenced continental cuisine. In that area, meats, freshwater fish, and vegetable dishes are predominant.[348]\nThere are two distinct wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental in the northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, produces premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines are similar to those in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines are the norm.[348] Annual production of wine exceeds 140 million litres.[155] Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive beer production and consumption started.[349] The annual consumption of beer in 2020 was 78.7 litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.[350]\nThere are 11 restaurants in Croatia with a Michelin star and 89 restaurants bearing some of the Michelin's marks.[351]\n^Wilkes, John (1995).

        "context": "\nThe seven non-eurozone members of the EU are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden. They continue to use their own national currencies, although all but Denmark are obliged to join once they meet the euro convergence criteria.[9] Among non-EU member states, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City have formal agreements with the EU to use the euro as their official currency and issue their own coins.[10][11][12]\nIn addition, Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro unilaterally.[13] These six countries, however, have no representation in any eurozone institution.[14]\nSince the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the eurozone has established and used provisions for granting emergency loans to member states in return for enacting economic reforms.[citation needed] The eurozone has also enacted some limited fiscal integration; for example, in peer review of each other's national budgets. The issue is political and in a state of flux in terms of what further provisions will be agreed for eurozone change. No eurozone member state has left, and there are no provisions to do so or to be expelled.[15]\nIn 1998, eleven member states of the European Union had met the euro convergence criteria, and the eurozone came into existence with the official launch of the euro (alongside national currencies) on 1 January 1999 in those countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece qualified in 2000 and was admitted on 1 January 2001.\nThese twelve founding members introduced physical euro banknotes and euro coins on 1 January 2002. After a short transition period, they took out of circulation and rendered invalid their pre-euro national coins and notes.\nBetween 2007 and 2023, eight new states have acceded: Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\nThe euro is also used in countries outside the EU. Four states (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) have signed formal agreements with the EU to use the euro and issue their own coins.[28][29] Nevertheless, they are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB and do not have a seat in the ECB or Euro Group.\nAkrotiri and Dhekelia (located on the island of Cyprus) belong to the United Kingdom, but there are agreements between the UK and Cyprus[citation needed] and between UK and EU[citation needed] about their partial integration with Cyprus and partial adoption of Cypriot law, including the usage of euro in Akrotiri and Dhekelia.[citation needed]\nKosovo and Montenegro officially adopted the euro as their sole currency without an agreement and, therefore, have no issuing rights.[29] These states are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB. However, sometimes the term eurozone is applied to all territories that have adopted the euro as their sole currency.[30][31][32] Further unilateral adoption of the euro (euroisation), by both non-euro EU and non-EU members, is opposed by the ECB and EU.[33]\nThe chart below provides a full summary of all applying exchange-rate regimes for EU members, since the birth, on 13 March 1979, of the European Monetary System with its Exchange Rate Mechanism and the related new common currency ECU. On 1 January 1999, the euro replaced the ECU 1:1 at the exchange rate markets. During 1979\u20131999, the D-Mark functioned as a de facto anchor for the ECU, meaning there was only a minor difference between pegging a currency against the ECU and pegging it against the D-Mark.\nThe eurozone was born with its first 11 member states on 1 January 1999. The first enlargement of the eurozone, to Greece, took place on 1 January 2001, one year before the euro physically entered into circulation. The next enlargements were to states which joined the EU in 2004, and then joined the eurozone on 1 January of the year noted: Slovenia in 2007, Cyprus in 2008, Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015. Croatia, which acceded to the EU in 2013, adopted the euro in 2023.\nAll new EU members joining the bloc after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 are obliged to adopt the euro under the terms of their accession treaties. However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria which need first to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion, which requires having been an ERM-member for a minimum of two years without the presence of \"severe tensions\" for the currency exchange rate.\nIn September 2011, a diplomatic source close to the euro adoption preparation talks with the seven remaining new member states who had yet to adopt the euro at that time (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania), claimed that the monetary union (eurozone) they had thought they were going to join upon their signing of the accession treaty may very well end up being a very different union, entailing a much closer fiscal, economic, and political convergence than originally anticipated. This changed legal status of the eurozone could potentially cause them to conclude that the conditions for their promise to join were no longer valid, which \"could force them to stage new referendums\" on euro adoption.[34]\nBefore joining the eurozone, a state must spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II). As of January 2023[update], the Danish central bank and the Bulgarian central bank participate in ERM II.\nDenmark obtained a special opt-out in the original Maastricht Treaty, and thus is legally exempt from joining the eurozone unless its government decides otherwise, either by parliamentary vote or referendum. The United Kingdom likewise had an opt-out prior to withdrawing from the EU in 2020.\nThe remaining six countries are obliged to adopt the euro in future, although the EU has so far not tried to enforce any time plan. They should join as soon as they fulfill the convergence criteria, which include being part of ERM II for two years. Sweden, which joined the EU in 1995 after the Maastricht Treaty was signed, is required to join the eurozone. However, the Swedish people turned down euro adoption in a 2003 referendum and since then the country has intentionally avoided fulfilling the adoption requirements by not joining ERM II, which is voluntary.[35][36] Bulgaria joined ERM II on 10 July 2020.[37]\nInterest in joining the eurozone increased in Denmark, and initially in Poland, as a result of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. In Iceland, there was an increase in interest in joining the European Union, a pre-condition for adopting the euro.[38] However, by 2010 the debt crisis in the eurozone caused interest from Poland, as well as the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden to cool.[39]\nIn the opinion of journalist Leigh Phillips and Locke Lord's Charles Proctor,[40][41] there is no provision in any European Union treaty for an exit from the eurozone. In fact, they argued, the Treaties make it clear that the process of monetary union was intended to be \"irreversible\" and \"irrevocable\".[41] However, in 2009, a European Central Bank legal study argued that, while voluntary withdrawal is legally not possible, expulsion remains \"conceivable\".[42] Although an explicit provision for an exit option does not exist, many experts and politicians in Europe have suggested an option to leave the eurozone should be included in the relevant treaties.[43]\nOn the issue of leaving the eurozone, the European Commission has stated that \"[t]he irrevocability of membership in the euro area is an integral part of the Treaty framework and the Commission, as a guardian of the EU Treaties, intends to fully respect [that irrevocability].\"[44] It added that it \"does not intend to propose [any] amendment\" to the relevant Treaties, the current status being \"the best way going forward to increase the resilience of euro area Member States to potential economic and financial crises.[44] The European Central Bank, responding to a question by a Member of the European Parliament, has stated that an exit is not allowed under the Treaties.[45]\nLikewise there is no provision for a state to be expelled from the euro.[46] Some, however, including the Dutch government, favour the creation of an expulsion provision for the case whereby a heavily indebted state in the eurozone refuses to comply with an EU economic reform policy.[47]\nIn a Texas law journal, University of Texas at Austin law professor Jens Dammann has argued that even now EU law contains an implicit right for member states to leave the eurozone if they no longer meet the criteria that they had to meet in order to join it.[48] Furthermore, he has suggested that, under narrow circumstances, the European Union can expel member states from the eurozone.[49]\nThe monetary policy of all countries in the eurozone is managed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem which comprises the ECB and the central banks of the EU states who have joined the eurozone. Countries outside the eurozone are not represented in these institutions. Whereas all EU member states are part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), non EU member states have no say in all three institutions, even those with monetary agreements such as Monaco. The ECB is entitled to authorise the design and printing of euro banknotes and the volume of euro coins minted, and its president is currently Christine Lagarde.\nThe eurozone is represented politically by its finance ministers, known collectively as the Eurogroup, and is presided over by a president, currently Paschal Donohoe. The finance ministers of the EU member states that use the euro meet a day before a meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) of the Council of the European Union. The Group is not an official Council formation but when the full EcoFin council votes on matters only affecting the eurozone, only Euro Group members are permitted to vote on it.[50][51][52]\nSince the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the Euro Group has met irregularly not as finance ministers, but as heads of state and government (like the European Council). It is in this forum, the Euro summit, that many eurozone reforms have been decided upon. In 2011, former French PresidentNicolas Sarkozy pushed for these summits to become regular and twice a year in order for it to be a 'true economic government'.[citation needed]\nIn April 2008 in Brussels, future European CommissionPresidentJean-Claude Juncker suggested that the eurozone should be represented at the IMF as a bloc, rather than each member state separately: \"It is absurd for those 15 countries not to agree to have a single representation at the IMF. It makes us look absolutely ridiculous. We are regarded as buffoons on the international scene\".[53] In 2017 Juncker stated that he aims to have this agreed by the end of his mandate in 2019.[54] However, Finance CommissionerJoaqu\u00edn Almunia stated that before there is common representation, a common political agenda should be agreed upon.[53]\nLeading EU figures including the commission and national governments have proposed a variety of reforms to the eurozone's architecture; notably the creation of a Finance Minister, a larger eurozone budget, and reform of the current bailout mechanisms into either a \"European Monetary Fund\" or a eurozone Treasury. While many have similar themes, details vary greatly.[55][56][57][58]\nThe 20 largest economies in the world including eurozone as a single entity, by nominal GDP (2020) at their peak level of GDP in billions US$. The values for EU members that are not also eurozone members are listed both separately and as part of the EU.[60]\nInterest rates for the eurozone, set by the ECB since 1999.[62] Levels are in percentages per annum. Between June 2000 and October 2008, the main refinancing operations were variable rate tenders, as opposed to fixed rate tenders. The figures indicated in the table from 2000 to 2008 refer to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.[4]\nComparison of government surplus/deficit (2001\u20132012) of eurozone, United States and United Kingdom\nThe primary means for fiscal coordination within the EU lies in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which are written for every member state, but with particular reference to the 20 current members of the eurozone. These guidelines are not binding, but are intended to represent policy coordination among the EU member states, so as to take into account the linked structures of their economies.\nFor their mutual assurance and stability of the currency, members of the eurozone have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, which sets agreed limits on deficits and national debt, with associated sanctions for deviation. The Pact originally set a limit of 3% of GDP for the yearly deficit of all eurozone member states; with fines for any state which exceeded this amount. In 2005, Portugal, Germany, and France had all exceeded this amount, but the Council of Ministers had not voted to fine those states. Subsequently, reforms were adopted to provide more flexibility and ensure that the deficit criteria took into account the economic conditions of the member states, and additional factors.\nOlivier Blanchard suggests that a fiscal union in the eurozone can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the eurozone peripheral countries. But he adds that the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the eurozone peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, they are forced to adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.[71]\nThe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 prompted a number of reforms in the eurozone. One was a U-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy that led to the creation of a specific fund to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However, the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the EU treaties. Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a permanent treaty basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article 136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.\nIn February 2016, the UK secured further confirmation that countries that do not use the Euro would not be required to contribute to bailouts for eurozone countries.[72]\nIn June 2010, a broad agreement was finally reached on a controversial proposal for member states to peer review each other's budgets prior to their presentation to national parliaments. Although showing the entire budget to each other was opposed by Germany, Sweden and the UK, each government would present to their peers and the Commission their estimates for growth, inflation, revenue and expenditure levels six months before they go to national parliaments. If a country was to run a deficit, they would have to justify it to the rest of the EU while countries with a debt more than 60% of GDP would face greater scrutiny.[73]\nThe plans would apply to all EU members, not just the eurozone, and have to be approved by EU leaders along with proposals for states to face sanctions before they reach the 3% limit in the Stability and Growth Pact. Poland has criticised the idea of withholding regional funding for those who break the deficit limits, as that would only impact the poorer states.[73] In June 2010 France agreed to back Germany's plan for suspending the voting rights of members who breach the rules.[74] In March 2011 was initiated a new reform of the Stability and Growth Pact aiming at straightening the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the deficit or the debt rules.[75][76]\nIn 1997, Arnulf Baring expressed concern that the European Monetary Union would make Germans the most hated people in Europe. Baring suspected the possibility that the people in Mediterranean countries would regard Germans and the currency bloc as economic policemen.[77]\nIn 2001, James Tobin thought that the euro project would not succeed without making drastic changes to European institutions, pointing out the difference between the US and the eurozone.[78] Concerning monetary policies, the system of Federal Reserve banks in the US aims at both growth and reducing unemployment, while the ECB tends to give its first priority to price stability under the Bundesbank's supervision. As the price level of the currency bloc is kept low, the unemployment level of the region has become higher than that of the US since 1982.[78] Concerning fiscal policies, 12% of the US federal budget is used for transfers to states and local governments. The US government does not impose restrictions on state budget policies, whereas the Treaty of Maastricht requires each eurozone member country to keep its budget deficit below 3% of its GDP.[78]\nThe eurozone has also been criticized for deepening inequality in Europe, particularly between the richest and poorest countries.[83] According to a study by Bertelsmann Stiftung, countries such as Austria and the Netherlands benefited significantly from the common currency, while southern and eastern European members of the eurozone gained very little,[84] and some countries are considered to have suffered adverse effects from adopting the euro.[85] In an article for the Politico, Joseph Stiglitz argues: \"The result for the eurozone has been slower growth, and especially for the weaker countries within it. The euro was supposed to usher in greater prosperity, which in turn would lead to renewed commitment to European integration. It has done just the opposite \u2014 increasing divisions within the EU, especially between creditor and debtor countries.\"[85] Matthias Matthijs believes that the euro resulted in a \"winner-take-all\" economy, as national income differences between eurozone members have widened further.[86] He argues that countries such as Austria and Germany have gained from the eurozone at the expense of southern countries like Italy and Spain.[86]\nBy adopting the euro and abandoning their national currencies, eurozone countries gave up their ability to conduct independent monetary policy; as such, monetary policies used to combat recession, such as monetary stimulus or currency devaluation, are no longer available.[86] During the European debt crisis, several eurozone countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus) were unable to repay their debt without third-party intervention by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.[87] In order to grant the bailout, the ECB and the IMF forced the affected countries to adopt strict austerity measures.[86] The European bailouts were largely about shifting exposure from banks onto European taxpayers,[88][89][90] and exacerbated issues such as high unemployment and poverty.[91][92]\nIn 2019, a study from the Centre for European Policy concluded that while some countries had gained from adopting the euro, several countries were poorer than they would have been had they not adopted it, with France and Italy being particularly affected.[93][94] The publication prompted a large number of reactions, pushing its authors to put out a statement clarifying some points.[95] In 2020, a study from the University of Bonn reached a different conclusion: the adoption of the euro made \u201csome mild losers (France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal) and a clear winner (Ireland)\u201d.[96] Both studies used the synthetic control method to estimate what might have happened if the euro hadn't been adopted.\n^Includes the population of Croatia, even though it was not a eurozone member in 2021.\n^The ECB announced on 22 December 1998 that, between 4 and 21 January 1999, there would be a narrow corridor of 50 basis points interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility in order to help the transition to the ECB's interest regime.",

        "context": "\nThe Schengen Area has a population of more than 423 million people and an area of 4,368,693 square kilometres (1,686,762 sq mi).[3] About 1.7 million people commute to work across an internal European border each day, and in some regions these people constitute up to a third of the workforce. In 2015, there were 1.3 billion crossings of Schengen borders in total. 57 million crossings were due to transport of goods by road, with a value of \u20ac2.8 trillion.[4][5][6] The decrease in the cost of trade due to Schengen varies from 0.42% to 1.59% depending on geography, trade partners, and other factors. Countries outside of the Schengen Area also benefit.[7] States in the Schengen Area have strengthened border controls with non-Schengen countries.[8]\nThe Schengen Agreement was signed on 14 June 1985 by five of the ten EC member states[9] in the town of Schengen, Luxembourg. The Schengen Area was established separately from the European Communities, when consensus could not be reached among all EC member states on the abolition of border controls.\nThe Agreement was supplemented in 1990 by the Schengen Convention, which proposed the abolition of internal border controls and a common visa policy.[10] The Agreements and the rules adopted under them were entirely separate from the EC structures, and led to the creation of the Schengen Area on 26 March 1995.[11]\nAs more EU member states signed the Schengen Agreement, consensus was reached on absorbing it into the procedures of the EU. The Agreement and its related conventions were incorporated into the mainstream of European Union law by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997, which came into effect in 1999. A consequence of the Agreement being part of European law is that any amendment or regulation is made within its processes, in which the non-EU members are not participants.\nThe UK, the Crown Dependencies, and the Republic of Ireland have operated a Common Travel Area (CTA) since 1923 (with passport-free travel and freedom of movement with each other), but the UK would not abolish border controls with any other countries and therefore opted out of the Agreement. While not signing the Schengen Treaty, the Republic of Ireland has always looked more favourably on joining, but has not done so in order to maintain the CTA and its open border with Northern Ireland.[12]\nThe common visa policy allows nationals of certain countries to enter the Schengen Area via air, land or sea without a visa for stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Nationals of certain other countries are required to have a visa either upon arrival or in transit.\nSome Atlantic islands such as the Canary islands are also in the Schengen Area\nThis is a clickable map\nThe Schengen Area consists of 27 countries, including four which are not members of the European Union (EU). Two of the non-EU members \u2013 Iceland and Norway \u2013 are part of the Nordic Passport Union and are officially classified as states associated with the Schengen activities of the EU.[13]Switzerland was allowed to participate in the same manner in 2008. Croatia joined the Schengen Area on 1 January 2023. De facto, the Schengen Area also includes four European micro-states \u2013 Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City \u2013 that maintain open or semi-open borders with other Schengen member countries.[14] Although Andorra\u2019s agreements with France and Spain make it effectively part of Schengen,[15] this can be avoided by requesting entry and exit stamps at the border.[16]\nOne EU member state \u2013 Ireland \u2013 negotiated opt-outs from Schengen and continues to operate border controls with other EU member states, while at the same time being part of the open-border Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom (a former EU member) and the Crown Dependencies. The remaining three EU member states \u2013 Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania \u2013 are obliged by their Treaties of Accession to join the Schengen Area eventually. However, before fully implementing the Schengen rules, each state must have its preparedness assessed in four areas: air borders, visas, police cooperation, and personal data protection. This evaluation process involves a questionnaire and visits by EU experts to selected institutions and workplaces in the country under assessment.[17]\nThe only land borders with border controls (not counting temporary ones) between EU/EEA members, are those dividing Bulgaria and Romania from each other and from the rest of the EU.[18]\n^Greenland and the Faroe Islands are not included in the Schengen Area. However, persons travelling between the Faroe Islands, Greenland and the Schengen Area are not subject to border checks.[32] The list of countries whose citizens require a visa for Greenland or the Faroe Islands is the same as for the Schengen Area,[33][34] but a Schengen visa will not allow the holder access to either territory, only a Danish visa stamped with either \"Valid for the Faroe Islands\" or \"Valid for Greenland\", or both.[35]\n^The overseas departments and collectivities of France are not part of the Schengen Area. However, when travelling by air from metropolitan France directly to French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, R\u00e9union and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, border checks by the French Border Police only take place at the departure airport, not at the arrival airport (where passengers walk past the passport control booths, which will be unstaffed). This arrangement does not, however, apply to direct flights from other Schengen member states, such as the Frankfurt-Martinique flight by Condor. On the other hand, passengers flying from French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, R\u00e9union and Saint Pierre and Miquelon directly to metropolitan France have to undergo border checks by the French Border Police both on departure and on arrival (an arrangement known as 'double contr\u00f4le').[39]\n^East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, joining Schengen, on 3 October 1990.\n^According to a legally non-binding declaration attached to the Greek accession agreement to the Schengen convention,[41] the special status[42] according to the Greek constitution[43] of Mount Athos, has to be taken into account in the application and subsequent preparation of the Schengen acquis.\n^Currently Greece does not have internal land border within Schengen space. All internal border crossings are at the airports or at maritime ports\n^The elimination of border controls took place from 1 January 2000 to 26 March 2000.[45]\n^ abcdEFTA state, which is outside the EU, that is associated with the Schengen activities of the EU,[13] and where the Schengen rules apply.\n^ abA second agreement, which replaced the first, was signed with Iceland and Norway following the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into EU law with the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997.[48]\n^The elimination of border controls took place from 26 October 1997 to 31 March 1998.[50]\n^The full Schengen acquis applies to all Spanish territories, but there are border checks on departure from Ceuta and Melilla to Peninsular Spain or other Schengen countries, because of specific arrangements for visa exemptions for Moroccan nationals resident in the provinces of Tetuan and Nador.[55]\n^For overland borders and seaports; since 29 March 2009 also for airports.[60]\nThe procedure to enter the Schengen Area is that European Commission evaluates certain criteria. These criteria include border control legislation, infrastructure and organisation, personal data protection, visas, deportations, police cooperation and more.[61] After a positive evaluation the Schengen members of the Council of the European Union decides unanimously together with the European Parliament to accept the new member.\nAlthough Cyprus, which joined the EU on 1 May 2004, is legally bound to join the Schengen Area, implementation has been delayed because of the Cyprus dispute. According to former Cypriot Minister of Foreign Affairs Giorgos Lillikas, \"strict and full control based on Schengen will create a huge tribulation on a daily basis for the Turkish Cypriots\" of Northern Cyprus, and it is unclear if this control is possible before the resolution of the dispute.[62] The British Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, a British Overseas Territory which is outside the EU, also needs \"other handling and mechanisms\".[62] Akrotiri and Dhekelia has no border control to Cyprus, but has its own border control at its air base. As of 2018[update] no date has been fixed for implementation of the Schengen rules by Cyprus.[63] Cyprus has less potential benefit from an implementation of Schengen, for it has no land border with another EU member; air travel or around 12 hours of sea travel is needed to the nearest EU member.\nIn November 2019, Cyprus's Foreign Affairs Minister Nikos Christodoulides revealed that Cyprus formally began the process of joining the Schengen Area in September.[64] In 2023, Cyprus joined the Schengen Information System (SIS), meaning that the country has not fully joined the Schengen Area, but that it is very close to achieving this (the implementation of the SIS being one of the last steps). Participation in the SIS allows for cooperation on crime, immigration and other security-related matters within the Schengen Area.[65]\nWhile Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU on 1 January 2007, are also legally bound to join the Schengen Area, implementation has been delayed. On 15 October 2010, Bulgaria and Romania joined SIS II for law enforcement cooperation.[66] On 9 June 2011, the Council of Ministers concluded that the evaluation process had been completed successfully and that the two countries fulfilled all technical accession criteria.[67] Bulgaria's and Romania's bids to join the Schengen Area were approved by the European Parliament in June 2011[68] but rejected by the Council of Ministers in September 2011, with the Dutch and Finnish governments citing concerns about shortcomings in anti-corruption measures and in the fight against organised crime.[69][70] Although the original plan was for the Schengen Area to open its air and sea borders with Bulgaria and Romania by March 2012, and its land borders by July 2012,[70] continued opposition from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands has delayed the two countries' entry to the Schengen Area.[71][72] On 4 October 2017, the European Parliament voted for access of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Information System,[73] on which they gained full access on 1 August 2018.[74] Moreover, \"the final political decision whether the two countries can become part of the Schengen Area and stop systematic border checks with neighbouring EU countries must be taken unanimously by all sides of the European Council.\"[73] On 11 December 2018, the European Parliament voted for the resolution in favour of accepting both countries, requiring the Council of the European Union to \"act swiftly\" on the matter.[75][76]\nOn 3 March 2022, Romanian MEP Eugen Tomac officially requested an answer through a parliamentary question regarding \"what obstacles remain in the path of Romanian accession to the Schengen area 15 years after joining the EU\" as fulfilment of the accession criteria was recognised on 9 June 2011.[77]\nA second attempt for Romania's accession to Schengen was to be established in the Justice and Home Affairs Council from 8\u20139 December 2022, with the EC announcing the topics on the agenda of the meeting,[78] which failed following opposition by Austria,[79] as officials considered Bulgaria and Romania to be a transit route for most immigrants to the country.[80] Romania disputes that assessment,[81] and had unsuccessfully attempted to convince the Austrian government to vote for Romania's accession to Schengen.[82] Despite having declared support for Romania, the Netherlands also voted against due to its opposition for the accession of Bulgaria.[79]\nIn Romania, the Austrian veto caused strong indignation. As a result of the veto, relations between the two states were reduced following the withdrawal of Romania's ambassador to Austria from Vienna.[83] A boycott against Austria by Romanian companies, entrepreneurs, museums and universities also began,[84] and anti-Austrian inscriptions also appeared in branches of Austrian banks in Romania.[85]\nAccording to Euractiv, European institutions are preparing to admit Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen Area in 2023, with border control-free travel by air planned for October 2023, followed by the abolition of land border controls by 1 January 2024.[86] In a resolution, which members of the European Parliament call on the Council to approve Romania and Bulgaria\u2019s accession to the Schengen free-travel area by the end of 2023, adopted on 12 July with 526 votes in favour, 57 votes against, and 42 abstaining, Parliament stresses that \"both countries have already fulfilled the necessary requirements to be admitted into Schengen\".[87] However, in September 2023 Austria reiterated its objection to admitting the countries to the Schengen Area.[88] In response, Romania threatened to challenge Austria's veto at the European Court of Justice to claim financial compensation.[89]\nThe Gibraltar/Spain border in 2004 with the Rock of Gibraltar in the background\nAs a result of Brexit, Gibraltar ceased to be part of the European Union on 31 January 2020, although for most purposes it was treated as part of it during the transition phase until 31 December 2020. Like the United Kingdom, it had not been part of the Schengen Area but, unlike the United Kingdom, Gibraltar had also been outside of the EU customs union.[90] Owing to a declaration lodged by the United Kingdom with the EEC in 1982, in view of the entry into force of the British Nationality Act 1981, Gibraltarians had been counted as British nationals for the purposes of Community law, and as such they had enjoyed full free movement within the European Economic Area and Switzerland.[91] During the Brexit transition period until 31 December 2020, Gibraltar was still for most purposes treated as an EU territory.\nOn 31 December 2020, the governments of Spain and of the United Kingdom (advised by the Government of Gibraltar) came to an agreement in principle on a framework for a UK-EU treaty on aspects of Gibraltar's future relationship with the European Union.[92] Both Spain and the Head of the UK Mission to the European Union subsequently indicated with the European Commission their desire that such an agreement be negotiated and that the EU should seek a mandate for that purpose.[93]\nChief Minister of GibraltarFabian Picardo stated that he anticipates that the arrangement, which will apply for an initial period of four years, will make Gibraltar's port and airport entry points to the Schengen Area. These entry points will be managed by a Frontex operation. Spain, as the neighbouring Schengen member state, will be responsible as regards the European Union for the implementation of the Schengen acquis. Residents of Gibraltar, regardless of their nationality, are anticipated to enjoy maximised and unrestricted mobility to the Schengen Area.[94][93] UK citizens who are not residents of Gibraltar will be subjected to third-country national checks when they enter Gibraltar through the Gibraltar port or airport.[95] It is anticipated that the third-country national check will entail two controls, one by Gibraltar's Borders and Coastguard Agency, giving entry into Gibraltar, and one by Frontex, giving entry into the Schengen Area. Picardo likened this arrangement to the juxtaposed controls at Eurostar stations, although he admitted the situation there is slightly different.[96]\nOn 31 December 2020, Spain's foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said that she anticipated that it would take about six months to negotiate and conclude a treaty but that in the meantime Spain would work to ensure that mobility at the border would be \"as fluid as possible\".[92]\nApart from the unrestricted mobility of persons, the negotiations will also seek to address maximised and unrestricted mobility of goods between Gibraltar and the European Union, and consider matters related to the environment, the level playing field, social security coordination, citizens\u2019 rights, data, and matters related to continued document recognition.[93]\nOn 6 October 2021, the EU agreed to open formal negotiations with UK anticipating an agreement on Gibraltar, and negotiations started soon after.[97] They were ongoing as of February 2022, hopes were they would finish during spring 2022.[98] As of December 2022[update], negotiations were continuing,[99] but appeared to be deadlocked over policing of passport control at Gibraltar airport.[100]\nNo consensus in the Council of the European Union for Justice and Home Affairs that the country should join the Schengen Area, despite fulfilling the formal accession criteria, due to the CVM reports \"showing inadequacies in coming up to the EU's standards for the fight against organised crime and corruption\". On 8 December 2022, the council voted unanimously in favour of Croatia joining but Austria and the Netherlands voted against Romania and Bulgaria joining due to the inflow of illegal migrants and Bulgaria being joined to Romania in the accession process.[103][104][105]\nEU and UK to negotiate a treaty or other arrangement for application in Gibraltar, based on the agreement reached between the UK and Spain on 31 December 2020.[108][109] Gibraltar is not a sovereign state, so in international law the UK acts on behalf of Gibraltar. (See also Effect of Brexit on Gibraltar#Post-Brexit.)\nNo consensus in the Council of the European Union for Justice and Home Affairs that the country should join the Schengen Area, despite fulfilling the formal accession criteria. In June 2021, Romanian PMFlorin C\u00ee\u021bu identified a \"discussion about the CVM report\" as an obstacle.[110] On 8 December 2022, the council voted unanimously in favour of Croatia joining but Austria and the Netherlands voted against Romania and Bulgaria joining due to the inflow of illegal migrants and Bulgaria being joined to Romania in the accession process.[103][78]\nThere are territories of Schengen member states that are exempted from the Schengen Agreement. The only areas of Schengen member states located in Europe but excluded are the Faroe Islands and Svalbard.\nOnly the Netherlands' European territory is part of the Schengen Area. Six Dutch territories in the Caribbean are outside the Area. Three of these territories \u2013 Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (collectively known as the BES islands) \u2013 are special municipalities within the Netherlands proper. The other three \u2013 Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten \u2013 are autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. All islands retain their status as Overseas countries and territories and are thus not part of the European Union. The six territories have a separate visa system from the European part of the Netherlands and people travelling between these islands and the Schengen Area are subjected to full border checks, with a passport being required even for EU/Schengen citizens, including Dutch (national ID cards are not accepted).[114]\nSvalbard is part of Norway and has a special status under international law. It is not part of the Schengen Area. There is no visa regime in existence for Svalbard either for entry, residence or work,[115] but it is difficult to visit Svalbard without travelling through the Schengen Area,[115] although there are charter flights from Russia. Since 2011, the Norwegian government has imposed systematic border checks on individuals wishing to enter and leave Svalbard, requiring a passport or national identity card for non-Norwegian citizens. As a result, the border between Svalbard and the rest of Norway is largely treated like any other external Schengen border.[116] A Schengen visa must be multiple entry to allow returning to Norway.[117] There is no welfare or asylum system for immigrants on Svalbard, and people incapable of supporting themselves may be sent away.[117]\nThe Danish territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland are neither part of the European Union nor part of the Schengen Area, and visas to Denmark are not automatically valid in these territories. However, both of these territories lack border controls on arrivals from the Schengen Area, and the air or sea carriers are responsible for carrying out document checks before boarding, as is common for travel inside the Schengen Area. Citizens of EU/EFTA countries can travel to the Faroes using a passport or a national ID card[118] and to Greenland using a passport only,[119] while citizens of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway or Sweden can use any acceptable identification (such as driving licences or bank ID cards; although this is advised against since aircraft might be diverted to Scotland in bad weather).[118][119]\nWhen EU states were negotiating subsuming the Schengen Agreement into the EU by the Treaty of Amsterdam, Ireland and the United Kingdom were the only member states that had not signed the Agreement. The UK did not want to join and Ireland wished to maintain its Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom and associated islands, an arrangement that would be incompatible with Schengen membership while the UK remained out. As a result, both negotiated an opt-out from the part of the treaty which was to incorporate the Schengen rules (or acquis) into EU Law when it came into effect on 1 May 1999.[120] Under the relevant protocol, either may request to participate in aspects of the Schengen acquis but this is subject to the approval of the Schengen states.[121]\nIn 1999, the UK formally requested participation in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis \u2013 Title III relating to Police Security and Judicial Cooperation, and this request was approved by the Council of the European Union on 29 May 2000.[123] The United Kingdom's formal participation in the previously approved areas of cooperation was put into effect by a 2004 Council decision that came into effect on 1 January 2005.[124]\nAlthough the United Kingdom was not part of the Schengen passport-free area,[125] it still used the Schengen Information System, a governmental database used by European countries to store and disseminate information on individuals and property. This allowed the UK to exchange information with countries that are a part of the Schengen agreement, often for the sake of liaising over law enforcement.[126] In 2020, the UK declared its intent to withdraw from these arrangements at the end of its transition period, and did so on 31 December 2020.\nIn contrast, while Ireland initially submitted a request to participate in the Schengen acquis in 2002, which was approved by the Council of the European Union,[127] that decision took nearly eighteen years to be put into effect. In February 2010 the Irish Minister for Justice, in response to a parliamentary question, said that: \"The measures which will enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being progressed\".[128] Ireland joined the law enforcement aspect of SIS II on 1 January 2021 with plans to have \"full operational capacity\" two months later.[129][130]\nThree European microstates\u2014Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City\u2014are officially not part of Schengen, but are considered de facto within the Schengen Area, as they have open borders and do not have border controls with the Schengen countries that surround them. Some national laws have the text \"countries against which border control is not performed based on the Schengen Agreement and the 562/2006 EU regulation\",[131] which then includes the microstates and other non-EU areas with open borders. The three microstates cannot issue Schengen visas and with the exception of Monaco, are not formally part of the Schengen Area.\nAndorra is landlocked and does not have an airport or seaport, but there are several heliports. Visitors to the country can only gain access by road or helicopter through Schengen members France or Spain. Andorra maintains border controls with both France and Spain. There are border controls in the other direction also, but these are more focused on customs control (Andorra has considerably lower taxes than its neighbours, with for example a standard VAT rate of just 4.5%). Andorra does not have any visa requirements. Citizens of EU countries need either a national identity card or passport to enter Andorra, while anyone else requires a passport or equivalent. Schengen visas are accepted,[132] but those travellers who need a visa to enter the Schengen Area need a multiple-entry visa to visit Andorra, because entering Andorra means leaving the Schengen Area,[133] and re-entering France or Spain is considered a new entry into the Schengen Area. Andorran citizens do not receive a passport stamp when they enter and leave the Schengen Area.[134] Andorra's ambassador to Spain, Jaume Gayt\u00e1n, has said that he hopes that the agreement will include provisions to make the states associate members of the Schengen Agreement.[135]\nLiechtenstein is landlocked and does not have an international airport. It has been a member of the Schengen Area since 2011. It does not have a border check at Balzers heliport, as flights to and from Balzers must be to or from the Schengen Area. Liechtenstein does not issue visas and as such recommends visitors apply for a visa in another Schengen country, e.g. Switzerland.[136]\nMonaco has an open border with France. Schengen laws are administered as if it were part of the EU as a result of bilateral agreements with France, and Schengen visas are accepted. Both French and Mon\u00e9gasque authorities carry out checks at Monaco's seaport and heliport.\nThe Vatican City has an open border with Italy. However, there is no customs union between Italy and Vatican City, hence vehicles may be subject to checks at the border. Typical border controls would not be feasible in Vatican City, due to its small size and unique position, as an enclave within Rome. In 2006, the Vatican City showed interest in joining the Schengen agreement for closer cooperation in information sharing and similar activities covered by the Schengen Information System.[137]\nTotal trade between any two countries in the Schengen Area increases by approximately 0.1% per year. The same amount of increase in trade is gained again for every 1% annual increase in immigration between the countries.[138][4] On average, at each border the removal of controls is equivalent to the removal of a 0.7% tariff, and the cost savings on a trade route increase with the number of internal borders crossed. Countries outside of the Schengen Area also benefit.[7]\nAbout 1.7 million people commute to work across a European border each day, and in some regions these people constitute up to a third of the workforce. For example, 2.1% of the workers in Hungary work in another country, primarily Austria and Slovakia. Each year, there are 1.3 billion crossings of Schengen borders in total. 57 million crossings are due to transport of goods by road, with a value of \u20ac2.8 trillion each year.[4][139][140] The trade in goods is affected more strongly than trade in services, and the decrease in the cost of trade varies from 0.42% to 1.59% depending on geography, trade partners, and other factors.[7]\nA typical Schengen internal border crossing has no border control post and only a common EU-state sign displaying the name of the country being entered, as here between Germany and Austria. The larger blue sign announces entry to the Federal Republic of Germany in German, the smaller white sign announces entry into the German state of Bavaria.\nBefore the implementation of the Schengen Agreement, most borders in Europe were patrolled and a vast network of border posts existed around the continent, to check the identity and entitlement of people wishing to travel from one country to another.\nSince the implementation of the Schengen rules, border posts have been closed (and often entirely removed) between participating countries.\nThe Schengen Borders Code requires participating states to remove all obstacles to free traffic flow at internal borders.[141] Thus, road, rail and air passengers no longer have their identity checked by border guards when travelling between Schengen countries, although security controls by carriers are still permissible.[142] Per EU guidelines all EU citizens are advised to bring a passport and/or national identity card, as one may be required.\nPassport stamps are never issued when travelling between Schengen member states, even when border controls between Schengen member states are temporarily re-introduced.[143]\nAlthough EU and EFTA nationals travelling within the Schengen Area are not required to show passports, national identity cards or other identity documents at an internal border, the laws of most countries still require them to carry national identity documents and to produce them to an authorised person on request.[144] Different rules apply to other nationals.[144] It is the obligation of everyone travelling within the area to be able to show a fully valid form of personal identification accepted by other Schengen states, typically one issued by the state.[145][146]\nAccording to the Schengen rules, hotels and other types of commercial accommodation must register all foreign citizens, including citizens of other Schengen states, by requiring the completion of a registration form by their own hand. This does not apply to accompanying spouses and minor children or members of travel groups. In addition, a valid identification document has to be produced to the hotel manager or staff.[147] The Schengen rules do not require any other procedures; thus, the Schengen states are free to regulate further details on the content of the registration forms, and identity documents which are to be produced, and may also require the persons exempted from registration by Schengen laws to be registered. Enforcement of these rules varies by country.\nThe Schengen regulation on crossing internal borders[148] describes the checks for foreigners done by the police at suitable places inside each country.[clarification needed]\nThe European Union constitutes a customs union and a Value Added Tax area. However, not all Schengen states or all of the territory of Schengen states are part of the customs union or VAT area. Some countries therefore legally conduct customs controls targeted at illegal goods, such as drugs.\nSecurity checks can legally be carried out at ports and airports. Also police checks can be conducted if they:[149]\ndo not have border control as an objective;\nare based on general police information and experience regarding possible threats to public security and aim, in particular, to combat cross-border crime;\nare devised and executed in a manner clearly distinct from systematic checks on persons at the external borders;\nFor flights within the Schengen Area (either between Schengen member states or within the same Schengen member state), law enforcement agencies, airport authorities and air carriers are only permitted to carry out security checks on passengers and may not carry out border checks.[150][151] Such security checks can be conducted through the verification of the passenger's passport or national identity card:[152][153] such a practice must only be used to verify the passenger's identity (for commercial or transport security reasons) and not his or her immigration status.[151] For this reason, law enforcement agencies, airport authorities and air carriers cannot require air passengers flying within the Schengen Area who are third-country nationals to prove the legality of their stay by showing a valid visa or residence permit.[151] In addition, according to European Commission guidelines, identity checks on air passengers flying within the Schengen Area should take place only either at check-in, or upon entry to the secured zone of the airport, or at the boarding gate: passengers should not be required to undergo a verification of their identity on more than one occasion before their flight within the Schengen Area.[151] Notwithstanding those principles, the identity checks function as practical border controls and they affect illegal immigrants who arrive in Greece (which currently has no land border to another Schengen country) and want to go to some other Schengen country.[154][155] The requirements as to which identity document to possess varies by country and airline. Normally a passport or EU national identity card is needed.\nTravellers boarding flights between Schengen countries, but originating from a third country outside the area, are required to go through Schengen entry border checks upon arrival in the Schengen Area. This is because the route originates outside the Schengen Area and the authorities at the final destination would have no way of differentiating between arriving passengers who boarded at the origin and those who joined in the middle. Additionally, travellers are required to process through Schengen exit border checks upon departure.\nA Schengen member state is permitted to reinstate border controls with another Schengen member state for a short period where there is a serious threat to that state's \"public policy or internal security\" or when the \"control of an external border is no longer ensured due to exceptional circumstances\".[156] When such risks arise out of foreseeable events, the state in question must notify the European Commission in advance and consult with other Schengen states.[157]\nThe introduction of temporary controls at internal borders is a prerogative of the member states. Although the European Commission may issue an opinion about the necessity and proportionality of introducing temporary controls at internal borders, it cannot veto or override such a decision if it is taken by a member state.[158]\nIn November 2017, Germany introduced temporary checks on flights arriving from Greece.[161][162][163] Between November 2017 and February 2018, of the 280,000 passengers on flights from Greece who were checked on arrival in Germany, 270 were denied entry into Germany.[164] On 12 May 2018, Germany ended the temporary checks on incoming flights from Greece.[165]\nIn 2019, Denmark set up border controls with Sweden due to serious attacks by Swedish citizens.[166] The controls were scheduled to be in force for six months.[167]\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, almost all Schengen countries set up border controls. Several of these controls blocked citizens of EU/Schengen countries from entering, only allowed citizens or residents of the country to enter, plus prioritised traffic like food transport.[168] On 27 March 2020, the European Commission published 'Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak', stating that member states should allow cross-border workers 'unhindered access' and 'ensure a smooth passage' across the internal Schengen borders if they exercise a 'critical occupation' (such as health professionals, care workers, scientists in health-related fields, workers in the pharmaceutical and medical services/food/transportation/essential infrastructure industries, engineers, Information and Communications Technology professionals, firefighters/police officers/prison officers/security guards, fishermen and public servants). Further, any health screening for cross-border workers must be carried out under the same conditions as the member state's own nationals exercising the same occupations.[169]\nThe yellow and green-coloured countries indicate Schengen members. The green lines indicate internal Schengen land borders without border controls, the yellow lines indicate internal Schengen land borders with ongoing temporary border controls and the red lines indicate the external Schengen land borders with or without full border controls.\nThe table below lists ongoing internal border controls, according to the information that the member states have provided to the European Commission.[170][171] Health checks at the borders are not legally considered to be border controls.[172]\nEuropean migrant crisis, pressure on the asylum reception system, high migratory pressure at the EU\u2019s external border to T\u00fcrkiye and the Western Balkans, threat of arms trafficking and criminal networks due to the war in Ukraine, human smuggling\nFollowing the Tunisian Revolution of 2010\u201311, the government of Italy gave six-month residence permits to some 25,000 Tunisian migrants.[173][174] This allowed the migrants to travel freely in the Schengen Area. In response, both France and Germany threatened to impose border checks, not wanting the Tunisian refugees to enter their territory.[174] In April 2011, for several hours, France blocked trains carrying the migrants at the French/Italian border at Ventimiglia.[174]\nAt the request of France, in May 2011 the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m proposed that more latitude would be available for the temporary re-establishment of border control in the case of strong and unexpected migratory pressure, or the failure of a state to protect the external borders of the EU.[173]\nOn 25 July 2011, in delivering the European Commission's final assessment on the measures taken by Italy and France,[175] the Home Affairs Commissioner said, \"from a formal point of view steps taken by Italian and French authorities have been in compliance with EU law. However, I regret that the spirit of the Schengen rules has not been fully respected\".[175] Ms. Malmstr\u00f6m also called for a more coherent interpretation of the Schengen rules and a stronger evaluation and monitoring system for the Schengen Area.[175]\nDuring the migrant crisis of September 2015, Germany announced it was temporarily bringing border controls back in accordance with the provisions on temporary border controls laid down by the Schengen acquis. Such border controls appear to be an attempt to prevent disorder from making the crisis worse.\nOpen borders appeared to have impeded Germany's ability to provide for very large numbers of persons seeking refuge all at once.\nGermany signals the border controls are only temporary, and only to support an orderly flow of migration into the area.[needs update]\nOther countries, including Austria, Denmark, Slovenia, Hungary, Sweden and Norway have set up border controls in response to the crisis.[176]\nIn December 2015, Sweden passed a temporary law that allows the government to oblige all transport companies to check that their passengers carry valid photographic identification. The new law came into effect on 21 December 2015 and was valid until 21 December 2018.[177] The government decided that the new rules would apply from 4 January 2016 until 4 July 2016. The law led to the mandatory train change and passage through border control at Copenhagen Airport for travelers between Copenhagen and Sweden, and with a reduction in service frequency.[178] Sweden had introduced border control from Denmark earlier (15 November 2015), but that could not stop the migrant flow, since they have the right to apply for asylum once on Swedish ground. First when the transport companies had to stop foreigners on the Danish side, asylum seekers were efficiently stopped. This caused considerable disruption to the train traffic since the railway station did not have capacity for such checks. These checks lasted until 4 May 2017, after the EU commission declared such checks not acceptable.\nOn 30 May 2018, when the migrant crisis border controls were still active in some countries, the European Parliament decided to condemn prolonged border checks between Schengen Area member countries.[179] But this was only a statement as the Parliament does not decide this.\nAlthough some European politicians did call for Europe's internal borders to be temporarily closed,[180] the European Union decided in late February 2020 to turn down the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel area and introducing border controls with Italy.[181][182][183][184][185][186] The deputy leader of the Swiss Ticino League, Lorenzo Quadri, criticised the decision: \"It is alarming that the dogma of wide-open borders is considered a priority.\"[187] United States President Donald Trump said the European Union had \"failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots\" as the U.S. had implemented.[188]\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 stated in early March that \"European countries cannot ban the entry of Italian citizens within the Schengen Area. The only possible way is to have the Italian prime minister call on his fellow citizens to refrain from travelling to other countries of the European Union.\"[189]\nAfter Slovakia, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Poland in mid-March announced complete closure of their national borders, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that \"Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization. Moreover, they have a strong social and economic impact, they disrupt people's lives and business across the borders.\"[190] Von der Leyen also apologised to Italy, amidst widespread discontent among Italians for the lack of solidarity shown by Europe.[191] By the end of March 2020, almost all internal Schengen borders had been closed to non-essential travel. By July 2020, most borders that were closed due to the coronavirus had been reopened.\nParticipating countries are required to apply strict checks on travellers entering and exiting the Schengen Area. These checks are co-ordinated by the European Union's Frontex agency, and subject to common rules. The details of border controls, surveillance and the conditions under which permission to enter into the Schengen Area may be granted are exhaustively detailed in the Schengen Borders Code.[192][193]\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 16 March 2020 the European Commission issued a recommendation to all EU and Schengen member states to introduce a temporary restriction on the entry of third-country nationals (i.e. travellers who are not EEA/Swiss citizens and family members with the right of free movement) to the Schengen Area for non-essential travel for an initial period of 30 days (with the possible prolongation of this period to be assessed based on further developments). However, third-country nationals who are holders of long-term visas or residence permits or are family members of EEA/Swiss citizens are exempt from this restriction. Further, third-country nationals 'with an essential function or need' (such as healthcare workers, transport personnel, aid workers, military personnel, seasonal agricultural workers), passengers in transit, those travelling 'for imperative family reasons' and those 'in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons' are exempt from this restriction. Nevertheless, the European Commission re-iterated that 'coordinated and reinforced health checks' should be carried out on all travellers who are permitted to enter the EU and Schengen Area.[194] All EU (except Ireland) and Schengen member states are now applying this travel restriction.[195]\nFurther, on 30 March 2020, the European Commission published 'Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, on the facilitation of transit arrangements for the repatriation of EU citizens, and on the effects on visa policy' in order to provide 'advice and practical instructions'. The Guidance states that member states are permitted to take measures (such as requiring non-nationals to undergo a period of self-isolation if arriving from a territory affected by COVID-19), provided that the same requirements is imposed on its own nationals. The Guidance also clarifies that citizens of the European micro-states (Andorra, the Holy See, Monaco and San Marino) are exempt from the temporary restriction on the entry of third-country nationals to the European Union and the Schengen Area for non-essential travel. In addition, citizens of Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey should be permitted entry to the European Union and the Schengen Area if they are stranded abroad in order to facilitate repatriation to their country of origin. Third-country nationals (not covered by one of the exemptions from the temporary restriction of entry for non-essential reasons) who seek to enter the Schengen Area will be refused entry at the external border crossing point and will receive a refusal of entry form (with the reason of refusal marked as \"I\" (i.e. a threat to public health)), as well a passport stamp cancelled by an indelible cross in black ink and the letter \"I\" on the right hand side.[196]\nSome EU and Schengen member states have gone further than the European Commission recommendation and have restricted the entry of EEA/Swiss citizens to their respective territories for non-essential travel. For example, on 4 April 2020, French Border Police refused entry to a group of EU and British citizens who arrived in Marseille Provence Airport on a private jet from the UK, with the intention of staying in a holiday villa in Cannes.[197][198]\nOn 8 April 2020, the European Commission invited EU and Schengen member states to extend the restriction on the entry of third-country nationals for non-essential travel for a further period of 30 days until 15 May 2020.[199] On 8 May 2020, the European Commission again invited member states to extend the restriction for another 30 days until 15 June 2020.[200] On 11 June 2020, the European Commission recommended member states to prolong the restriction on the entry of third-country nationals for non-essential travel until 30 June 2020.[201]\nAll persons crossing external borders\u2014inbound or outbound\u2014are subject to a check by a border guard. The only exception is for regular cross-border commuters (both those with the right of free movement and third-country nationals) who are well known to the border guards: once an initial check has shown that there is no alert on record relating to them in the Schengen Information System or national databases, they can only be subject to occasional 'random' checks, rather than systematic checks every time they cross the border.[202][203][204]\nPreviously, EEA and Swiss citizens, as well as their family members enjoying the right of free movement, were subject only to a 'minimum check' when crossing external borders. This meant that their travel document was subject only to a 'rapid' and 'straightforward' visual inspection and an optional check against databases for lost/stolen travel documents. Consultation of the Schengen Information System and other national databases to ensure that the traveller did not represent a security, public policy or health threat was only permitted on a strictly 'non-systematic' basis where such a threat was 'genuine', 'present' and 'sufficiently serious'.[205] In contrast, other travellers were subject to a 'thorough check'.[206]\nHowever, in light of the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, at a meeting of the Council of the European Union on 20 November 2015, interior ministers from the Member States decided to 'implement immediately the necessary systematic and coordinated checks at external borders, including on individuals enjoying the right of free movement'.[207] Amendments were made to the Schengen Border Code to introduce systematic checks of the travel documents of EEA and Swiss citizens, as well as their family members enjoying the right of free movement, against relevant databases when crossing external borders.[208] The new regime came into force on 7 April 2017.\nWhere carrying out systematic checks against databases would have a disproportionate impact on the flow of traffic at an external border, such checks may be relaxed if, on the basis of a risk assessment, it is determined that it would not lead to a security risk.[208][193][how?]\nIn 'exceptional' and 'unforeseen' circumstances where waiting times become excessive, external border checks can be relaxed on a temporary basis.[209][210][example needed]\nBorder guards carry out the following procedures when checking travellers who cross external borders:[208][193]\nProcedure\nEEA/Swiss citizens and family members with right of free movement\nThird-country nationals (on entry)\nThird-country nationals (on exit)\nChecking the traveller's identity based on his/her travel document\nYes\nYes\nYes\nChecking that the travel document is valid and has not expired\nYes\nYes\nYes\nChecking the travel document for signs of falsification or counterfeiting\nChecking the authenticity of the data stored on the RFID chip (if the travel document is biometric)\nOptional\nOptional\nOptional\nChecking the travel document against the list of stolen, misappropriated, lost and invalidated documents in the Schengen Information System, Interpol's SLTD database and other national databases\nYes\nYes\nYes\nConsulting the Schengen Information System and other national databases to ensure that the traveller does not represent a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or international relations of any Schengen Member State\nYes\nOptional (consultation of databases only 'where necessary')\nYes\nRecording the traveller's entry/exit in a database Note that, as of April 2016, only 10 Schengen Member States\u2014Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain\u2014record third-country nationals' entries and exits in their national databases, but data is not exchanged between the national databases of these countries, nor is there a Schengen-wide centralised database tracking entries and exits in all 27 Schengen Member States.[211][212][213][214][215][216][217][218] Only Poland systematically records the entries and exits of EEA and Swiss citizens who are stopped at the border.[219]\nAs shown by the table above, because many procedures are optional, border guards have discretion in deciding how rigorously they check travellers at external border crossing points. As a result, the length of time taken to perform checks differs between Schengen countries. Under the previous regime (whereby those with the right to freedom of movement were subject only to a 'minimum check'), an entry check for an EEA or Swiss citizen took around five seconds on average in Italy, whilst in Norway, on average it took around 1 minute.[217] The disparities in checks on third-country nationals (who are subject to a more thorough check) are even greater. For example, an entry check for an Annex II national takes around 15 seconds on average in Greece, whilst it takes three to five minutes on average in Slovakia.[216][218] Similarly, an entry check for an Annex I national on average lasts around 30\u201360 seconds in the Netherlands, whilst in Latvia, it lasts around two to five minutes on average.[216]\nAfter the new regime came into force on 7 April 2017, significantly longer waiting times were reported at numerous external border crossing points, especially as it was just before the Easter holiday. Travellers entering Slovenia from Croatia (which was not yet part of the Schengen Area) had to wait several hours as Slovenian border guards systematically checked the travel documents of all travellers (including those with the right of free movement) against relevant databases.[223] The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Miro Cerar, acknowledged that the situation was 'unacceptable'. In order to alleviate the long queues, the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases was temporarily suspended from the evening of Friday 7 April 2017 until the end of the weekend.[224][225] However, the following weekend, long queues re-appeared.[226] The Prime Minister of Croatia, Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, criticised the situation, calling it 'unsustainable', and expressed concern about the impact on tourism (which accounts for 18% of Croatia's GDP). The President of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, sent a formal letter to the European Commission to voice her concern about the effect of the new regime on border checks.[227] At a meeting held on 29 April 2017, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, Cerar and Plenkovi\u0107 agreed that, moving forward, the systematic checking of the travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases would be suspended at land border crossing points between Croatia and Slovenia if the waiting time exceeds 15 minutes (with 'targeted checks' being carried out instead).[228] Long queues were also reported at external border crossing points in Greece, where the leadership of the Hellenic Police (which is responsible for border checks) decided to suspend, for a period of 6 months, the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases (with the exception of the Kipoi land border crossing point with Turkey, due to security concerns). Greece was particularly affected by the implementation of the new regime as Greek identity cards are not machine-readable, which meant that border guards had to enter the holder's information manually into the computer system to check the relevant databases if a Greek citizen presented an identity card instead of a passport.[229] Similarly, long waiting times were reported at external border crossing points in France[230] and Spain.[231][232]Finland, Hungary and Italy also issued notifications suspending systematic checks at some external border crossing points.[233] In July 2017, Greece submitted a request to suspend the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases for a further period of 18 months, due to 'infrastructure shortcomings and increased traffic at 12 airports across the country'.[234]\nWhen carrying out checks at external borders, border guards are, by law, required to respect the dignity of travellers (particularly in cases involving vulnerable persons)[235] and are forbidden from discriminating against persons based on their sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.[236]\nExternal border controls are located at roads crossing a border, at airports, at seaports and on board trains.[237] Usually, there is no fence along the land border, but there are exceptions like the Ceuta border fence, and some places at the eastern border.[238] However, surveillance camera systems, some equipped with infrared technology, are located at some more critical spots, for example at the border between Slovakia and Ukraine, where at some points there is a camera every 186 metres (203 yards).[239]\nAll travellers entering and leaving the Schengen Area by general aviation or on a pleasure boat have to make their first point of entry/final point of departure in an airport/aerodrome or a seaport that is designated as an external border crossing point. By way of derogation, travellers on board a pleasure boat are permitted to make their first port of call at a port that is not designated as an external border crossing point if they notify the port authorities and obtain authorisation from the border guards.[240] In practice, however, this is a loophole hard to check, and large-scale drug smuggling using private boats has been uncovered. Along the southern coast of the Schengen countries in the Mediterranean, coast guards make a substantial effort to prevent private boats from entering without permission.\nAt many external border crossing points, there are special lanes for EEA and Swiss citizens (as well as their family members) and other lanes for all travellers regardless of nationality.[241] At some external border crossing points, there is a third type of lane for travellers who are Annex II nationals (i.e. non-EEA/Swiss citizens who are exempt from the visa requirement).[242] Although Andorran and Sammarinese citizens are not EEA citizens, they are nonetheless able to use the special lanes designated for EEA and Swiss citizens.[243] Since 1 January 2021, British citizens are no longer permitted to use the EEA/Swiss lanes.\nSome external border crossing points can only be used by certain travellers. For example, the border checkpoint in Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Slemence, Slovakia (on the border with Ukraine) can only be crossed by pedestrians or cyclists who are EEA, Swiss or Ukrainian citizens.[244] The border checkpoint in Ramoni\u0161kiai, Lithuania (on the border with Russia) can only be crossed by residents of Lithuania and Russia; all other travellers (including EEA and Swiss citizens not resident in Lithuania/Russia) cannot use this border checkpoint.[245] Similarly, the border checkpoint of Pededze-Brunishevo, Latvia (on the border with Russia) is only open to Latvian and Russian citizens.[246] The Narva 2 and Saatse border crossing points in Estonia (on the border with Russia) can only be used by residents of Estonia and Russia.[247] The border checkpoint in Po\u0142owce-Pieszczatka, Poland (on the border with Belarus) can only be crossed by Polish and Belarusian nationals.[248] In 2016, as a temporary measure for 180 days, the two northernmost border checkpoints of Raja-Jooseppi and Salla on the Finland\u2013Russia border could only be crossed by Finnish, Russian and Belarusian citizens (as well as their family members); all other nationals, including non-Finnish EEA and Swiss citizens, were not permitted to use these border checkpoints.[249] Further, the border crossing points of Haapovaara, Inari, Karttimo, Kurvinen, Leminaho and Parikkala (as well as the railway crossing point of Imatra) are only open to Finnish and Russian citizens.[250]\nThe additional obligations imposed by European law on national border authorities when it comes to processing travellers who are third-country nationals (e.g. the obligation to stamp their travel documents) should not prevent the development of automated border control systems which are made available to such travellers. As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated border gates in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, South Korean and United Statesbiometric passports,[251] as well as by the Portuguese Servi\u00e7o de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated border gates in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports. This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of eGates include holders of Australian, Canadian, Israeli, Japanese, New Zealand, Singaporean, South Korean, United States and Vaticanbiometric passports. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch Royal Marechaussee at the Privium iris recognition automated border gates at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (where eligible users include registered EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are Global Entry members, and all nationals who are holders of diplomatic passports), as well as by the German Federal Police at the ABG Plus iris recognition automated border gates at Frankfurt Airport (where eligible users include registered EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are Global Entry members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped.[252] At the Port of Helsinki, the Finnish Border Guard has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include Russian citizens (who, as Annex I nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.[251]\nIn November 2016 the European Commission proposed a system for an electronic authorisation of visa-exempt third country nationals called ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System).[255] Foreign visitors will be required to submit personal data in advance and pay a processing fee (fee is waived for children). The application is to be done over the internet and need to be made a few days before travel. The authorisation will be valid for three years. It is imagined as a system similar to the ESTA system of the United States and the ETA system of Canada. ETIAS is scheduled to enter into operation by May 2025.[256]\nETIAS requirements will, in general, apply to those third country nationals who are not required to have a visa and have no residence permit or similar.\nSchengen rules require that all carriers conveying passengers across the Schengen external border must check, before boarding, that passengers have the correct travel documents and visas required for entry.[257] Carriers that transport third-country nationals without the correct travel documents are imposed with financial penalties and are required to transport those refused entry back to the point of departure.[258] The aim of this measure is to prevent illegal immigration. Further, since immigrants have the right to apply for asylum at border control at ports of entry in the EU, though such applications must be made in person in the country where asylum status is sought, this measure has the effect of preventing prospective asylum seekers from boarding public transportation to the Schengen Area (unless they have already obtained a Schengen visa or are visa-exempt).\nThe rules applicable to short-term entry visas into the Schengen Area are set out in EU regulations which contain two lists: a list of the nationalities (or classes of travel document holder) which require a visa for a short-term stay (the Annex I list) and a list which do not (the Annex II list).[259]\nBeing listed in the visa-free list will sometimes but not always exempt the listed nationality or class from the requirement to obtain a work permit if they wish to take up employment or self-employed activity during their stay; business trips are not normally considered employment in this sense.[260]\nAn application for a Schengen visa should be submitted to the embassy or consulate of the country which the traveller intends to visit. If a traveller plans to visit multiple countries in the Schengen Area, the application should be submitted to the embassy or consulate of the main destination. If the main destination cannot be determined, the traveller should apply for the visa at the embassy or consulate of the Schengen member state of first entry.[261] Often, external service providers are contracted by certain diplomatic missions to process, collect and return visa applications.[262]\nThe standard application fee for a Schengen visa is EUR 80. There is a reduced visa application fee of EUR 40 for children aged 6 to 12. The visa application fee is waived for children under the age of 6. Where an application is submitted to an external service provider, an additional service fee may have to be paid. The visa application fee (and the additional service fee, if applicable) are not refundable regardless of the outcome of the application.[263]\nA Schengen visa or a visa exemption does not entitle the traveller to enter the Schengen Area, but rather allows the traveller to seek entry at the border crossing point. The Schengen Borders Code lists requirements which third-country nationals must meet to be allowed into the Schengen Area. For this purpose, a third-country national is a person who does not enjoy the right of free movement (i.e. a person who is not an EEA citizen or Swiss, nor a family member of such a person).\nThe entry requirements for third country nationals who intend to stay in the Schengen Area for not more than 90 days in any 180-day period are as follows:[264]\nThe traveller is in possession of a valid travel document or documents authorising them to cross the border (a visa is not considered a travel document in this sense); the acceptance of travel documents for this purpose remains within the domain of the member states;[265]\nThe travel document must be valid for at least 3 months after the intended date of departure from the Schengen Area (although in a justified case of emergency, this obligation may be waived) and must have been issued within the previous 10 years;[266]\nThe traveller either possesses a valid visa (if required) or a valid residence permit;\nThe traveller can justify the purpose and conditions of the intended stay and has sufficient means of subsistence, both for the duration of the intended stay and for the return to his or her country of origin or transit to a third country into which the traveller is certain to be admitted, or is in a position to acquire such means lawfully;\nThe traveller is not considered to be a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Schengen states.\nHowever, even if the third-country national does not fulfil the criteria for entry, admission may still be granted:[267]\nOn humanitarian grounds\nOn grounds of national interests\nOn grounds of international obligations\nIf the person is not in possession of a visa, but fulfils the criteria for being issued a visa at the border\nIf the person holds a residence permit or a re-entry visa issued by a Schengen state\nBorder guards are required to stamp the travel documents of third-country nationals when they cross external borders.[268] However, nationals of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City are exempt from this requirement, as are heads of state, whose visits were announced through diplomatic channels, and holders of local border traffic permits and residence permits issued by a Schengen member state.[269][270] Certain exemptions also apply to the crews of ships and aircraft.[271] Third-country nationals who otherwise fulfil all the criteria for admission into the Schengen Area must not be denied entry for the sole reason that there is no remaining empty space in their travel document to affix a stamp; instead, the stamp should be affixed on a separate sheet of paper.[272]\nFor stays in the Schengen Area as a whole which exceed 90 days, a third-country national will need to hold either a long-stay visa for a period no longer than a year, or a residence permit for longer periods. A long-stay visa is a national visa but is issued in accordance with a uniform format. It entitles the holder to enter the Schengen Area and remain in the issuing state for a period longer than 90 days but no more than one year. If a Schengen state wishes to allow the holder of a long-stay visa to remain there for longer than a year, the state must issue him or her with a residence permit.\nThe holder of a long-stay visa or a residence permit is entitled to move freely within other states which compose the Schengen Area for a period of up to three months in any half-year.[273] Third-country nationals who are long-term residents in a Schengen state may also acquire the right to move to and settle in another Schengen state without losing their legal status and social benefits.[274]\nAsylum seekers who request international protection under the Geneva Convention from a Schengen member state are not issued a residence permit, but are instead issued, within three days of the application being lodged, an authorisation to remain on the territory of the member state while the application is pending or being examined. This means that, whilst their application for refugee status is being processed, asylum seekers are only permitted to remain in the Schengen member state where they have claimed asylum and are not entitled to move freely within other states which compose the Schengen Area.[275] Successful applicants who have been granted international protection by a Schengen member state are issued residence permits which are valid for at least three years and renewable, whilst applicants granted subsidiary protection by a Schengen member state are issued residence permits valid for at least 1-year and renewable, unless there are compelling reasons relating to national security or public order. Family members of beneficiaries of international or subsidiary protection from a Schengen member state are issued residence permits as well, but their validity can be shorter.[276] Applicants who have been granted temporary protection by a Schengen member state (as well as their reunited family members) are issued residence permits valid for the entire period of temporary protection.[277]\nHowever, some third-country nationals are permitted to stay in the Schengen Area for more than 90 days without the need to apply for a long-stay visa. For example, France does not require citizens of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City to apply for a long-stay visa.[278] In addition, Article 20(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement allows for this 'in exceptional circumstances' and for bilateral agreements concluded by individual signatory states with other countries before the Convention entered into force to remain applicable. As a result, for example, New Zealand citizens are permitted to stay for up to 90 days in each of the Schengen countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) which had already concluded bilateral visa exemption agreements with the New Zealand Government prior to the Convention entering into force without the need to apply for long-stay visas, but if travelling to other Schengen countries the 90 days in a 180-day period time limit applies.[279][280][281][282][283][284][285][286][287][288][289][excessive citations]\nHolders of a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen issued by a Schengen member state can travel to another Schengen member state without a visa, regardless of whether they are travelling independently, or accompanying or joining their EEA/Swiss citizen family member. However, holders of a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen issued by Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland, and the UK can travel to the Schengen Area without a visa only if they are accompanying or joining their EEA/Swiss citizen family member.[295] British citizens had until 30 June 2021 to apply for the card.\nHowever, as of December 2008, the right of entry of family members of EEA/Swiss citizens laid down in Articles 5(2) and 5(4) of Directive 2004/38/EC has been incorrectly transposed into Belgian, Latvian and Swedish law, and not transposed at all by Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Lithuania, Germany and Slovenia.[297] Five member states do not follow the Directive to the effect that non-EEA family members may still face difficulties (denial of boarding the vessel by the transport company, denial to enter by border police) when travelling to those states using their residence card issued by another EU member state. A visa or other document(s) may still be required.[297]\nExternal Schengen or EU borders which have local border traffic permits.\nSchengen states which share an external land border with a non-EU member state are authorised by virtue of the EU Regulation 1931/2006 to conclude or maintain bilateral agreements with neighbouring third countries for the purpose of implementing a local border traffic regime.[298] Such agreements define a border area which may extend to a maximum of 50 kilometres (31 mi) on either side of the border, and provide for the issuance of local border traffic permits to residents of the border area. Permits may be used to cross the EU external border within the border area, are not stamped on crossing the border and must display the holder's name and photograph, as well as a statement that its holder is not authorised to move outside the border area and that any abuse shall be subject to penalties.\nPermits are issued with a validity period of between one and five years and allow for a stay in the border area of up to three months. Permits may only be issued to lawful residents of the border area who have been resident in the border area for a minimum of one year (or longer if specified by the bilateral agreement). Applicants for a permit have to show that they have legitimate reasons to cross frequently an external land border under the local border traffic regime. Schengen states must keep a central register of the permits issued and have to provide immediate access to the relevant data to other Schengen states.\nHolders of local border traffic permits are able to spend up to 3 months every time they enter the border area of the country which has issued the permit (this time limit is far more generous than the \"90 days in a 180-day period\" normally granted to third-country nationals visiting the Schengen Area).[299]\nBefore the conclusion of an agreement with a neighbouring country, the Schengen state must receive approval from the European Commission, which has to confirm that the draft agreement is in conformity with the Regulation. The agreement may only be concluded if the neighbouring state grants at least reciprocal rights to EEA and Swiss nationals resident on the Schengen side of the border area, and agrees to the repatriation of individuals found to be abusing the border agreement.\nAs of June 2017[update] ten local-traffic agreements have come into force.\nAn agreement between Croatia\u2013Bosnia and Herzegovina is applied on provisional basis, pending ratification.[302]\nOn 28 April 2014, Moldova was classified as an 'Annex II' nationality. On 11 June 2017, Ukraine was classified as an 'Annex II' nationality. Therefore, Moldovan and Ukrainian citizens who hold biometric passports no longer require a visa to enter the Schengen Area and Romania, thus obviating the need to apply for a local border traffic permit (unless they wish to spend more than 90 days in a 180-day period permitted by the visa exemption, given that local border traffic permit holders are allowed to stay for 3 months in the border area on each entry).\nThere are or have been plans for Lithuania\u2013Russia, Poland\u2013Belarus, Bulgaria\u2013Serbia and Bulgaria\u2013North Macedonia local border traffic agreements.[306]\nThe agreement between Poland and Belarus had been due to enter into force by 2012,[307] but was delayed by Belarus,[308] with no implementation date set (as of Oct 2012).[309]\nIn late 2009, Norway began issuing one-year multiple-entry visas, without the usual requirement of having family or a business partner in Norway, called Pomor-Visas, to Russians from Murmansk Oblast, and later to those from Arkhangelsk Oblast.[310] Finland is not planning border permits, but has issued over one million regular visas for Russians in 2011, and many of them multiple-entry visas. The EU was planning to allow up to 5-year validity on multiple-entry visas for Russians.[311]\nThere is also a similar system for local border traffic permits between Spain and Morocco regarding Ceuta and Melilla. This system is older and was included in the 1991 accession treaty of Spain to the Schengen Area.[55] In this case there are identity checks for anyone travelling to other parts of the Schengen Area (possible by boat and air only). Such checks are not the rule for other local border traffic zones.\nCitizens of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia can enter the Schengen Area without a visa. On 30 November 2009, the EU Council of Ministers for Interior and Justice abolished visa requirements for citizens of Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia,[312] while on 8 November 2010 it did the same for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.[313] The former took effect on 19 December 2009,[259] and the latter on 15 December 2010.[314]\nVisa liberalisation negotiations between the EU and the Western Balkans (excluding Kosovo) were launched in the first half of 2008, and ended in 2009 (for Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) and 2010 (for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina). Before visas were fully abolished, the Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) had signed \"visa facilitation agreements\" with the Schengen states in 2008. The visa facilitation agreements were, at the time, supposed to shorten waiting periods, lower visa fees (including free visas for certain categories of travellers), and reduce paperwork. In practice, however, the new procedures turned out to be longer, more cumbersome, more expensive, and many people complained that it was easier to obtain visas before the facilitation agreements entered into force.[315][316][317]\nThe European Commission launched a visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo on 19 January 2012. In June 2012, the Commission handed over a roadmap on visa liberalisation to the Kosovo authorities, which identified the legislation and institutional measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation. On 4 May 2016, the European Commission proposed visa-free travel for the citizens of Kosovo. The European Commission has proposed to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament to lift the visa requirements for the people of Kosovo by transferring Kosovo to the visa-free list for short-stays in the Schengen Area. The EU approved the visa exemption for nationals of Kosovo, effective from 1 January 2024.\nTo counter the potentially aggravating effects of the abolition of border controls on undocumented immigration and cross-border crime, the Schengen acquis contains compensatory police and judicial measures.[318] Chief among these is the Schengen Information System (SIS),[318] a database operated by all EU and Schengen states and which by January 2010 contained in excess of 30 million entries and by January 2014 contained in excess of 50 million entries, according to a document published in June 2015 by the Council of the European Union.[319] Around 1 million of the entries relate to persons, 72% of which were not allowed to enter and stay in the Schengen Area. Only 7% of persons listed on the SIS database were missing persons.\nThe vast majority of data entries on the SIS, around 49 million, concern lost or stolen objects. The European Council reports that in 2013 an average of 43 stolen vehicles a day were detected by authorities using the SIS database.[319]\nThe Schengen Agreement also allows police officers from one participating state to follow suspects across borders both in hot pursuit[322] and to continue observation operations, and for enhanced mutual assistance in criminal matters.[323]\nThe Schengen Convention also contained measures intended to streamline extradition between participating countries however these have now been subsumed into the European Arrest Warrant system.[324]\nThe legal basis for Schengen in the treaties of the European Union has been inserted in the Treaty establishing the European Community through Article 2, point 15 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. This inserted a new title named \"Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons\" into the treaty, currently numbered as Title IV, and comprising articles 61 to 69.[325] The Treaty of Lisbon substantially amends the provisions of the articles in the title, renames the title to \"Area of freedom, security and justice\" and divides it into five chapters, called \"General provisions\", \"Policies on border checks, asylum and immigration\", \"Judicial cooperation in civil matters\", \"Judicial cooperation in criminal matters\", and \"Police cooperation\".[326]\nThe Schengen Area originally had its legal basis outside the then European Economic Community, having been established by a sub-set of member states of the Community using two international agreements:\nThe 1985 Schengen Agreement \u2013 Agreement between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders.\nThe 1990 Schengen Convention \u2013 Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders.\n^The United Kingdom, the administering power, considers that the area of Gibraltar is 6.8km2, while for Spain it is 6.7km2.[107] However, the various extensions using land reclaimed from the sea have in practice increased it to 6.8km2.\n^\"Frequently asked questions\". europa.eu.

Instead, the border guard should check the validity of the residence permit. (See Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of the provisions on stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals in accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (COM (2009) 489, p. 7), \"The Commission is of the opinion that travel documents of third-country nationals who are in possession of a valid residence permit issued by a Schengen Member State should not be stamped. The purpose of stamping a passport serves to establish whether a third country national respected the authorised length of a short stay within the Schengen area. This logic cannot be applied to third country nationals holding a valid residence permit, as the allowed period of stay in the Schengen Member State which issued the permit is determined by the validity of the residence permit.\")\n^ abcSome Schengen member states have exempted certain categories of travellers who are subject to a thorough check from the requirement to demonstrate sufficient funds for his/her stay, proof of onward/return journey and explaining his/her purpose of stay to the border guard at external border crossing points. For example, France exempts Andorran and Mon\u00e9gasque nationals, holders of residence permits and family reunification visas, diplomats, flight crew etc. from this requirement (see diplomatie.gouv.fr).\n^Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code), the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, Council Regulations (EC) No 1683/95 and (EC) No 539/2001 and Regulations (EC) No 767/2008 and (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 182, 29 June 2013, p. 5)\n^Article 7, Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (OJ L 77, 23 March 2016, p. 1)\n^Points 2.2-2.3 and 3.2.4-3.2.5, Annex VI, Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (OJ L 77, 23 March 2016, p. 1)\n^Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code), the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, Council Regulations (EC) No 1683/95 and (EC) No 539/2001 and Regulations (EC) No 767/2008 and (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 182, 29 June 2013, p. 6)\n^Update of the list of border crossing points as referred to in Article 2(8) of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (OJ C 58, 18 February 2021, p. 35\u201349)\n^Update of the list of border crossing points referred to in Article 2(8) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (OJ C 126, 18 April 2015, p. 10\u201321)\n^Update of the list of border crossing points referred to in Article 2(8) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (OJ C 84, 4 March 2016, p. 6)\n^Update of the list of border crossing points as referred to in Article 2(8) of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (OJ C 278, 30 July 2016, p. 47\u201348)\n^Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper with the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller.

        "context": "\nAl-Qaeda only indirectly controls its day-to-day operations. Its philosophy calls for the centralization of decision making, while allowing for the decentralization of execution.[91] The top leaders of Al-Qaeda have defined the organization's ideology and guiding strategy, and they have also articulated simple and easy-to-receive messages. At the same time, mid-level organizations were given autonomy, but they had to consult with top management before large-scale attacks and assassinations. Top management included the shura council as well as committees on military operations, finance, and information sharing. Through the information committees of Al-Qaeda, Zawahiri placed special emphasis on communicating with his groups.[92] However, after the war on terror, Al-Qaeda's leadership has become isolated. As a result, the leadership has become decentralized, and the organization has become regionalized into several Al-Qaeda groups.[93][94]\nMany Western analysts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by Al-Qaeda's leadership. However, bin Laden held considerable ideological influence over revolutionary Islamist movements across the world. Experts argue that Al-Qaeda has fragmented into a number of disparate regional movements, and that these groups bear little connection with one another.[95]\nThis view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with Tayseer Allouni:\nthis matter isn't about any specific person and... is not about the al-Qa'idah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one... and all the true believers [mu'mineen] are brothers. So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an 'organization' with a specific name (such as 'al-Qa'idah') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called 'The Base' ['Al-Qa'idah'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren't separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east, from the Philippines to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation.[96]\nAs of 2010[update] however, Bruce Hoffman saw Al-Qaeda as a cohesive network that was strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas.[95]\nOsama bin Laden served as the emir of Al-Qaeda from the organization's founding in 1988 until his assassination by US forces on May 1, 2011.[107]Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011.[108]\nBin Laden was advised by a Shura Council, which consists of senior Al-Qaeda members.[109] The group was estimated to consist of 20\u201330 people.\nAyman al-Zawahiri had been Al-Qaeda's deputy emir and assumed the role of emir following bin Laden's death. Al-Zawahiri replaced Saif al-Adel, who had served as interim commander.[110]\nOn June 5, 2012, Pakistani intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman's alleged successor as second in command, Abu Yahya al-Libi, had been killed in Pakistan.[111]\nNasir al-Wuhayshi was alleged to have become Al-Qaeda's overall second in command and general manager in 2013. He was concurrently the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) until he was killed by a US airstrike in Yemen in June 2015.[112]Abu Khayr al-Masri, Wuhayshi's alleged successor as the deputy to Ayman al-Zawahiri, was killed by a US airstrike in Syria in February 2017.[113] Al Qaeda's next alleged number two leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, was killed by Israeli agents. His pseudonym was Abu Muhammad al-Masri, who was killed in November 2020 in Iran. He was involved in the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.[114]\nAl-Qaeda's network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network which drew upon the leadership of a number of regional nodes.[115] The organization divided itself into several committees, which include:\nThe Military Committee, which is responsible for training operatives, acquiring weapons, and planning attacks.\nThe Money/Business Committee, which funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the hawala banking system. US-led efforts to eradicate the sources of \"terrorist financing\"[116] were most successful in the year immediately following the September 11 attacks.[117] Al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so hawaladars in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to US$10million.[118] The committee also procures false passports, pays Al-Qaeda members, and oversees profit-driven businesses.[119] In the 9/11 Commission Report, it was estimated that Al-Qaeda required $30million per year to conduct its operations.\nThe Law Committee reviews Sharia law, and decides upon courses of action conform to it.\nThe Islamic Study/Fatwah Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans.\nIn 2005, Al-Qaeda formed As-Sahab, a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials.\nAl-Zawahiri was killed on July 31, 2022 in a drone strike in Afghanistan.[120] In February 2023, a report from the United Nations, based on member state intelligence, concluded that de facto leadership of Al-Qaeda had passed to Saif al-Adel, who was operating out of Iran. Adel, a former Egyptian army officer, became a military instructor in Al-Qaeda camps in the 1990s and was known for his involvement in the Battle of Mogadishu. The report stated that al-Adel's leadership could not officially be declared by al-Qaeda because of \"political sensitivities\" of Afghan government in acknowledging the death of Al-Zawahiri as well as due to \"theological and operational\" challenges posed by the location of al-Adel in Iran.[121][122]\nMost of Al Qaeda's top leaders and operational directors were veterans who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were the leaders who were considered the operational commanders of the organization.[123] Nevertheless, Al-Qaeda is not operationally managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri. Several operational groups exist, which consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation.[124] Al-Qaeda central (AQC) is a conglomerate of expert committees, each in supervision of distinct tasks and objectives. Its membership is mostly composed of Egyptian Islamist leaders who participated in the anti-communistAfghan Jihad. Assisting them are hundreds of Islamic field operatives and commanders, based in various regions of the Muslim World. The central leadership assumes control of the doctrinal approach and overall propaganda campaign; while the regional commanders were empowered with independence in military strategy and political maneuvering. This novel hierarchy made it possible for the organisation to launch wide-range offensives.[125]\nWhen asked in 2005 about the possibility of Al-Qaeda's connection to the July 7, 2005 London bombings, Metropolitan Police CommissionerSir Ian Blair said: \"Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working... but this has the hallmark of that approach... Al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training... to provide expertise... and I think that is what has occurred here.\"[126] On August 13, 2005, The Independent newspaper, reported that the July7 bombers had acted independently of an Al-Qaeda mastermind.[127]\nNasser al-Bahri, who was Osama bin Laden's bodyguard for four years in the run-up to 9/11 wrote in his memoir a highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time. Al-Bahri described Al-Qaeda's formal administrative structure and vast arsenal.[128] However, the author Adam Curtis argued that the idea of Al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contended the name \"Al-Qaeda\" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa. Curtis wrote:\nThe reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term \"al-Qaeda\" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it.[129]\nDuring the 2001 trial, the US Department of Justice needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him in absentia under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin Laden.[130] Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack US military establishments.[131][132] Sam Schmidt, a defense attorney who defended al-Fadl said:\nThere were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.[129]\nThe number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core Al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170.[133] In 2006, it was estimated that Al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 countries.[134] As of 2009[update], it was believed that no more than 200\u2013300 members were still active commanders.[135]\nAccording to the 2004 BBC documentary The Power of Nightmares, Al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted Al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of Al-Qaeda existed.[136] Al-Qaeda's commanders, as well as its sleeping agents, are hiding in different parts of the world to this day. They are mainly hunted by the American and Israeli secret services.\nAccording to author Robert Cassidy, Al-Qaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was \"organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces\" in the Soviet\u2013Afghan war.[134] The force was composed primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad. Another group, which numbered 10,000 in 2006, live in the West and have received rudimentary combat training.[134]\nOther analysts have described Al-Qaeda's rank and file as being \"predominantly Arab\" in its first years of operation, but that the organization also includes \"other peoples\" as of 2007[update].[137] It has been estimated that 62 percent of Al-Qaeda members have a university education.[138] In 2011 and the following year, the Americans successfully settled accounts with Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki, the organization's chief propagandist, and Abu Yahya al-Libi's deputy commander. The optimistic voices were already saying it was over for Al-Qaeda. Nevertheless, it was around this time that the Arab Spring greeted the region, the turmoil of which came great to Al-Qaeda's regional forces. Seven years later, Ayman al-Zawahiri became arguably the number one leader in the organization, implementing his strategy with systematic consistency. Tens of thousands loyal to Al-Qaeda and related organizations were able to challenge local and regional stability and ruthlessly attack their enemies in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and Russia alike. In fact, from Northwest Africa to South Asia, Al-Qaeda had more than two dozen \"franchise-based\" allies. The number of Al-Qaeda militants was set at 20,000 in Syria alone, and they had 4,000 members in Yemen and about 7,000 in Somalia. The war was not over.[139]\nIn 2001, Al-Qaeda had around 20 functioning cells and 70,000 insurgents spread over sixty nations.[140] According to latest estimates, the number of active-duty soldiers under its command and allied militias have risen to approximately 250,000 by 2018.[141]\nAl-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.[142] In the 1990s, financing came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden.[143] Other sources of income included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic Gulf states.[143] A WikiLeaks-released 2009 internal US government cable stated that \"terrorist funding emanating from Saudi Arabia remains a serious concern.\"[144]\nAmong the first pieces of evidence regarding Saudi Arabia's support for Al-Qaeda was the so-called \"Golden Chain\", a list of early Al-Qaeda funders seized during a 2002 raid in Sarajevo by Bosnian police.[145] The hand-written list was validated by Al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl, and included the names of both donors and beneficiaries.[145][146] Osama bin-Laden's name appeared seven times among the beneficiaries, while 20 Saudi and Gulf-based businessmen and politicians were listed among the donors.[145] Notable donors included Adel Batterjee, and Wael Hamza Julaidan. Batterjee was designated as a terror financier by the US Department of the Treasury in 2004, and Julaidan is recognized as one of Al-Qaeda's founders.[145]\nDocuments seized during the 2002 Bosnia raid showed that Al-Qaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe.[147] Notably, this activity exploited the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and the Muslim World League (MWL). The IIRO had ties with Al-Qaeda associates worldwide, including Al-Qaeda's deputy Ayman al Zawahiri. Zawahiri's brother worked for the IIRO in Albania and had actively recruited on behalf of Al-Qaeda.[148] The MWL was openly identified by Al-Qaeda's leader as one of the three charities Al-Qaeda primarily relied upon for funding sources.[148]\nSeveral Qatari citizens have been accused of funding Al-Qaeda. This includes Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, a Qatari citizen and a human-rights activist who founded the Swiss-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Alkarama. On December 18, 2013, the US Treasury designated Nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting Al-Qaeda.[149] The US Treasury has said Nuaimi \"has facilitated significant financial support to Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Qatar-based donors\".[149]\nNuaimi was accused of overseeing a $2million monthly transfer to Al-Qaeda in Iraq as part of his role as mediator between Iraq-based Al-Qaeda senior officers and Qatari citizens.[149][150] Nuaimi allegedly entertained relationships with Abu-Khalid al-Suri, Al-Qaeda's top envoy in Syria, who processed a $600,000 transfer to Al-Qaeda in 2013.[149][150] Nuaimi is also known to be associated with Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, a Yemeni politician and founding member of Alkarama, who was listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the US Treasury in 2013.[151] The US authorities claimed that Humayqani exploited his role in Alkarama to fundraise on behalf of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).[149][151] A prominent figure in AQAP, Nuaimi was also reported to have facilitated the flow of funding to AQAP affiliates based in Yemen. Nuaimi was also accused of investing funds in the charity directed by Humayqani to ultimately fund AQAP.[149] About ten months after being sanctioned by the US Treasury, Nuaimi was also restrained from doing business in the UK.[152]\nAnother Qatari citizen, Kalifa Mohammed Turki Subayi, was sanctioned by the US Treasury on June 5, 2008, for his activities as a \"Gulf-based Al-Qaeda financier\". Subayi's name was added to the UN Security Council's Sanctions List in 2008 on charges of providing financial and material support to Al-Qaeda senior leadership.[150][153] Subayi allegedly moved Al-Qaeda recruits to South Asia-based training camps.[150][153] He also financially supported Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani national and senior Al-Qaeda officer who is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11 attack according to the 9/11 Commission Report.[154]\nQataris provided support to al-Qaeda through the country's largest NGO, the Qatar Charity. Al-Qaeda defector al-Fadl, who was a former member of Qatar Charity, testified in court that Abdullah Mohammed Yusef, who served as Qatar Charity's director, was affiliated to Al-Qaeda and simultaneously to the National Islamic Front, a political group that gave al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden harbor in Sudan in the early 1990s.[146]\nIt was alleged that in 1993 Osama bin Laden was using Middle East based Sunni charities to channel financial support to Al-Qaeda operatives overseas. The same documents also report Bin Laden's complaint that the failed assassination attempt of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had compromised the ability of Al-Qaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent it was capable of before 1995.[citation needed]\nQatar financed Al-Qaeda's enterprises through Al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra. The funding was primarily channeled through kidnapping for ransom.[155] The Consortium Against Terrorist Finance (CATF) reported that the Gulf country has funded al-Nusra since 2013.[155] In 2017, Asharq Al-Awsat estimated that Qatar had disbursed $25million in support of al-Nusra through kidnapping for ransom.[156] In addition, Qatar has launched fundraising campaigns on behalf of al-Nusra. Al-Nusra acknowledged a Qatar-sponsored campaign \"as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group\".[157][158]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(August 2016)\nIn the disagreement over whether Al-Qaeda's objectives are religious or political, Mark Sedgwick describes Al-Qaeda's strategy as political in the immediate term but with ultimate aims that are religious.[159]\nOn March 11, 2005, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Saif al-Adel's document \"Al Qaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020\".[8][160]Abdel Bari Atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the Ummah from all forms of oppression:\nProvoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on US soil that results in massive civilian casualties.\nIncite local resistance to occupying forces.\nExpand the conflict to neighboring countries and engage the US and its allies in a long war of attrition.\nConvert Al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the US and countries allied with the US until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the 2004 Madrid train bombings, but which did not have the same effect with the July 7, 2005 London bombings.\nThe US economy will finally collapse by 2020, under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places. This will lead to a collapse in the worldwide economic system, and lead to global political instability. This will lead to a global jihad led by Al-Qaeda, and a WahhabiCaliphate will then be installed across the world.\nAccording to Fouad Hussein, a Jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with Al-Zarqawi, Al-Qaeda's strategy consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in Al Qaeda's Strategy to the year 2020. These phases include:[161]\n\"The Awakening.\" This phase was supposed to last from 2001 to 2003. The goal of the phase is to provoke the United States to attack a Muslim country by executing an attack that kills many civilians on US soil.\n\"Opening Eyes.\" This phase was supposed to last from 2003 to 2006. The goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the Al-Qaeda group into a movement. Iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states.\n\"Arising and Standing up\", was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010. In this phase, Al-Qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on Syria. Hussein believed other countries in the Arabian Peninsula were also in danger.\nAl-Qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the Arabian Peninsula. The main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and cyberterrorism, targeting the US economy and military infrastructure.\nThe declaration of an Islamic Caliphate, which was projected between 2013 and 2016. In this phase, Al-Qaeda expected the resistance from Israel to be heavily reduced.\nThe declaration of an \"Islamic Army\" and a \"fight between believers and non-believers\", also called \"total confrontation\".\n\"Definitive Victory\", projected to be completed by 2020.\nAccording to the seven-phase strategy, the war is projected to last less than two years.\nAccording to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute and Katherine Zimmerman of the American Enterprise Institute, the new model of Al-Qaeda is to \"socialize communities\" and build a broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities, also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks.[162]\nThe doctrinal concept of \"Al-Qaeda\" was first coined by the PalestinianIslamist scholar and Jihadist leader Abdullah Azzam in an April 1988 issue of Al-Jihad magazine to describe a religiously committed vanguard of Muslims who wage armed Jihad globally to liberate oppressed Muslims from foreign invaders, establish sharia (Islamic law) across the Islamic World by overthrowing the ruling secular governments; and thus restore the past Islamic prowess. This was to be implemented by establishing an Islamic state that would nurture generations of Muslim soldiers that would perpetually attack United States and its allied governments in the Muslim World. Numerous historical models were cited by Azzam as successful examples of his call; starting from the early Muslim conquests of the 7th century to the recent anti-SovietAfghan Jihad of 1980s.[165][166][167] According to Azzam's world-view:\nIt is about time to think about a state that would be a solid base for the distribution of the (Islamic) creed, and a fortress to host the preachers from the hell of the Jahiliyyah [the pre-Islamic period].[167]\nBin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with Al Jazeera journalist Tayseer Alouni in October 2001:\nThe name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia's terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.[168]\nIt has been argued that two documents seized from the Sarajevo office of the Benevolence International Foundation prove the name was not simply adopted by the mujahideen movement and that a group called Al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term \"Al-Qaeda\".[169]\nFormer British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote that the word Al-Qaeda should be translated as \"the database\", because it originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.[170] In April 2002, the group assumed the name Qa'idat al-Jihad (\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062fq\u0101\u02bfidat al-jih\u0101d), which means \"the base of Jihad\". According to Diaa Rashwan, this was \"apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's al-Jihad, which was led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.\"[171]\nThe militant IslamistSalafist movement of Al-Qaeda developed during the Islamic revival and the rise of the Islamist movement after the Iranian Revolution (1978\u20131979) and the Afghan Jihad (1979\u20131989). Many scholars have argued that the writings of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb inspired the Al-Qaeda organization.[172] In the 1950s and 1960s, Qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, and had reverted to the pre-Islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah. To restore Islam, Qutb argued that a vanguard of righteous Muslims was needed in order to establish \"true Islamic states\", implement sharia, and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences. In Qutb's view, the enemies of Islam included \"world Jewry\", which \"plotted conspiracies\" and opposed Islam.[173] Qutb envisioned this vanguard to march forward to wage armed Jihad against tyrannical regimes after purifying from the wider Jahili societies and organising themselves under a righteous Islamic leadership; which he viewed as the model of early Muslims in the Islamic state of Medina under the leadership of Islamic Prophet Muhammad. This idea would directly influence many Islamist figures such as Abdullah Azzam and Usama Bin Laden; and became the core rationale for the formulation of \"Al-Qaeda\" concept in the near future.[174] Outlining his strategy to topple the existing secular orders, Qutb argued in Milestones:\n[It is necessary that] a Muslim community to come into existence which believes that \u2018there is no deity except God,\u2019 which commits itself to obey none but God, denying all other authority, and which challenges the legality of any law which is not based on this belief.. . It should come into the battlefield with the determination that its strategy, its social organization, and the relationship between its individuals should be firmer and more powerful than the existing jahili system.[174][175]\nIslam is different from any other religion; it's a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.[176]\nQutb also influenced Ayman al-Zawahiri.[177] Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, prot\u00e9g\u00e9, personal lawyer, and an executor of his estate. Azzam was one of the last people to see Qutb alive before his execution.[178] Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet's Banner.[179]\nQutb argued that many Muslims were not true Muslims. Some Muslims, Qutb argued, were apostates. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce sharia law.[180] He also alleged that the West approaches the Muslim World with a \"crusading spirit\"; in spite of the decline of religious values in the 20th century Europe. According to Qutb; the hostile and imperialist attitudes exhibited by Europeans and Americans towards Muslim countries, their support for Zionism, etc. reflected hatred amplified over a millennia of wars such as the Crusades and was born out of Romanmaterialist and utilitarian outlooks that viewed the world in monetary terms.[181]\nSayyid Ahmed's revival of the ideology of jihad became the prototype for subsequent Islamic militant movements in South and Central Asia and is also the main influence over the jihad network of Al Qaeda and its associated groups in the region.[183][184]\nThe long-term objective of Al-Qaeda is to unite the Muslim World under a supra-national Islamic state known as the Khilafah (Caliphate), headed by an elected Caliph descended from the Ahl al-Bayt (Prophetic family). The immediate objectives include the expulsion of American troops from the Arabian Peninsula, waging armed Jihad to topple US-allied governments in the region, etc.[185][186]\nThe following are the goals and some of the general policies outlined in Al-Qaeda's Founding Charter \"Al-Qaeda's Structure and Bylaws\" issued in the meetings in Peshawar in 1988.:[187][185]\n\"General Goals\ni. To promote jihad awareness in the Islamic world\nii. To prepare and equip the cadres for the Islamic world through trainings and by participating in actual combat\niii. To support and sponsor the jihad movement as much as possible\niv. To coordinate Jihad movements around the world in an effort to create a unified international Jihad movement.\nGeneral Policies\n1. Complete commitment to the governing rules and controls of Shari\u2018a in all the beliefs and actions and according to the book [Qur\u2019an] and Sunna as well as per the interpretation of the nation\u2019s scholars who serve in this domain\n2. Commitment to Jihad as a fight for God\u2019s cause and as an agenda of change and to prepare for it and apply it whenever we find it possible...\n4. Our position with respect to the tyrants of the world, secular and national parties and the like is not to associate with them, to discredit them and to be their constant enemy till they believe in God alone. We shall not agree with them on half-solutions and there is no way to negotiate with them or appease them\n5. Our relationships with truthful Islamic jihadist movements and groups is to cooperate under the umbrella of faith and belief and we shall always attempt to at uniting and integrating with them...\n6. We shall carry a relationship of love and affection with the Islamic movements who are not aligned with Jihad...\n7. We shall sustain a relationship of respect and love with active scholars...\n9. We shall reject the regional fanatics and will pursue Jihad in an Islamic country as needed and when possible\n10. We shall care about the role of Muslim people in the Jihad and we shall attempt to recruit them...\n11. We shall maintain our economic independence and will not rely on others to secure our resources.\n12. Secrecy is the main ingredient of our work except for what the need deems necessary to reveal\n13. our policy with the Afghani Jihad is support, advise and coordination with the Islamic Establishments in Jihad arenas in a manner that conforms with our policies\"\nAl-Qaeda aims to establish an Islamic state in the Arab World, modelled after the Rashidun Caliphate, by initiating a global Jihad against the \"International Jewish-Crusader Alliance\" led by the United States, which it sees as the \"external enemy\" and against the secular governments in Muslim countries, that are described as \"the apostate domestic enemy\".[189] Once foreign influences and the secular ruling authorities are removed from Muslim countries through Jihad; al-Qaeda supports elections to choose the rulers of its proposed Islamic states. This is to be done through representatives of leadership councils (Shura) that would ensure the implementation of Shari'a (Islamic law). However, it opposes elections that institute parliaments which empower Muslim and non-Muslim legislators to collaborate in making laws of their own choosing.[190] In the second edition of his book Knights Under the Banner of the Prophet, Ayman Al Zawahiri writes:\nWe demand... the government of the rightly guiding caliphate, which is established on the basis of the sovereignty of sharia and not on the whims of the majority. Its ummah chooses its rulers....If they deviate, the ummah brings them to account and removes them. The ummah participates in producing that government's decisions and determining its direction. ... [The caliphal state] commands the right and forbids the wrong and engages in jihad to liberate Muslim lands and to free all humanity from all oppression and ignorance.[191]\nWhile the leadership's own theological platform is essentially Salafi, the organization's umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings. Al-Qaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with Wahhabism, Shafi'ism, Malikism, and Hanafism. There are even some Al-Qaeda members whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with Salafism, such as Yunis Khalis, one of the leaders of the Afghan mujahedin. He was a mystic who visited the tombs of saints and sought their blessings \u2013 practices inimical to bin Laden's Wahhabi-Salafi school of thought. The only exception to this pan-Islamic policy is Shi'ism. Al-Qaeda seems implacably opposed to it, as it holds Shi'ism to be heresy. In Iraq it has openly declared war on the Badr Brigades, who have fully cooperated with the US, and now considers even Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence.[193]\nOn the other hand, Professor Peter Mandaville states that Al-Qaeda follows a pragmatic policy in forming its local affiliates, with various cells being sub-contracted to Shia Muslim and non-Muslim members. The top-down chain of command means that each unit is answerable directly to central leadership, while they remain ignorant of their counterparts' presence or activities. These transnational networks of autonomous supply chains, financiers, underground militias and political supporters were set up during the 1990s, when Bin Laden's immediate aim was the expulsion of American troops from the Arabian Peninsula.[194]\nUnder the leadership of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda organization adopted the strategy of targeting non-combatant civilians of enemy states that indiscriminately attacked Muslims. Following the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, \"A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington\". According to a couple of critics, Quintan Wiktorowicz and John Kaltner, it provides \"ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation.\"[195]\nAmong these justifications are that America is leading the west in waging a War on Islam so that attacks on America are a defense of Islam and any treaties and agreements between Muslim majority states and Western countries that would be violated by attacks are null and void. According to the tract, several conditions allow for the killing of civilians including:\nretaliation for the American war on Islam which al-Qaeda alleges has targeted \"Muslim women, children and elderly\";\nwhen it is too difficult to distinguish between non-combatants and combatants when attacking an enemy \"stronghold\" (hist) and/or non-combatants remain in enemy territory, killing them is allowed;\nthose who assist the enemy \"in deed, word, mind\" are eligible for killing, and this includes the general population in democratic countries because civilians can vote in elections that bring enemies of Islam to power;\nthe necessity of killing in the war to protect Islam and Muslims;\nthe prophet Muhammad, when asked whether the Muslim fighters could use the catapult against the village of Taif, replied affirmatively, even though the enemy fighters were mixed with a civilian population;\nif the women, children and other protected groups serve as human shields for the enemy;\nif the enemy has broken a treaty, killing of civilians is permitted.[195]\nUnder the leadership of Sayf al-Adel, Al-Qaeda's strategy has underwent transformation and the organization has officially renounced the tactic of attacking civilian targets of enemies. In his book Free Reading of 33 Strategies of War published in 2023, Sayf al-Adel counselled Islamist fighters to prioritize attacking the police forces, military soldiers, state assets of enemy governments, etc. which he described as acceptable targets in military operations. Asserting that attacking women and children of enemies are contrary to Islamic values, Sayf al-Adel asked: \"If we target the general public, how can we expect their people to accept our call to Islam?\"[196]\nAl-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.[197]\nTo prevent the former Afghan king Mohammed Zahir Shah from coming back from exile and possibly becoming head of a new government, bin Laden instructed a Portuguese convert to Islam, Paulo Jose de Almeida Santos, to assassinate Zahir Shah. On November 4, 1991, Santos entered the king's villa in Rome posing as a journalist and tried to stab him with a dagger. A tin of cigarillos in the king's breast pocket deflected the blade and saved Zahir Shah's life. Santos was apprehended and jailed for 10 years in Italy.[198]\nOn December 29, 1992, Al-Qaeda launched the 1992 Yemen hotel bombings. Two bombs were detonated in Aden, Yemen. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.[199]\nThe bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, Operation Restore Hope. Internally, Al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the US, the attack was barely noticed. No American soldiers were killed because no soldiers were staying in the hotel at the time it was bombed, however, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker were killed in the bombing. Seven others, who were mostly Yemeni, were severely injured.[199] Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by Al-Qaeda's members, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by Ibn Taymiyyah, a 13th-century scholar admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.[200][unreliable source?]\nOn October 12, 2000, Al-Qaeda militants in Yemen bombed the missile destroyerUSS Cole in a suicide attack, killing 17 US servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, Al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the US itself.\nThe September 11 attacks on America by Al-Qaeda killed 2,996 people \u2013 2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel as well as 19 hijackers who committed murder-suicide. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the United States Capitol or the White House, crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers revolted. It was the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and to this day remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history.\nThe attacks were conducted by Al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the 1998 fatwa issued against the US and its allies by persons under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others.[26] Evidence points to suicide squads led by Al-Qaeda military commander Mohamed Atta as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Hambali as the key planners and part of the political and military command.\nMessages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001, praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement.[202] Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the US was actively oppressing Muslims.[203]\nBin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in \"Palestine, Chechnya, Kashmir and Iraq\" and Muslims should retain the \"right to attack in reprisal\". He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at people, but \"America's icons of military and economic power\", despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning when most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating the maximum number of human casualties.[204]\nEvidence later came to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the US East Coast. The targets were later altered by Al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack \"might get out of hand\".[205][206]\nIn the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government responded, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring Al-Qaeda. The US offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite Special Activities Division (SAD).\nThe Taliban offered to turn over bin Laden to a neutral country for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. US President George W. Bush responded by saying: \"We know he's guilty. Turn him over\",[246] and British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned the Taliban regime: \"Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power.\"[247]\nSoon thereafter the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the Afghan Northern Alliance removed the Taliban government as part of the war in Afghanistan. As a result of the US special forces and air support for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and Al-Qaeda training camps were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of Al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the Tora Bora area of Afghanistan, many Al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged Gardez region of the nation.\nBy early 2002, Al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared to be a success. Nevertheless, a significant Taliban insurgency remained in Afghanistan.\nDebate continued regarding the nature of Al-Qaeda's role in the 9/11 attacks. The US State Department released a videotape showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.[248] Although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people,[249] the tape definitively implicates bin Laden and Al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks. The tape was aired on many television channels, with an accompanying English translation provided by the US Defense Department.[250]\nIn September 2004, the 9/11 Commission officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives.[251] In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: \"As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.\"[252]\nAl-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, while supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.\nIslamist rebels in the Sahara calling themselves Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years.[258][259][260] French officials say the rebels have no real links to the Al-Qaeda leadership, but this has been disputed. It seems likely that bin Laden approved the group's name in late 2006, and the rebels \"took on the al Qaeda franchise label\", almost a year before the violence began to escalate.[261]\nIn Mali, the Ansar Dine faction was also reported as an ally of Al-Qaeda in 2013.[262] The Ansar al Dine faction aligned themselves with the AQIM.[263]\nBefore the 9/11 attacks and the US invasion of Afghanistan, westerners who had been recruits at Al-Qaeda training camps were sought after by Al-Qaeda's military wing. Language skills and knowledge of Western culture were generally found among recruits from Europe, such was the case with Mohamed Atta, an Egyptian national studying in Germany at the time of his training, and other members of the Hamburg Cell. Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atef would later designate Atta as the ringleader of the 9/11 hijackers. Following the attacks, Western intelligence agencies determined that Al-Qaeda cells operating in Europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in Afghanistan.[154][270]\nIn 2003, Islamists carried out a series of bombings in Istanbul killing fifty-seven people and injuring seven hundred. Seventy-four people were charged by the Turkish authorities. Some had previously met bin Laden, and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to Al-Qaeda they asked for its blessing and help.[271][272]\nFollowing Yemeni unification in 1990, Wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country. Although it is unlikely bin Laden or Saudi Al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the USS Cole bombing.[279] Concerns grew over al-Qaeda's group in Yemen.[280]\nIn Iraq, al-Qaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad group commanded by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Specializing in suicide operations, they have been a \"key driver\" of the Sunni insurgency.[281] Although they played a small part in the overall insurgency, between 30% and 42% of all suicide bombings which took place in the early years were claimed by Zarqawi's group.[282][283] Reports have indicated that oversights such as the failure to control access to the Qa'qaa munitions factory in Yusufiyah have allowed large quantities of munitions to fall into the hands of al-Qaida.[284] In November 2010, the militant group Islamic State of Iraq, which is linked to al-Qaeda in Iraq, threatened to \"exterminate all Iraqi Christians\".[285][286]\nAl-Qaeda did not begin training Palestinians until the late 1990s.[287] Large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have rejected an alliance with al-Qaeda, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their cells. This may have changed recently. The Israeli security and intelligence services believe al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for an opportunity to attack.[287]\nUS officials believe al-Qaeda was helping organize attacks in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.[302] Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan.[303] In 2006 al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir.[294][304] However Indian Army General H. S. Panag argued that the army had ruled out the presence of al-Qaeda in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. Panag also said al-Qaeda had strong ties with Kashmiri militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed based in Pakistan.[305] It has been noted that Waziristan has become a battlefield for Kashmiri militants fighting NATO in support of al-Qaeda and Taliban.[306][307][308]Dhiren Barot, who wrote the Army of Madinah in Kashmir[309] and was an al-Qaeda operative convicted for involvement in the 2004 financial buildings plot, had received training in weapons and explosives at a militant training camp in Kashmir.[310]\nLashkar-e-Taiba, a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 Mumbai attacks, is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan.[316] In late 2002, top Al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safe house in Faisalabad.[317] The FBI believes al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been 'intertwined' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba.[317]Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re told Reuters in 2009 that \"Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda. Lashkar-e-Taiba is a member of al-Qaeda.\"[318][319]\nIn a video released in 2008, American-born senior al-Qaeda operative Adam Yahiye Gadahn said that \"victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which, Allah willing, will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land.\"[320]\nIn January 2010, US Defense secretary Robert Gates, while on a visit to Pakistan, said that al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.[328]\nAl-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance. The group's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, with online activities that include financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, and information dissemination, gathering and sharing.[329]\nThe range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores. A website associated with Al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur Nick Berg being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of Paul Johnson, Kim Sun-il, and Daniel Pearl, were first posted on jihadist websites.[citation needed]\nIn December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to al Jazeera as he had done in the past. Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain they would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editing out anything critical of the Saudi royal family.[330]\nAlneda.com and Jehad.net were perhaps the most significant al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was initially taken down by American Jon Messner, but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content.[citation needed]\nThe US government charged a British information technology specialist, Babar Ahmad, with terrorist offences related to his operating a network of English-language al-Qaeda websites, such as Azzam.com. He was convicted and sentenced to 12+1\u20442 years in prison.[331][332][333]\nal-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including \"several Boeing 727 aircraft\", turboprops and executive jets, according to a 2010 Reuters story. Based on a US Department of Homeland Security report, the story said al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa. A Boeing 727 can carry up to ten tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly kidnapping Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities.[335]\nExperts debate the notion that the al-Qaeda attacks were an indirect consequence of the American CIA's Operation Cyclone program to help the Afghan mujahideen. Robin Cook, British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and bin Laden were \"a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies\", and that \"Al-Qaida, literally 'the database', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians.\"[339]\nThe strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.[340]\nCNN journalist Peter Bergen, Pakistani ISI Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as Vincent Cannistraro,[341] deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin Laden, or that they armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them. In his 2004 book Ghost Wars, Steve Coll writes that the CIA had contemplated providing direct support to the foreign mujahideen, but that the idea never moved beyond discussions.[342]\nBergen and others[who else?] argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight.[342][failed verification] Bergen further argues that foreign mujahideen had no need for American funds since they received several million dollars per year from internal sources. Lastly, he argues that Americans could not have trained the foreign mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan, and the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.\nAccording to Bergen, who conducted the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997: the idea that \"the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden... [is] a folk myth. There's no evidence of this... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.\"[343]\nJason Burke also wrote:\nSome of the $500 million the CIA poured into Afghanistan reached [Al-Zawahiri's] group. Al-Zawahiri has become a close aide of bin Laden... Bin Laden was only loosely connected with the [Hezb-i-Islami faction of the mujahideen led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar], serving under another Hezb-i-Islami commander known as Engineer Machmud. However, bin Laden's Office of Services, set up to recruit overseas for the war, received some US cash.[344]\nAnders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, was inspired by al-Qaeda, calling it \"the most successful revolutionary movement in the world.\" While admitting different aims, he sought to \"create a European version of Al-Qaida.\"[345][346]\nThe appropriate response to offshoots is a subject of debate. A journalist reported in 2012 that a senior US military planner had asked: \"Should we resort to drones and Special Operations raids every time some group raises the black banner of al Qaeda? How long can we continue to chase offshoots of offshoots around the world?\"[347]\nAccording to CNN journalists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank, a number of \"religious scholars, former fighters and militants\" who previously supported Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) had turned against the Al-Qaeda-supported Iraqi insurgency in 2008; due to ISI's indiscriminate attacks against civilians while targeting US-led coalition forces. American military analyst Bruce Riedel wrote in 2008 that \"a wave of revulsion\" arose against ISI, which enabled US-allied Sons of Iraq faction to turn various tribal leaders in the Anbar region against the Iraqi insurgency. In response, Bin Laden and Zawahiri issued public statements urging Muslims to rally behind ISI leadership and support the armed struggle against American forces.[348]\nIn response to Noman Benotman, a former militant member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007, after persuading the imprisoned senior leaders of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with Al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months after \"they were said to have renounced violence.\"[349]\nIn 2007, on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks,[350] the Saudi sheikh Salman al-Ouda delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. Al-Ouda addressed Al-Qaeda's leader on television asking him:\nMy brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?[351]\nAccording to Pew polls, support for Al-Qaeda had dropped in the Muslim world in the years before 2008.[352] In Saudi Arabia, only ten percent had a favorable view of Al-Qaeda, according to a December 2007 poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based think tank.[353]\nIn 2007, the imprisoned Dr. Fadl, who was an influential Afghan Arab and former associate of Ayman al-Zawahiri, withdrew his support from al-Qaeda and criticized the organization in his book Wathiqat Tarshid Al-'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w'Al-'Alam (English: Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World). In response, Al-Zawahiri accused Dr. Fadl of promoting \"an Islam without jihad\" that aligns with Western interests and wrote a nearly two hundred pages long treatise, titled \"The Exoneration\" which appeared on the Internet in March 2008. In his treatise, Zawahiri justified military strikes against US targets as retaliatory attacks to defend Muslim community against American aggression.[350]\nIn an online town hall forum conducted in December 2007, Zawahiri denied that al-Qaeda deliberately targeted innocents and accused the American coalition of killing innocent people.[354] Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 LIFG completed a new \"code\" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled \"Corrective Studies\". Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against Al-Qaeda, the LIFG's reversal may be an important step toward staunching Al-Qaeda's recruitment.[355]\nBilal Abdul Kareem, an American journalist based in Syria created a documentary about al-Shabab, Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia. The documentary included interviews with former members of the group who stated their reasons for leaving al-Shabab. The members made accusations of segregation, lack of religious awareness and internal corruption and favoritism. In response to Kareem, the Global Islamic Media Front condemned Kareem, called him a liar, and denied the accusations from the former fighters.[356]\nIn mid-2014 after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant declared that they had restored the Caliphate, an audio statement was released by the then-spokesman of the group Abu Muhammad al-Adnani claiming that \"the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the Caliphate's authority.\" The speech included a religious refutation of Al-Qaeda for being too lenient regarding Shiites and their refusal to recognize the authority Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, al-Adnani specifically noting: \"It is not suitable for a state to give allegiance to an organization.\" He also recalled a past instance in which Osama bin Laden called on Al-Qaeda members and supporters to give allegiance to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi when the group was still solely operating in Iraq, as the Islamic State of Iraq, and condemned Ayman al-Zawahiri for not making this same claim for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Zawahiri was encouraging factionalism and division between former allies of ISIL such as the al-Nusra Front.[357][358]\n^A. Geltzer, Joshua (2010). \"4: The al-Qaeda world view\".

Two months before 9/11, Zawahiri, who had become al Qaeda's second-in-command, published Knigbts Under the Banner of the Prophet, which offers insight into why al Qacda decided to attack the United States within its borders. In it, he stated that al Qaeda aimed to establish an Islamic state in the Arab world: Just as victory is not achieved for an army unless its foot soldiers occupy land, the mujahid lslamic movement will not achieve victory against the global infdel alliance unless it possesses a base in the heart of the Islamic world. Every plan and method we consider to rally and mobilize the ummab will be hanging in the air with no concrete result or tangible return unless it leads to the establishment of the caliphal state in the heart of the Islamic world. Achieving this goal, Zawahiri explained elsewhere in the book, would require a global jihad: It is not possible to incite a conflict for the establishment of a Muslim state if it is a regional conflict.... The international Jewish-Crusader alliance, led by America, will not allow any Muslim force to obtain power in any of the Muslim lands. ... It will impose sanctions on whoever helps it, even if it does not declare war against them altogether. Therefore, to adjust to this new reality, we must prepare ourselves for a battle that is not confined to a single region but rather includes the apostate domestic enemy and the Jewish-Crusader external enemy. To confront this insidious alliance, Zawahiri argued, al Qaeda had to first root out U.S. infuence in the region...\n^McCants, William (September 2011). \"Al Qaeda's Challenge: The Jihadists' War With Islamist Democrats\". Foreign Affairs. 90 (5): 20\u201332. JSTOR23041773 \u2013 via JSTOR. Zawahiri does not oppose all elections; for example, he supports elections for the rulers of Islamic states and for representatives on leadership councils, which would ensure that these governments implemented Islamic law properly. But he opposes any system in which elections empower legislators to make laws of their own choosing... Bin Laden agreed with Zawahiri's take on elections, stating in January 2009 that once foreign influence and local tyrants have been removed from Islamic countries, true Muslims can elect their own presidents. And like Zawahiri, bin Laden argued that elections should not create parliaments that allow Muslims and non-Muslims to collaborate on making laws.\n^Gunaratna 2002, p. 147: \"The Al Qaeda team included Abu Talha al-Sudani, Saif al-Islam el-Masry, Salem el-Masry, Saif al-Adel and other trainers, including Abu Jaffer el-Masry, the explosives expert who ran the Jihad Wal camp Afghanistan.

        "context": "\nThe seven non-eurozone members of the EU are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden. They continue to use their own national currencies, although all but Denmark are obliged to join once they meet the euro convergence criteria.[9] Among non-EU member states, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City have formal agreements with the EU to use the euro as their official currency and issue their own coins.[10][11][12]\nIn addition, Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro unilaterally.[13] These six countries, however, have no representation in any eurozone institution.[14]\nSince the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the eurozone has established and used provisions for granting emergency loans to member states in return for enacting economic reforms.[citation needed] The eurozone has also enacted some limited fiscal integration; for example, in peer review of each other's national budgets. The issue is political and in a state of flux in terms of what further provisions will be agreed for eurozone change. No eurozone member state has left, and there are no provisions to do so or to be expelled.[15]\nIn 1998, eleven member states of the European Union had met the euro convergence criteria, and the eurozone came into existence with the official launch of the euro (alongside national currencies) on 1 January 1999 in those countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece qualified in 2000 and was admitted on 1 January 2001.\nThese twelve founding members introduced physical euro banknotes and euro coins on 1 January 2002. After a short transition period, they took out of circulation and rendered invalid their pre-euro national coins and notes.\nBetween 2007 and 2023, eight new states have acceded: Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\nThe euro is also used in countries outside the EU. Four states (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) have signed formal agreements with the EU to use the euro and issue their own coins.[28][29] Nevertheless, they are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB and do not have a seat in the ECB or Euro Group.\nAkrotiri and Dhekelia (located on the island of Cyprus) belong to the United Kingdom, but there are agreements between the UK and Cyprus[citation needed] and between UK and EU[citation needed] about their partial integration with Cyprus and partial adoption of Cypriot law, including the usage of euro in Akrotiri and Dhekelia.[citation needed]\nKosovo and Montenegro officially adopted the euro as their sole currency without an agreement and, therefore, have no issuing rights.[29] These states are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB. However, sometimes the term eurozone is applied to all territories that have adopted the euro as their sole currency.[30][31][32] Further unilateral adoption of the euro (euroisation), by both non-euro EU and non-EU members, is opposed by the ECB and EU.[33]\nThe chart below provides a full summary of all applying exchange-rate regimes for EU members, since the birth, on 13 March 1979, of the European Monetary System with its Exchange Rate Mechanism and the related new common currency ECU. On 1 January 1999, the euro replaced the ECU 1:1 at the exchange rate markets. During 1979\u20131999, the D-Mark functioned as a de facto anchor for the ECU, meaning there was only a minor difference between pegging a currency against the ECU and pegging it against the D-Mark.\nThe eurozone was born with its first 11 member states on 1 January 1999. The first enlargement of the eurozone, to Greece, took place on 1 January 2001, one year before the euro physically entered into circulation. The next enlargements were to states which joined the EU in 2004, and then joined the eurozone on 1 January of the year noted: Slovenia in 2007, Cyprus in 2008, Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015. Croatia, which acceded to the EU in 2013, adopted the euro in 2023.\nAll new EU members joining the bloc after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 are obliged to adopt the euro under the terms of their accession treaties. However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria which need first to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion, which requires having been an ERM-member for a minimum of two years without the presence of \"severe tensions\" for the currency exchange rate.\nIn September 2011, a diplomatic source close to the euro adoption preparation talks with the seven remaining new member states who had yet to adopt the euro at that time (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania), claimed that the monetary union (eurozone) they had thought they were going to join upon their signing of the accession treaty may very well end up being a very different union, entailing a much closer fiscal, economic, and political convergence than originally anticipated. This changed legal status of the eurozone could potentially cause them to conclude that the conditions for their promise to join were no longer valid, which \"could force them to stage new referendums\" on euro adoption.[34]\nBefore joining the eurozone, a state must spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II). As of January 2023[update], the Danish central bank and the Bulgarian central bank participate in ERM II.\nDenmark obtained a special opt-out in the original Maastricht Treaty, and thus is legally exempt from joining the eurozone unless its government decides otherwise, either by parliamentary vote or referendum. The United Kingdom likewise had an opt-out prior to withdrawing from the EU in 2020.\nThe remaining six countries are obliged to adopt the euro in future, although the EU has so far not tried to enforce any time plan. They should join as soon as they fulfill the convergence criteria, which include being part of ERM II for two years. Sweden, which joined the EU in 1995 after the Maastricht Treaty was signed, is required to join the eurozone. However, the Swedish people turned down euro adoption in a 2003 referendum and since then the country has intentionally avoided fulfilling the adoption requirements by not joining ERM II, which is voluntary.[35][36] Bulgaria joined ERM II on 10 July 2020.[37]\nInterest in joining the eurozone increased in Denmark, and initially in Poland, as a result of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. In Iceland, there was an increase in interest in joining the European Union, a pre-condition for adopting the euro.[38] However, by 2010 the debt crisis in the eurozone caused interest from Poland, as well as the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden to cool.[39]\nIn the opinion of journalist Leigh Phillips and Locke Lord's Charles Proctor,[40][41] there is no provision in any European Union treaty for an exit from the eurozone. In fact, they argued, the Treaties make it clear that the process of monetary union was intended to be \"irreversible\" and \"irrevocable\".[41] However, in 2009, a European Central Bank legal study argued that, while voluntary withdrawal is legally not possible, expulsion remains \"conceivable\".[42] Although an explicit provision for an exit option does not exist, many experts and politicians in Europe have suggested an option to leave the eurozone should be included in the relevant treaties.[43]\nOn the issue of leaving the eurozone, the European Commission has stated that \"[t]he irrevocability of membership in the euro area is an integral part of the Treaty framework and the Commission, as a guardian of the EU Treaties, intends to fully respect [that irrevocability].\"[44] It added that it \"does not intend to propose [any] amendment\" to the relevant Treaties, the current status being \"the best way going forward to increase the resilience of euro area Member States to potential economic and financial crises.[44] The European Central Bank, responding to a question by a Member of the European Parliament, has stated that an exit is not allowed under the Treaties.[45]\nLikewise there is no provision for a state to be expelled from the euro.[46] Some, however, including the Dutch government, favour the creation of an expulsion provision for the case whereby a heavily indebted state in the eurozone refuses to comply with an EU economic reform policy.[47]\nIn a Texas law journal, University of Texas at Austin law professor Jens Dammann has argued that even now EU law contains an implicit right for member states to leave the eurozone if they no longer meet the criteria that they had to meet in order to join it.[48] Furthermore, he has suggested that, under narrow circumstances, the European Union can expel member states from the eurozone.[49]\nThe monetary policy of all countries in the eurozone is managed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem which comprises the ECB and the central banks of the EU states who have joined the eurozone. Countries outside the eurozone are not represented in these institutions. Whereas all EU member states are part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), non EU member states have no say in all three institutions, even those with monetary agreements such as Monaco. The ECB is entitled to authorise the design and printing of euro banknotes and the volume of euro coins minted, and its president is currently Christine Lagarde.\nThe eurozone is represented politically by its finance ministers, known collectively as the Eurogroup, and is presided over by a president, currently Paschal Donohoe. The finance ministers of the EU member states that use the euro meet a day before a meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) of the Council of the European Union. The Group is not an official Council formation but when the full EcoFin council votes on matters only affecting the eurozone, only Euro Group members are permitted to vote on it.[50][51][52]\nSince the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the Euro Group has met irregularly not as finance ministers, but as heads of state and government (like the European Council). It is in this forum, the Euro summit, that many eurozone reforms have been decided upon. In 2011, former French PresidentNicolas Sarkozy pushed for these summits to become regular and twice a year in order for it to be a 'true economic government'.[citation needed]\nIn April 2008 in Brussels, future European CommissionPresidentJean-Claude Juncker suggested that the eurozone should be represented at the IMF as a bloc, rather than each member state separately: \"It is absurd for those 15 countries not to agree to have a single representation at the IMF. It makes us look absolutely ridiculous. We are regarded as buffoons on the international scene\".[53] In 2017 Juncker stated that he aims to have this agreed by the end of his mandate in 2019.[54] However, Finance CommissionerJoaqu\u00edn Almunia stated that before there is common representation, a common political agenda should be agreed upon.[53]\nLeading EU figures including the commission and national governments have proposed a variety of reforms to the eurozone's architecture; notably the creation of a Finance Minister, a larger eurozone budget, and reform of the current bailout mechanisms into either a \"European Monetary Fund\" or a eurozone Treasury. While many have similar themes, details vary greatly.[55][56][57][58]\nThe 20 largest economies in the world including eurozone as a single entity, by nominal GDP (2020) at their peak level of GDP in billions US$. The values for EU members that are not also eurozone members are listed both separately and as part of the EU.[60]\nInterest rates for the eurozone, set by the ECB since 1999.[62] Levels are in percentages per annum. Between June 2000 and October 2008, the main refinancing operations were variable rate tenders, as opposed to fixed rate tenders. The figures indicated in the table from 2000 to 2008 refer to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.[4]\nComparison of government surplus/deficit (2001\u20132012) of eurozone, United States and United Kingdom\nThe primary means for fiscal coordination within the EU lies in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which are written for every member state, but with particular reference to the 20 current members of the eurozone. These guidelines are not binding, but are intended to represent policy coordination among the EU member states, so as to take into account the linked structures of their economies.\nFor their mutual assurance and stability of the currency, members of the eurozone have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, which sets agreed limits on deficits and national debt, with associated sanctions for deviation. The Pact originally set a limit of 3% of GDP for the yearly deficit of all eurozone member states; with fines for any state which exceeded this amount. In 2005, Portugal, Germany, and France had all exceeded this amount, but the Council of Ministers had not voted to fine those states. Subsequently, reforms were adopted to provide more flexibility and ensure that the deficit criteria took into account the economic conditions of the member states, and additional factors.\nOlivier Blanchard suggests that a fiscal union in the eurozone can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the eurozone peripheral countries. But he adds that the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the eurozone peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, they are forced to adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.[71]\nThe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 prompted a number of reforms in the eurozone. One was a U-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy that led to the creation of a specific fund to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However, the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the EU treaties. Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a permanent treaty basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article 136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.\nIn February 2016, the UK secured further confirmation that countries that do not use the Euro would not be required to contribute to bailouts for eurozone countries.[72]\nIn June 2010, a broad agreement was finally reached on a controversial proposal for member states to peer review each other's budgets prior to their presentation to national parliaments. Although showing the entire budget to each other was opposed by Germany, Sweden and the UK, each government would present to their peers and the Commission their estimates for growth, inflation, revenue and expenditure levels six months before they go to national parliaments. If a country was to run a deficit, they would have to justify it to the rest of the EU while countries with a debt more than 60% of GDP would face greater scrutiny.[73]\nThe plans would apply to all EU members, not just the eurozone, and have to be approved by EU leaders along with proposals for states to face sanctions before they reach the 3% limit in the Stability and Growth Pact. Poland has criticised the idea of withholding regional funding for those who break the deficit limits, as that would only impact the poorer states.[73] In June 2010 France agreed to back Germany's plan for suspending the voting rights of members who breach the rules.[74] In March 2011 was initiated a new reform of the Stability and Growth Pact aiming at straightening the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the deficit or the debt rules.[75][76]\nIn 1997, Arnulf Baring expressed concern that the European Monetary Union would make Germans the most hated people in Europe. Baring suspected the possibility that the people in Mediterranean countries would regard Germans and the currency bloc as economic policemen.[77]\nIn 2001, James Tobin thought that the euro project would not succeed without making drastic changes to European institutions, pointing out the difference between the US and the eurozone.[78] Concerning monetary policies, the system of Federal Reserve banks in the US aims at both growth and reducing unemployment, while the ECB tends to give its first priority to price stability under the Bundesbank's supervision. As the price level of the currency bloc is kept low, the unemployment level of the region has become higher than that of the US since 1982.[78] Concerning fiscal policies, 12% of the US federal budget is used for transfers to states and local governments. The US government does not impose restrictions on state budget policies, whereas the Treaty of Maastricht requires each eurozone member country to keep its budget deficit below 3% of its GDP.[78]\nThe eurozone has also been criticized for deepening inequality in Europe, particularly between the richest and poorest countries.[83] According to a study by Bertelsmann Stiftung, countries such as Austria and the Netherlands benefited significantly from the common currency, while southern and eastern European members of the eurozone gained very little,[84] and some countries are considered to have suffered adverse effects from adopting the euro.[85] In an article for the Politico, Joseph Stiglitz argues: \"The result for the eurozone has been slower growth, and especially for the weaker countries within it. The euro was supposed to usher in greater prosperity, which in turn would lead to renewed commitment to European integration. It has done just the opposite \u2014 increasing divisions within the EU, especially between creditor and debtor countries.\"[85] Matthias Matthijs believes that the euro resulted in a \"winner-take-all\" economy, as national income differences between eurozone members have widened further.[86] He argues that countries such as Austria and Germany have gained from the eurozone at the expense of southern countries like Italy and Spain.[86]\nBy adopting the euro and abandoning their national currencies, eurozone countries gave up their ability to conduct independent monetary policy; as such, monetary policies used to combat recession, such as monetary stimulus or currency devaluation, are no longer available.[86] During the European debt crisis, several eurozone countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus) were unable to repay their debt without third-party intervention by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.[87] In order to grant the bailout, the ECB and the IMF forced the affected countries to adopt strict austerity measures.[86] The European bailouts were largely about shifting exposure from banks onto European taxpayers,[88][89][90] and exacerbated issues such as high unemployment and poverty.[91][92]\nIn 2019, a study from the Centre for European Policy concluded that while some countries had gained from adopting the euro, several countries were poorer than they would have been had they not adopted it, with France and Italy being particularly affected.[93][94] The publication prompted a large number of reactions, pushing its authors to put out a statement clarifying some points.[95] In 2020, a study from the University of Bonn reached a different conclusion: the adoption of the euro made \u201csome mild losers (France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal) and a clear winner (Ireland)\u201d.[96] Both studies used the synthetic control method to estimate what might have happened if the euro hadn't been adopted.\n^Includes the population of Croatia, even though it was not a eurozone member in 2021.\n^The ECB announced on 22 December 1998 that, between 4 and 21 January 1999, there would be a narrow corridor of 50 basis points interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility in order to help the transition to the ECB's interest regime.",

        "context": "\nMichael Colin Smith was born 18 September 1990 to parents Ian and Sandra. Smith lived in Cherry Tree Drive, Parr, St Helens throughout his childhood and attended St Cuthbert's High School nearby. When he was 15, he fell off his bike on the way to school breaking his hip, which required him to use crutches for 16 weeks. During that period, Smith threw his first 180 while on crutches. After leaving school, he took a joinery course at college, but he decided to drop out with one exam remaining to play in a darts tournament instead, a decision that he has described as the best of his life.[2] He was a regular winner of local darts events and made his debut in a PDC major at the 2009 UK Open where he lost 6\u20135 to Dave Ladley in the first round.[3]\nSmith's position on the ProTour Order of Merit also saw him qualify for the 2013 World Championship,[17] as he took the second of sixteen places that were awarded to the highest non-qualified players.[18] However, he ran into an in-form Raymond van Barneveld in the first round who averaged 108.31 as Smith could only win one leg during the match in a 0\u20133 defeat.[19]\nSmith reached the final of the third UK Open Qualifier in March, but was beaten 2\u20136 by Michael van Gerwen.[20]\nSmith won the 2013 PDC World Youth Championship with a 6\u20131 victory over Ricky Evans, which was broadcast just before the 2013 Premier League Darts Final. Smith led van Barneveld 3\u20130 in the third round of the UK Open but went on to lose 8\u20139.[21] In October, he advanced to the semi-finals for the second time in 2013 at the 12th Players Championship but his run was ended with a 6\u20133 defeat to Kevin Painter.[22] His youth title earned him a place in the Grand Slam of Darts and he produced an impressive display in his first group match against Dave Chisnall as from 3\u20131 down he hit legs of 11, 12, 14, and 13 darts to win 5\u20133 with an average of 103.17.[23] However, he then lost 5\u20132 to Scott Waites and 5\u20131 to Ted Hankey to finish third in Group H and be eliminated from the tournament.[24]\nSmith broke into the world's top 32 on the Order of Merit just before the cut-off for the 2014 World Championship to qualify through the main ranking list for the first time.[25] He beat Morihiro Hashimoto 3\u20131 in the first round.[26]\nHe then defeated reigning and 16-time world champion Phil Taylor 4\u20133 in the second round, taking out the bullseye on a 128 finish to win the match.[27] In the next round, Smith hit a 136 finish, with his opponent Peter Wright waiting on 41, to lead 3\u20132 but only won one more leg after this to lose 4\u20133.[28] He was named the PDC's Young Player of the Year at the Annual Awards in January.[29] Smith won through to the final of the sixth UK Open Qualifier of the year but averaged just 70.94 as he was whitewashed 6\u20130 by Michael van Gerwen.[30] A rematch against Wright followed in the third round of the UK Open with Smith throwing for the match in the final leg, but he missed a total of seven darts at doubles to lose 9\u20138.[31] His second final of 2014 was at the fifth Players Championship, which he reached by beating Raymond van Barneveld 6\u20133 in the quarter-finals and Gary Anderson 6\u20134 in the semis, but he was again whitewashed in the decider, this time by Brendan Dolan.[32]\nAfter seeing off Mensur Suljovi\u0107 3\u20131 in the first round of the 2015 World Championship, Smith beat Brendan Dolan 4\u20132 after having been 2\u20130 down, to set up a third round tie with fellow St. Helens player Stephen Bunting.[40] Despite taking out checkouts of 170 and 132, Smith was 3\u20130 down, before finding his scoring game to restrict Bunting to one leg as he closed the gap to 3\u20132. Ultimately his slow start to the match proved costly as he lost the next set to be knocked out 4\u20132 in a game that saw each player average 102 and hit eight 180s apiece.[41] Smith won the fifth UK Open Qualifier by beating Adrian Lewis 6\u20135.[42] A rematch with Bunting followed in the third round of the UK Open, with Smith missing two match darts in the deciding leg to be beaten 9\u20138.[43] He claimed the second European Tour title of his career by winning the International Darts Open with a 6\u20133 victory over Benito van de Pas in the final.[44] Smith suffered a 10\u20134 defeat to Gerwyn Price in the first round of the World Matchplay, but retained his European Darts Trophy title by seeing off Michael van Gerwen in the final for the second year in a row.[45] At the World Grand Prix, he punished two missed match darts from Price to beat him 2\u20131, but Smith then lost from 2\u20130 up in sets against Jamie Lewis in the second round.[46] Wins over Wayne Jones, Lewis and Andy Fordham saw Smith top his group at the Grand Slam and he then averaged 104.59 to beat Dave Chisnall 10\u20137 and reach the quarter-finals. Smith's first major event semi-final soon followed as he defeated Lewis 16\u201311, but he was heavily beaten 16\u20136 by Van Gerwen.[47][48]\nAt the 2016 World Championship wins over Jeffrey de Zwaan, Steve Beaton, and Benito van de Pas saw Smith reach the quarter-finals for the first time, where he was 3\u20130 ahead of Raymond van Barneveld.[49] He could only win two legs as Van Barneveld moved 4\u20133 up, but he took the next to take the match to a ninth and final set. Smith finished 130 on double five to move within a leg of the match and missed one dart to win it, before Van Barneveld won four legs in a row to end Smith's event.[50] Smith made his debut in the Premier League after receiving a wildcard from the PDC.[51] On the opening night, he played twice due to Gary Anderson being ill. Smith lost his first matches 7\u20132 to Peter Wright and 7\u20131 to Adrian Lewis. His first point came in week three courtesy of a 6\u20136 draw with Dave Chisnall. Michael van Gerwen scored a world record three-dart average of 123.40 against Smith in a 7\u20131 win, but the following week, Smith got his first Premier League victory by beating Van Barneveld 7\u20135.[52] However, Smith lost his last two matches to finish bottom of the table and be eliminated from the event.[53]\nSmith entered the 2017 World Championship without a match win since September 2016 having lost 10 in a row. He took the deciding set of his first round match with Ricky Evans without dropping a leg and said he had been \"fighting his demons\" recently.[57] In the next round, he missed five darts to eliminate Mervyn King 4\u20131, but kept his composure to eventually see him off 4\u20133.[58] Smith went 3\u20131 up on James Wade in the third round, but after Wade took the next set, Smith lost six legs in a row to be eliminated 4\u20133.[59] He missed two darts to win the third UK Open Qualifier as Peter Wright beat him 6\u20135.[60] Four 6\u20135 wins saw him reach the final of the Gibraltar Darts Trophy and at 4\u20134 he took out a 132 finish with Mensur Suljovi\u0107 waiting on 56 to break throw and took home his first title in nearly two years with a 6\u20134 victory.[61] Smith qualified for the 2017 European Championship as third seed, losing in the quarter-final to Rob Cross.[62]\nSmith began his 2022 World Championship campaign with a comfortable 3\u20130 win over Ron Meulenkamp, before defeating William O'Connor 4\u20132. The next two games saw him take on two of the most in-form players from the 2021 season; first defeating Jonny Clayton in a last-set shootout that went to extra legs; and then triumphing over defending champion Gerwyn Price, surviving two match darts before winning the final set. In the semi-final Smith took an early lead over James Wade and eventually triumphed 6\u20133, reaching the final for the second time in his career.[77] Smith lost the final 7\u20135 to Peter Wright and claimed \u00a3200,000 as runner-up.\nSmith reached the final of the UK Open in March, but lost 11\u201310 to Danny Noppert despite Noppert only averaging 84.82 to see his 7th final defeat. He recovered well to win a night event on the final standard night of the 2022 Premier League, but came 7th in the table and did not qualify for the playoff places. His good form after the UK Open continued, winning 3 Pro Tour titles in a short period and performing well in the European Tour.\nSmith opened his 2023 World Championship campaign with a 3\u20130 win over Nathan Rafferty. In the third round Smith came from 3\u20131 down to beat Martin Schindler 4\u20133, before beating Joe Cullen and Stephen Bunting to reach the semi-finals. In the semi-final Smith beat Gabriel Clemens 6\u20132 to reach his third World Championship final.\nIn the final, Smith hit a nine dart finish only seconds after Michael van Gerwen missed Double 12 for his own nine darter.[80]\nAfter a back and forth match, Smith broke van Gerwen's throw and held his own throw to lead 6\u20133. After losing the tenth set and going two down in the eleventh set, Smith won two legs in a row to throw for the match. Smith finished in eleven darts to win 7\u20134 and become world champion for the first time and move up to world number one in the PDC Order of Merit for the first time. He also became the first player to win both the PDC World Youth Championship and the PDC World Darts Championship.[81]",

        "context": "\nThe Voice is an American singing reality competition television series broadcast on NBC. It premiered during the spring television cycle on April 26, 2011. Based on the original The Voice of Holland and part of the Voice franchise, it has aired 23 seasons and aims to find unsigned singing talent (solo or duets, professional and amateur) contested by aspiring singers drawn from public auditions. Singers must be at least thirteen years of age to compete.[2]\nEach season begins with the \"Blind Auditions\", where coaches form their team of artists whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The number of artists varies per season, with a set range between 8 and 16 artists. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read \"I want you.\" At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects their coach if more than one coach expresses interest.[6] Introduced in the 14th season is \"Block\", which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestant.\nIn the \"Battle Rounds\", each coach pairs two of their team members to perform together, then chooses one to advance in the competition. Each coach are assisted by different celebrity advisors varies each season. In season one, coaches sit alongside their respective advisors in the battle stage; however, the advisors no longer join the coaches in the battle stage starting season two. In season 23, there are no advisors and its coach assumed the duties for advising the artists alone. Season three introduced \"steals\", allowing each coach to save/select individuals who were eliminated during a battle round by another coach. First seen in the eighth season, artists are either given a walkover or is reassigned to a three-way battle in the event of another artist withdrawing from the competition if each coach sees fit. Saves were also added starting Season 14, which lets a coach prevent someone that they eliminated on their team from going home; in Season 23, Saves are replaced with \"Playoff Pass\" (based on the Battle Pass from the Australian version) which allow one artist to exempt them from participating in the Knockouts and directly advance to the Playoffs (the other artist advancing to the Knockouts as usual).\nThe Knockout Rounds were also introduced in season three (except for seasons six and sixteen). A pair of artists within a team are selected to sing individual performances in succession. They are not told until a few minutes prior to their performances who their partner is. The artists get to choose their own songs in this round, although they continue to get help and advice from their respective coaches, and since season six, a celebrity advisor serving as a mega mentor (except seasons 14 and 22). At the conclusion of the performances, coaches would decide which one of each pair gets to advance to the next round.[6] Similar to the battle rounds, the coaches can steal one eliminated artist from another coach starting with season five. Starting in season 14, coaches can save one eliminated artist from their own team. From season 18 till 20, artists who were saved faced a Four-Way Knockout, with the winner decided through a public vote.[7]\nThe \"Battles, Round 2\" were introduced to replace the Knockout Rounds in season six.[6] Similar to the Knockout Rounds, each singer is paired within their team. One celebrity key adviser also assists all four of the coaches and their teams in preparation of these rounds. Coaches give each Battle pairing a list of songs and each pair must agree on which song to sing.[8] Like the first Battle round, each coach can still decide which of their singers in each pair will advance to the next round, and also allowed one steal.[9]\nIn the sixteenth season, the knockouts were replaced by The Live Cross Battles, a format identical to the Cross Battles from the Chinese version of The Voice. Each coach selects an artist to perform with another coach's artist together. The artist that receives the public vote will move on to the Playoffs, while the losing artist may be eliminated from the competition. The Live Cross Battles did not return in season seventeen due to poor reception.[10]\nPreviously eliminated artists can also advance to compete in the live shows; between seasons nine and thirteen (except season 11), each coach saved one artist (from either the Battle or Knockout rounds) to put through to the Live Playoffs. For seasons 15, 16 and 20, selected singers (prior to the Live elimination rounds) are put through to the \"Comeback Stage\" (which would be mentored by a fifth coach) and competed in a series of duels for a place in the live shows, with the winner earning a right to join a team of their choice. Season 21 added \"Voice Comeback\" where each coach picked one artist to compete in a Twitter poll, and only one artist with the most votes moves on.\nIn the final live performance phase of the competition (playoffs and elimination rounds), artists perform in weekly shows, where public voting narrows to a final group of artists and eventually declares a winner.[6]\nUnder the current format since season three in favor on a more competitive standard previously seen on other similar reality shows, any artists, regardless of each team, who earned the lowest number of votes were progressively eliminated each week until five artists remain (three until season 6, then four prior to season 17), hence introducing a possibility where at least one coach would not represent a single artist in the finale.\nPrior to season three, the coaches have the power to save one artist that had not received the public's vote that week, and as of season two, \"last chance performance\" are added where artists performed an additional song to vie for their coach's save, or other twists employed such as \"instant elimination\", where an artist faced immediate elimination without going through a public vote. However, in deciding who moves on to the final four phase, the television audience and the coaches have equal say. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale, where the outcome is decided solely by public vote. Season 18-20 temporarily reverted this format allowing each coach to guarantee at least one artist advancing in the finale to accommodate the short number of live shows at three weeks,[11] but these changes were reversed on Season 21 by reverting to the regular elimination format while retaining the top five finalists.[12]\nIn a first for a music competition series, NBC and Universal Republic Records offered fans of the show the ability to vote for their favorite artists by purchasing the studio versions of the songs that they perform on the live show each week via the iTunes Store. Alternative methods of voting can be done through toll-free phone calls (until season 8), text messaging, \"The Voice Official App on NBC\" app, and online votes via NBC.com and Facebook. Each method is limited to ten votes per user, and voting lasts until noon EST the next day.\nFrom the top 12 results show of season 3 to the end of season 17, a rule regarding voting was enacted with regard to iTunes singles purchases. In the first two seasons, voting via iTunes purchases of contestant performances counted singly during the official voting window and only accredited to the live show in concern. When a competitor's performance peaked within the Top 10 of the iTunes \"Top 200 Singles Chart\" during this window, it was given an iTunes bonus that multiplies iTunes votes made by ten. In season 5, the iTunes bonus multiplier was reduced to five for the studio versions of the songs performed by the competitors. The finale's vote count included a 'Cumulative iTunes Vote Total' of all singles (from the live shows onwards) purchased during and outside of the various voting windows, with iTunes bonuses previously earned.[13] Between seasons 15 and 17, the bonus multiplier was revised to include streams counting as a vote, and the only artist with the most streams after the voting window ended would receive the bonus.[14] The iTunes bonus multiplier was discontinued beginning with the live shows of season 18, as the performances are now recorded away from the studios and could not be recorded to iTunes or Spotify; this measure was initially enacted for safety reasons as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.[15] In season 19, studio performances are now recorded on YouTube Music, replacing the traditional iTunes and Spotify recordings that were done between the seasons 2\u201317, but this was changed back beginning season 20, though bonuses do not apply regardless if the song charted within the top 10 or not. Season 22 was the first season to not have any studio performances released on any platform overall.\nOnly the studio recording of the contestants' performances, not the live performance, were available on iTunes. In the first season, the battle rounds were recorded in the studio with both artists in the pairing. However, from season 2 to season 18, only the winner's version of the song from the battle round was released. Season 7 reverted to the old style of both artists. With the introduction of the Knockout Rounds in season three, where each contestant sang a separate song, only the winner's single was released.\nThe \"Instant Save\" was introduced in season five. During the live elimination episodes, viewers are given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants at risk of elimination by using their Twitter account (and since season 17, the official app) to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 13. Home viewers can only vote once per account for one contestant of their choice. Since season six, the instant saves now function as a last-chance performance where artists perform an additional song to rally votes.\nCeeLo Green of Gnarls Barkley and Adam Levine of Maroon 5 became the first confirmed coaches in February 2011,[16] followed by Christina Aguilera[17] and Blake Shelton in March.[18] Aguilera and Green did not return for season four and were replaced by Shakira and Usher.[19] Aguilera and Green then returned for season five, while Shakira and Usher returned for season six.[20][21] In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in February 2014, Green revealed that he would not be returning to The Voice.[22] On March 31, 2014, it was announced that Pharrell Williams would become Green's replacement.[23] On April 19, 2014, it was announced that No Doubt's Gwen Stefani would replace Aguilera in season seven due to her pregnancy.[citation needed] On May 20, 2014, Shakira and Usher confirmed that after season six, they would focus on their music.[24][25] On March 25, 2016, Miley Cyrus confirmed that following her role as key advisor during the tenth season that she would be joining the series once again in its eleventh season as a coach.[26] That same day, Alicia Keys was also announced to be joining the series as a coach for the eleventh season.[27] On October 18, 2016, it was announced that Stefani would re-join the coaches' panel for the series' twelfth season, alongside returning coaches Keys, Levine and Shelton; it was also confirmed that Cyrus would return for the thirteenth season.[28]\nOn April 27, 2017, in an interview published by TV Insider, Keys confirmed that the twelfth season would be her last.

Previously in 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that The Voice \"is most popular in North Dakota and least popular in New York. It was behind only Duck Dynasty and Fast N' Loud in its correlation with Trump voters\".[57]\nThe first season premiered strong at 11.78 million viewers and actually grew upon that audience through its first season. In the 18\u201349 demographic, the show constantly found itself in the top 5. For its average season rating, the show landed itself as no. 20 with total viewers at nearly 12 million viewers. In the 18\u201349 rankings, the show was no. 4 at a 5.4 ranking.\nThe second season premiered on Super Bowl Sunday, February 5, 2012, and for a while managed to keep a 6.0 in the adults 18\u201349 demographic and 17 million viewers. Partnering The Voice with Smash (NBC's musical drama) helped NBC win the Monday night ratings. However, by Monday, April 9, the ratings had fallen to a 4.0 rating in the adult 18\u201349 demographic.\nThe third season premiered on Monday, September 10, 2012, to 12.28 million viewers and a 4.2 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic and has since then grown to a season-high 4.8 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic on October 8, October 15 and 29, 2012 and a 4.9 rating in the finale. The Voice, along with NBC's new drama, Revolution has once again led NBC to win every Monday night of the season so far, just like it did last season. On Tuesdays, comedies Go On and The New Normal has been successful thanks to The Voice, leading NBC to be the only network of the Big 5 to grow in ratings from last season.\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\nThe Voice: I Want You is a video game based on the television show. It was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Wii U on October 21, 2014, and was published by Activision. The game includes a microphone and has songs from the show including songs performed by the coaches.\nThe Voice is broadcast on the NBC network in the United States. The show premiered in Canada on April 26, 2011, on CTV. In Asia, the series began airing on August 21, 2011, on AXN and was transferred to Star World (now Fox Life) starting in Season 11 until cessation of transmission on October 1, 2021.[117] It premiered in New Zealand on July 16, 2011, on TV2, in Australia on August 9, 2011, on Go!, in South Africa on October 5, 2011, on SABC 3, and on March 31, 2012, in the Philippines on Studio 23 (now S+A).[118] On May 22, 2019, it premiered in Germany on sixx starting Season 14.[119]",

        "question": "Who was the winner of American Idol this year?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol#:~:text=Thompson%2C%20and-,Iam%20Tongi,-.",
        "context": "\nAmerican Idol was based on the British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition Popstars. Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain.[6] Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, including telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows, such as the Eurovision Song Contest), the drama of backstories, and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time.[7]Pop Idol debuted in Britain in 2001 with Lythgoe as showrunner\u200d\u2014\u200cthe executive producer and production leader\u200d\u2014\u200cand Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was successful with the viewing public.[8]\nIn 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the United States, but the idea was initially met with poor responses from all the television networks including Fox.[9] However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was later persuaded to buy the series by his daughter, Elisabeth, who had seen the British show.[9] Although Fox's executives wanted to change the format, Murdoch insisted that it should remain the same as the British one. One change was nevertheless made due to the presence of multiple time zones in the United States that made it impractical for the country to vote in the same time period, an additional half-hour results show was therefore added the day following the performance show.[10] The show was renamed American Idol: The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job of showrunner, but turned down the offer; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to the surprise of Cowell and Fox, it became one of the biggest shows of the summer.[11][12] With its successful launch in the summer, the show was then moved to January and expanded.[13] The show grew into a phenomenon largely due to its personal engagement with the contestants by prompting the viewers to vote, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show on U.S. television, a position it then held for seven consecutive seasons until 2011.[14][15]\nHowever, after a few years of sharp declining ratings starting in 2012, with rating falls of over 20% each season,[16] the fifteenth season would be its last on Fox, ending its run in April 2016.[17] In May 2017, ABC acquired the rights to the series and the program returned for the 2017\u201318 television season.[18][19] The first season of the revived series, or the 16th season overall, started airing in March 2018.[20] Six seasons have been aired on ABC as of May 2023.[21]\nThe show had originally planned on having four judges following the Pop Idol format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell.[9] A fourth judge, radio DJ Stryker, was originally chosen but he dropped out citing \"image concerns.\"[22] In the second season, New York radio personality Angie Martinez had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew only after a few days of auditions due to not being comfortable with giving out criticism.[23] The show decided to continue with the three judges format until the eighth season. All three original judges stayed on the judging panel for eight seasons.\nIn the eighth season, Latin Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge. Abdul left the show in 2009 after the eighth season as a result of failing to agree to terms with the show producers.[24]Emmy Award-winning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul for the ninth season, but left in 2010 after just one season.[25] DioGuardi was let go from American Idol in 2010 after two seasons as producers favored a return to the three-person judge panel previously used prior to DioGuardi's appearance on the show.[26] Cowell also left the show in 2010 to introduce the American version of his show The X Factor for 2011.[27] Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth.\nJennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined the judging panel in the tenth season,[28] but both left in 2012 after two seasons.[29] Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. They were replaced by three new judges, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, and Keith Urban, who joined Jackson in the twelfth season.[30] However, both Carey and Minaj left after one season,[31] and Jackson departed the show after twelve seasons as a judge but would return as a mentor for the thirteenth season in 2014, after which he left the show permanently.[32][33]\nUrban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Lopez returned to American Idol for the thirteenth season and was joined by former mentor Harry Connick Jr.[1] After this, Lopez, Urban, and Connick Jr. remained on the show until its cancellation after the fifteenth season in 2016.[34][35]\nThe first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman following the format of Pop Idol of using two presenters. Dunkleman quit thereafter,[40] resulting in Seacrest becoming the sole host starting with the second season in 2003.\nSeacrest has remained as sole host of American Idol ever since, with the exception of the two-year hiatus between 2016 and 2018 as well as April 8, 2019, when Bobby Bones subbed for Seacrest after the latter fell ill.[41] Dunkleman did, however, return for the initial series finale on Fox in 2016 as a guest.[42]\nThe eligible age-range for contestants is fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in the fourth season, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in the tenth season. The contestants have to be legal U.S. residents, can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons, and must not have held a current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage[43] (in previous years by the audition stage).[44]\nFor the first eighteen seasons, contestants went through at least three sets of cuts. The first was a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these made it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sing in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television.[45] Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10 and 60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood (the average total is between 150 and 200)[citation needed].\nFrom the nineteenth season onwards, contestants request a Zoom interview and audition remotely for the show's producers. If the audition goes well, they will then invite the contestants to audition in front of the judges, in one of the audition cities.[46]\nOnce in Hollywood, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until the tenth season, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood.[47] In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and performed a song together.[48] In the final round, the contestants performed solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band\u200d\u2014\u200cdepending on the season. In the second and third seasons, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In the seventh season, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round.[49] In the twelfth season, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.\nIn the tenth and eleventh seasons, a further round was added in Las Vegas, where the contestants performed in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists.[50][51] At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants were selected to move on to the semi-final stage. In the twelfth season the Las Vegas round became a Sudden Death round, where the judges had to choose five guys and five girls each night (four nights) to make the top twenty.[52] In the thirteenth season, the Las Vegas round was eliminated and a new round called \"Hollywood or Home\" was added, where if the judges were uncertain about some contestants, those contestants were required to perform soon after landing in Los Angeles, and those who failed to impress were sent back home before they reached Hollywood.[53] In the fourteenth season, the \"Hollywood or Home\" round was dropped, and a Showcase round was added, where the contestants performed at the House of Blues or auditorium for the judges and a live audience, and these performances determine who makes into the Top 24.[54] In the seventeenth and eighteenth seasons, the showcase round took place in Hawaii. In the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first seasons, a showstopper round was used.\nFrom the semi-finals onward, the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a toll-free telephone number for each contestant was displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message was registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers were allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window. However, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers.[55] One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges. Over 110 million votes were cast in the first season, and by the tenth season the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million. Voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when AT&T Wireless joined as a sponsor of the show, and 7.5 million text messages were sent to American Idol that season.[56] The number of text messages rapidly increased, reaching 178 million texts by the eighth season.[57] Online voting was offered for the first time in the tenth season. The votes are counted and verified by Telescope Inc.[58]\nIn the first three seasons, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In the first season, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In the second and third seasons, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. These seasons also featured a wildcard round, where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In the first season, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In the second and third seasons, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all.\nFrom the fourth through seventh and ninth seasons, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.\nThe wildcard round returned in the eighth season, wherein there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward \u2013 the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer \u2013 for each night, and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. Starting in tenth season, the girls and boys perform on separate nights. In the tenth and eleventh seasons, five of each gender were chosen, and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13. In the twelfth season, the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups, with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10. In the thirteenth season, there were thirty semifinalists, but only twenty semifinalists (ten for each gender) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows, with five in each gender based on the vote and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13. In the fourteenth season, the top 24 performed at The Fillmore Detroit, starting with the 12 males on one night and then the 12 females on the next night. The following week, the same order went for the top 16, with four males eliminated, followed by four females based on the vote. Then, on the first night of finals, a similar sequence from the thirteenth season was used to determine the final 12, with five of each gender based on the vote and two wildcards chosen by the judges. In the fifteenth season, the top 24 performed at Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in Los Angeles and were split into two groups of twelve and performed twice, one being a solo performance and one being a duet with a former Idol contestant. In each group, the judges chose 7 contestants to advance to the top 14 where the judges chose 4 to advance to the top 10 and remaining 6 contestants were chosen based on the vote. In the sixteenth season, the top 24 performed at the Academy in the Heart of LA, and the show repeated the process from the previous season. However, instead of Idol alumnus as duet partners, superstar celebrity singers were used as the duet partners. In the seventeenth season, the same process was repeated again. However, instead of a top 24, it's a top 20, the contestants performed at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, and performed solos in one episode, and performed the duets in two episodes. In the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the top 20 performed at their homes, and based on the vote, half of the top 20 would advance to the top 10, and the other half would be eliminated. However, a wild card was given to one of the bottom 10 to save them from elimination.[59][60] In the nineteenth season, the show used a combination of the process from the sixteenth and fourteenth seasons. In the twentieth season, the show repeated the process from the previous season, but they used a top 20 instead of a top 16, and there were no all star duets. In the twenty-first season, the same process was repeated, but they started with a top 26 instead of a top 24.\nThe finals are broadcast in primetime from Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience (except the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). From 2002 to 2022, the venue was CBS Television City. Starting in 2023, it changed to Red Studios. The finals lasted eight weeks in the first season. From the second to ninth and fourteenth seasons, the finals lasted eleven weeks. The tenth and eleventh seasons lasted for twelve weeks, while the twelfth season lasted for ten weeks. In the thirteenth season, the finals lasted thirteen weeks. The finals lasted seven weeks in the fifteenth season, and six weeks in the sixteenth season. Each finalist performs songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as Motown, disco, or big band, songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley or The Beatles, or more general themes such as Billboard number-one hits or songs from the contestant's year of birth. Contestants usually worked with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. From the tenth to twelfth seasons, Jimmy Iovine was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sang one song each week, but this was increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.\nThe most popular contestants are usually not revealed in the results show. Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes was called to the center of the stage. One of these three was usually sent to safety; however the two remaining were not necessarily the bottom two.[61] The contestant with the fewest votes was then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant's time on the show was played and they gave their final performance (from the fourteenth season onward, the montage and the final performance were dropped). However, in the sixth season, during the series' first ever Idol Gives Back episode, no contestant was eliminated, but on the following week, two were sent home. Moreover, from the eighth season onwards, the judges may overturn viewers' decision with a \"Judges' Save\" if they unanimously agreed to. \"The save\" could only be used once, and only up through the Top 5. In the eighth to tenth and fourteenth seasons, a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save, but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons, a regular single elimination took place. The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently, a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week.\nThe \"Fan Save\" was introduced in the fourteenth season. During the finals, viewers were given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 8.\nDuring the original run of American Idol on Fox, the finale week consisted of a one-hour long final performance night and a two-hour last episode of the season that culminates in revealing the winner, both of which are broadcast live in the U.S. Eastern and Central time zones. For the first, third through sixth and fourteenth through fifteenth seasons it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The second-season finale took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre, which had an audience capacity of over 6,000. In the seventh through thirteenth seasons, the venue was at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live, which holds an audience of over 7,000. Since the show's reboot on ABC, the venue remains the same throughout the entire show (excluding auditions), but has been stretched to a single three-hour season finale that is annually aired live simultaneously in all U.S. territories. The eighteenth-season finale was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe winner usually receives a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums,[62][63] and secures a management contract with American Idol-affiliated 19 Management (which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts. All winners prior to the ninth season reportedly earned at least $1 million in their first year as winner.[63] At first the contract came with a $250,000-plus advance, but dropped to about $62,500 over the Fox years.[64] All the runners-up of the first ten seasons, as well as some of other finalists, had also received record deals with major labels. However, starting in the eleventh season, the runner-up may only be guaranteed a single-only deal.[65]BMG/Sony (first through ninth seasons), UMG (tenth through fifteenth seasons), and Disney Music Group's Hollywood Records (sixteenth through eighteenth seasons) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season's finale. In the fourteenth and fifteenth seasons, the winner was signed with Big Machine Records. Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants' albums, such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. All top 10 (11 in the tenth and twelfth seasons, 5 in the fourteenth season, and 7 in the sixteenth season) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour, where the participants may each earn a six-figure sum.[66]\n^Owing to the production difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the finale had five contestants instead of three, and the three contestants who failed to place in the top 2 finished in joint-third place.\nEach season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round from the tenth through twelfth seasons), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinals onward the contestants perform their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed during a results segment. The results segment feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results also features homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner of the season is revealed.\nWith the exception of the first two seasons, the contestants in the semifinals onward perform in front of a studio audience. They perform with a full band in the finals. The current musical director is Kris Pooley, who has been with the show since the sixteenth season. In previous seasons, the American Idol band was led by Rickey Minor (fourth through ninth and thirteenth through fifteenth seasons) and Ray Chew (tenth through twelfth seasons). Assistance has also been given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and Debra Byrd to contestants behind the scene. Starting with the seventh season, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onward. In later seasons, the contestants were allowed to perform with a musical instrument in the auditions. During the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays from the tenth through thirteenth seasons, with the tenth, eleventh and thirteenth season finales aired on Tuesday and Wednesday. From the fourteenth season onward, there were no separate results shows. On the fourteenth season, the show aired on Wednesday nights, and on the fifteenth season, Thursday nights. From the sixteenth season onward, it aired on Sundays and Mondays.[citation needed]\nThe first season of American Idol debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell served as judges.\nIn the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital.[67]Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed on his blog, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.[68]\nIn what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, \"A Moment Like This\", went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, From Justin to Kelly, which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become one of the most successful Idol contestants internationally,[70] with worldwide album sales of more than 25 million.[71]\nFollowing the success of the first season, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show's budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Ryan Seacrest as the lone host. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Kristin Adams was a correspondent for this season.[72]\nCorey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation.[73] Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year \u2013 Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and Frenchie Davis for having previously modeled for an adult website.[74]\nThe season finale drew more than 38 million viewers, marking Idol's biggest audience ever for a single episode. Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner, beating Clay Aiken by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through.[75] In an interview prior to the fifth season, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.[76]\nBoth finalists found success after the show, but Aiken out-performed Studdard's coronation song \"Flying Without Wings\" with his single release from the show \"This Is the Night\", as well as in their subsequent album releases. The fourth-place finisher Josh Gracin also enjoyed some success as a country singer.[77]\nThe third season premiered on January 19, 2004. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\" received widespread attention. His exposure on Idol landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third bestselling singer from that season.[78]\nMuch media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated.[79] Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes \"incredibly racist\".[80] The prolonged stays of John Stevens and Jasmine Trias in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke 'blown out of proportion'.[81]\nThe performance of \"Summertime\" by Barrino, later known simply as \"Fantasia\", at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite Idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show.[82] Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single \"I Believe\", a song co-written by the first season finalist Tamyra Gray, and DeGarmo released \"Dreams\".\nThe fourth season premiered on January 18, 2005. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This was the first full season of the series to be aired in high definition; the finale of the third season was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season,[44] and among those who benefited from this new rule were Constantine Maroulis and Bo Bice, the two rockers of the show.\nThe top 12 finalists originally included Mario Vazquez, but he dropped out citing 'personal reasons'[83] and was replaced by Nikko Smith. Later, an employee of Fremantle Media, which produces the show, sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by Vazquez toward him during the show.[84]\nDuring the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.\nIn May 2005, Carrie Underwood was announced the winner, with Bice the runner-up. Both Underwood and Bice released the coronation song \"Inside Your Heaven\", with Underwood's version of the song making her the first country artist ever to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[85] As of 2015, Underwood has become the most successful Idol contestant in the U.S.,[70] selling 16 million albums in the country,[86] while selling a total of 65 million records worldwide.[87]\nThe fifth season began on January 17, 2006. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. It remains the highest-rated season in the show's run so far. Two of the more prominent contestants during the Hollywood round were the Brittenum twins who were later disqualified for identity theft.[88]\nChris Daughtry's performance of Fuel's \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\" on the show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new lead singer, an invitation he declined.[89] His performance of Live's version of \"I Walk the Line\" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters for not crediting the arrangement to Live.[90] He was eliminated at the top four in a shocking result.\nThe sixth season began on Tuesday, January 16, 2007. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The premiere drew a massive audience of 37.3 million viewers, peaking in the last half hour with more than 41 million viewers.[92]\nTeenager Sanjaya Malakar was the season's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo,[93] and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog Vote for the Worst and satellite radio personality Howard Stern, who both encouraged fans to vote for him. However, on the Top 7 results, Sanjaya was voted off.[94]\nThis season saw the first Idol Gives Back telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76 million in corporate and viewer donations.[95] No contestant was eliminated that week, but two (Phil Stacey and Chris Richardson) were eliminated the next.\nThis season also saw the launch of the American Idol Songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the \"coronation song\". Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, \"This Is My Now\", was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by Sparks on May 24, 2007.[96]\nThe seventh season premiered on January 15, 2008, for a two-day, four-hour premiere. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The media focused on the professional status of the seventh season contestants, the so-called 'ringers',[97] many of whom, including Kristy Lee Cook, Brooke White, Michael Johns, and in particular Carly Smithson, had prior recording contracts.[98] Contestant David Hernandez also attracted some attention due to his past employment as a stripper.[99]\nFor the finals, American Idol debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. David Cook's performance of \"Billie Jean\" on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the Chris Cornell arrangement to be David Cook's own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell's version. Cornell himself said he was 'flattered' and praised David Cook's performance.[100] David Cook was taken to the hospital after the top-nine performance show due to heart palpitations and high blood pressure.[101]\nDavid Archuleta's performance of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in the tenth season, called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget.[102]Jason Castro's semi-final performance of \"Hallelujah\" also received considerable attention, and it propelled Jeff Buckley's version of the song to the top of the Billboarddigital song chart.[103] This was the first season in which contestants' recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts.[104]\nIdol Gives Back returned on April 9, 2008, and raised $64 million for charity.[95]\nThe finalists were Cook and Archuleta. David Cook was announced the winner on May 21, 2008, the first rocker to win the show. Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S.[91]\nThe American Idol Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the \"coronation song\". The winning song, \"The Time of My Life\", was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008.\nThe eighth season premiered on January 13, 2009. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This season featured the first major change to the judging panel; a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced. Mike Darnell, the president of alternative programming for Fox, stated that the season would focus more on the contestants' personal life.[105]\nThis was also the first season without executive producer Nigel Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show So You Think You Can Dance.[106] The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. Idol Gives Back was canceled for this season due to the global recession at the time.\nThere were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the \"Judges' Save\", and Matt Giraud was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated.\nThe two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since the second season. It was claimed,[107] and then later retracted,[108] that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from Allen's home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.[109]\nBoth Allen and Lambert released the coronation song, \"No Boundaries\" which was co-written by DioGuardi. This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status.[110]\nThe ninth season premiered on January 12, 2010. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Kara DioGuardi, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Paula Abdul left the show and Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week. One of the most prominent auditioners this season was General Larry Platt whose performance of \"Pants on the Ground\" became a viral hit song.[111]\nCrystal Bowersox, who has Type-I diabetes, fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized.[112] The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer, wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.[112]\nMichael Lynche was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges' Save. The next week Katie Stevens and Andrew Garcia were eliminated. That week, Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first Idol alum to do so. Idol Gives Back returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised $45 million.[95]\nA special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show's past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.\nThe final two contestants were Lee DeWyze and Bowersox. DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song \u2013 DeWyze chose U2's \"Beautiful Day\", and Bowersox chose Patty Griffin's \"Up to the Mountain\". This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.[113]\nThe tenth season premiered on January 19, 2011. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the American version of The X Factor), Kara DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres, who left the show on her own accord.[114][28]\nRandy Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth. Nigel Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the new partner of American Idol, acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors,[28] although in later episodes special guest mentors such as Beyonc\u00e9, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in.\nThe tenth season is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40-second video audition via Myspace.[115]Karen Rodriguez was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds.\nOne of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina, whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fianc\u00e9e received widespread coverage.[116] Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. Casey Abrams, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. In the following week, Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated.\nPia Toscano, one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticisms from some former Idol contestants, as well as actor Tom Hanks.[117] After Idol, Jennifer Lopez helped guide her career.[118]\nThe two finalists in 2011 were Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery, both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win American Idol. McCreery released his first single, \"I Love You This Big\", as his coronation song, and Alaina released \"Like My Mother Does\". McCreery's debut album, Clear as Day, became the first debut album by an Idol winner to reach No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 since Ruben Studdard's Soulful in 2003, and he became the youngest male artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200.[119]\nThe eleventh season premiered on January 18, 2012. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, and Randy Jackson returned as judges. One more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25, which was later revealed to be Jermaine Jones. However, on March 14, Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants. Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests.[120]\nFinalist Phillip Phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to the hospital before the Top 13 results show, and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones.[121] He was reported to have eight surgeries during his Idol run, and had considered quitting the show due to the pain.[122] He underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished.[123]\nJessica Sanchez received the fewest votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their \"save\" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, Colton Dixon was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.\nPhillips became the winner, beating Sanchez. During the finale, fifth season finalist Ace Young proposed marriage to third season runner-up Diana DeGarmo on stage \u2013 which she accepted.[124]\nPhillips released \"Home\" as his coronation song, while Sanchez released \"Change Nothing\". Phillips' \"Home\" has since become the best selling of all coronation songs, with over 5 million copies sold.[125][126]\nThe twelfth season premiered on January 16, 2013. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. Randy Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. This season's judging panel consisted of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj.\nThis was the first season since the ninth season to have four judges on the panel. The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to TMZ.[127]\nThe top 10 contestants started with five males and five females, however, the males were eliminated consecutively in the first five weeks, with Lazaro Arbos the last male to be eliminated. For the first time in the show's history, the top 5 contestants were all female. It was also the first time that the judges' \"save\" was not used, the top four contestants were therefore given an extra week to perform again with their votes carried over with no elimination in the first week.\n23-year-old Candice Glover won the season with Kree Harrison taking the runner-up spot. Glover is the first female to win American Idol since Jordin Sparks. Glover released \"I Am Beautiful\" as a single while Harrison released \"All Cried Out\" immediately after the show. Glover sold poorly with her debut album, and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label.[128]\nTowards the end of the season, Randy Jackson, the last remaining of the original judges, announced he would no longer serve as a judge to pursue other business ventures.[32] Both judges Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj also decided to leave after one season to focus on their music careers.[31]\nThe thirteenth season premiered on January 15, 2014. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Keith Urban returned as a judge. Urban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Randy Jackson returned, though Jackson moved from the judging panel to the role of in-mentor. Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj left the panel after one season. Former judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick, Jr. joined Urban on the panel. Connick Jr. served as a mentor for Idol in 2010 and 2012.[129] Also, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick were replaced as executive producers by Per Blankens, Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Pragger. Bill DeRonde replaced Warwick as a director of the audition episodes, while Louis J. Horvitz replaced Gregg Gelfand as a director of the show.[130]\nThis was the first season where the contestants were permitted to perform in the final rounds songs they wrote themselves. In the Top 8, Sam Woolf received the fewest votes, but he was saved from elimination by the judges. The 500th episode of the series was the Top 3 performance night.[131]\nThe fourteenth season premiered on January 7, 2015. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick, Jr. returned for their respective fourth, third and second seasons as judges. Eighth season runner-up Adam Lambert filled in for Urban during the New York City auditions. Randy Jackson did not return as the in-house mentor and left the show permanently.[134]Scott Borchetta replaced Jackson as the mentor.\nChanges this season include only airing one episode a week during the final ten.[135] Coca-Cola ended their longtime sponsorship of the show[136] and Ford Motor Company maintained a reduced role. The winner of the season also received a recording contract with Big Machine Records.\nNick Fradiani won the season, defeating Clark Beckham. Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region. Fradiani released \"Beautiful Life\" as his coronation single while Beckham released \"Champion\". Jax, the third place finalist, also released a single called \"Forcefield\".\nFox announced on May 11, 2015, that the fifteenth season would be the final season of American Idol; as such, the season was expected to have an additional focus on the program's alumni. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, with Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez all returning as judges.[17] The fifteenth season premiered on January 6, 2016. The season was shortened by four weeks compared to previous years.[137] During the finale episode, President Barack Obama praised the millions of young people that voted for contestants and pitched that they vote in the upcoming election. The farewell season concluded on April 7, 2016. Seacrest signed off by saying: \"And one more time\u2014this is so tough\u2014we say to you from Hollywood, goodnight America\", and then he added, \"for now.\"[138]\nIn early 2017, Variety reported that Fremantle Media was in talks to revive the show for NBC or for its original network, Fox.[142] A dispute between Fremantle and Core Media Group derailed these plans.[143] In May 2017, ABC was making a bid to revive the program.[144] ABC acquired the rights to the series, and American Idol returned for the 2017\u201318 television season.[145][146]\nIn July 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would return as host,[147] and by September 2017 it was revealed that Katy Perry,[36]Luke Bryan[37] and Lionel Richie would serve as judges.[38][148] The sixteenth season premiered on March 11, 2018.[20] This was the first season of American Idol to air on ABC. The season was again shortened compared to the previous season to twelve weeks, with multiple elimination in the final rounds. Unlike previous seasons where only two finalists remained in the final episode, three finalists performed in the finale. On May 21, 2018, the season concluded with Maddie Poppe crowned the winner, beating Caleb Lee Hutchinson as runner-up and Gabby Barrett in third place. Her winning song was \"Going, Going, Gone\". Caleb Lee Hutchinson released \"Johnny Cash Heart\" as a single, while Gabby Barrett's song was \"Rivers Deep\".[149]\nABC renewed the revival series for another season. Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[150] The seventeenth season premiered on March 3, 2019. For the finale, the show no longer features separate performance and result shows. On May 19, 2019, the season concluded with three finalists, with Madison VanDenburg eliminated in third place after performing two songs, and the final two performing their last song. For the first time, there were no separate performance and grand finale shows this season. Laine Hardy was crowned the winner and Alejandro Aranda runner-up. Hardy released a single, \"Flame\", immediately after the win, but Aranda did not.[151][152] However, Aranda later released a song he performed in the finale, \"Tonight\", under the name Scarypoolparty on June 28, 2019.[153]\nOn May 13, 2019, the series was renewed for an eighteenth season and it premiered on February 16, 2020.[154][155] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[156] For the first time, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, from the top 20 to the finale, the contestants performed in their own homes, while Ryan Seacrest hosted the show remotely in his own home in Los Angeles with the judges also in their respective homes.[60][157] The season was also further truncated, with the top 5 performing in the finale. Each finalist also performed only two songs for the finale.[158] On May 17, the season concluded, with Just Sam crowned as the winner, with Arthur Gunn finishing as the runner-up.[159] \"Rise Up\", the song Just Sam performed for their audition and reprised on the finale, was released as their debut song.[160][161]\nOn May 15, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a nineteenth season and it premiered on February 14, 2021.[162][163] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[164] Later in October, it was announced that Bobby Bones will return as mentor.

On May 21, the season concluded, with Iam Tongi crowned as the winner, with Megan Danielle finishing as the runner-up.\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of American Idol. It holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in the Nielsen annual television ratings; it became the highest-rated of all television programs in the United States overall for an unprecedented seven consecutive years,[173] or eight consecutive (and total) years when either its performance or result show was ranked number one overall.[5]\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\nAmerican Idol premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002. The first show drew 9.9 million viewers, giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30 pm spot in over a year.[239] The audience steadily grew, and by finale night, the audience had averaged 23 million, with more than 40 million watching some part of that show.[240] That episode was placed third amongst all age groups, but more importantly it led in the 18\u201349 demographic, the age group most valued by advertisers.[12]\nThe growth continued into the next season, starting with a season premiere of 26.5 million.[174] The season attracted an average of 21.7 million viewers, and was placed second overall amongst the 18\u201349 age group.[241] The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest-rated ever American Idol episode at 38.1 million for the final hour.[242] By the third season, the show had become the top show in the 18\u201349 demographic[242] a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including the tenth season, and its competition stages ranked first in the nationwide overall ratings. By the fourth season, American Idol had become the most-watched series amongst all viewers on American TV for the first time, with an average viewership of 26.8 million.[243] The show reached its peak in the fifth season with numbers averaging 30.6 million per episode, and this season remains the highest-rated of the series.[243]\nThe sixth season premiered with the series' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most-watched episodes of American Idol. During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before,[3] as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC's The Cosby Show. The show was dubbed \"the Death Star\",[92] and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses.[3] However, the sixth season also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year. The sixth season was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second-highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.[242]\nThe loss of viewers continued into the seventh season. The premiere was down 11% among total viewers,[174] and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest-rated Wednesday show among the 18\u201334 demo since the first season in 2002.[244] However, the ratings rebounded for the seventh-season finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids, and improved over the sixth season as the series' third most watched finale. The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most watched TV network in the country for the first time since its inception, a first ever in American television history for a non-Big Three major broadcast network.[245] Overall ratings for the season were down 10% from the sixth season,[246] which is in line with the fall in viewership across all networks due in part to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike.[247]\nThe declining trend however continued into the eighth season, as total viewers numbers fell by 5\u201310% for early episodes compared to the seventh season,[248] and by 9% for the finale.[175] In the ninth season, Idol's six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken, when NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 17 beat Idol in the same time slot with 30.1 million viewers over Idol's 18.4 million.[249] Nevertheless, American Idol overall finished its ninth season as the most watched TV series for the sixth year running, breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by CBS' All in the Family and NBC's The Cosby Show.[250]\nIn the tenth season, the total viewer numbers for the first week of shows fell 12\u201313%, and by up to 23% in the 18\u201349 demo compared to the ninth season.[196] Later episodes, however, retained viewers better, and the season ended on a high with a significant increase in viewership for the finale \u2013 up 12% for the adults 18\u201349 demographic and a 21% increase in total viewers from the ninth-season finale.[251] While the overall viewer number has increased this season, its viewer demographics have continued to age year on year \u2013 the median age this season was 47.2 compared to a median age of 32.1 in its first season.[252] The demographics also became \"whiter\" over time and less diverse.[253] Nevertheless, in the 2010\u201311 television season, Fox maintained its lead on over other networks with its seventh consecutive season of victory overall in the 18\u201349 demographic ratings in the United States.\nThe eleventh season, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as The Voice and The X Factor.[254] The ratings for the first two episodes of the eleventh season fell 16\u201321% in overall viewer numbers and 24\u201327% in the 18/49 demo,[200] while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18\u201349 demo.[201] The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. For the first time in eight years, American Idol lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to NBC Sunday Night Football, although the strengths of Idol in its second year in the Wednesday-Thursday primetime slots helped Fox achieve the longest period of 18\u201349 demographic victory in the Nielsen ratings, standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012.[202]\nThe loss of viewers continued into the twelfth season, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18\u201349 demo.[255] The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18\u201349 demo.[256] The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season.[257] The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18\u201349 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and American Idol lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013\u201314 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, and never regained its Top 10 position by the series' end in 2016.[34]\nThe continuing decline influenced further changes for the fourteenth season, including the loss of Coca-Cola as the show's major sponsor, and a decision to only broadcast one, two-hour show per week during the top 12 rounds (with results from the previous week integrated into the performance show, rather than having a separate results show).[258][35][259] On May 11, 2015, prior to the fourteenth-season finale, Fox announced that the fifteenth season of American Idol would be its last.[17] Despite these changes, the show's ratings would decline more sharply. The fourteenth-season finale was the lowest-rated finale ever, with an average of only 8.03 million viewers watching the finale. The show's ratings, however, rebounded in its final season and ended its run in 2016 as Fox's first-ever program to conclude its run without dropping from the Nielsen Top 30 most-watched television shows in each of its seasons.\nFor the revived series on ABC, the ratings were lower but remained stable compared to previous seasons on Fox. The finale of the seventeenth season was slightly more watched than the sixteenth.[260]\nEarly reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\".[261] Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\".[12] It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\",[262] and \"a romp in humiliation\".[263] Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted,[264] and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\".[265] The decision to send the first season winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"[266]\nSome of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of Entertainment Weekly, thought that \"for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, Idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business.\"[267] Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show \"undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism\".[268] Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has \"reshaped the American songbook\", \"led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture\", and connects \"the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future.\"[269] Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that \"Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him.\"[270] Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self-respect.[271]\nSome in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show. Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the \"true art form of music\", thought that shows like American Idol made it seem \"so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight\", and that \"television is a lie\".[272] Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol \"isn't really about music. It's about all the bad aspects of the music business \u2013 the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.' \"[273] That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that \"Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award\".[274] It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol, commenting on talent shows in general, said that \"there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs\".[275]American Idol revolutionized American pop culture and the pop idol process and has provided an opportunity for many to bypass the small club scene and allow a much larger audience to participate in and select the next potential chart topping performer.[276]\nThe success of the show's alumni, however, has led to a more positive assessment of the show, and the show was described as having \"proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records\".[277] While the industry is divided on the show success, its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format.[278] According to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, \"if you want to try and get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV, Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone\", and that country music and Idol \"go together well\".[279]\nThroughout the series, twelve of the seventeen Idol winners, including its first five, had come from the Southern United States.[284] A large number of other finalists during the series' run have also hailed from the American South, including Clay Aiken, Kellie Pickler, and Chris Daughtry,[284] who are all from North Carolina. In 2012, an analysis of the 131 contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that 48% have some connection to the Southern United States.[285]\nThe show itself was popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch American Idol during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as Kentucky, were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series.[284] Data from Nielsen SoundScan, a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47 million CDs sold by Idol contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.[284]\nTheories given for the success of Southerners on Idol have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the Bible Belt, where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing.[284][286][287] Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride.[288] According to fifth season winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of Alabama, \"People in the South have a lot of pride ... So, they're adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region.\"[284]\nFor five consecutive seasons, starting in the seventh season, the title was given to a white male who plays the guitar \u2013 a trend that Idol pundits call the \"White guy with guitar\" or \"WGWG\" factor.[289] Just hours before the eleventh-season finale, where Phillip Phillips was named the winner, Richard Rushfield, author of the book American Idol: The Untold Story, said, \"You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it, not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star competing on the contemporary radio, but as .... who's the nicest guy in a popularity contest\", he says, \"And that has led to this dynasty of four, and possibly now five, consecutive, affable, very nice, good-looking white boys.\"[289]\nSome fans call the final performance of the night the \"pimp spot\" because it usually receives a big boost in votes, due to the recency effect. By performing first, a performer may benefit from the primacy effect, but any other early performance may be stifled. The second performance spot is sometimes called the \"un-pimp spot\" because it is the least beneficial.[290]\nThe show was criticized in earlier seasons over the onerous contract contestants had to sign that gave excessive control to 19 Entertainment over their future careers[291] and handed a large part of their future earnings to the management.[292][293]\nIndividual contestants have generated controversy in this competition for their past actions[74][294] or for being 'ringers' planted by the producers.[97] A number of contestants have been disqualified for various reasons, such as for having an existing contract or undisclosed criminal record, although the show has also been accused of a double standard for disqualifying some but not others.[295]\nVoting results have been a consistent source of controversy. The mechanism of voting has aroused considerable criticism, most notably in the second season when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote,[75] and in the eighth season, when the massive increase in text votes[57] fueled the texting controversy.[109] Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the first season.[296] Since 2004, votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol and Vote for the Worst.[citation needed]\nThe enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated were transformative for the Fox Broadcasting Company. American Idol and other shows such as Survivor and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire were credited for expanding reality television programming in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, and Idol became the most watched non-scripted primetime television series, which it remained for almost a decade, from 2003 to 2012, breaking records on U.S. television (dominated by drama shows and sitcoms in the preceding decades).[297]\nThe show pushed Fox to become the number one U.S. TV network among adults aged 18\u201349,[298] the key demographic coveted by advertisers, for an unprecedented eight consecutive years by 2012.[299] Its success also helped lift the ratings of other shows that were scheduled around it such as House and Bones, and Idol, for years, was Fox's strongest platform primetime television program for promoting eventual hit shows of the 2010s (of the same network) such as Glee, New Girl and Empire.[3] The show, its creator Simon Fuller claimed, \"saved Fox\".[300]\nAs one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, American Idol has had a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment.[305][306] It helped create a number of highly successful recording artists, such as Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Carrie Underwood, as well as others of varying notability. The alumni of the show have received between them 54 Grammy nominations and 13 Grammy awards by 2016, with Carrie Underwood winning seven.[307][308]\nVarious American Idol alumni had success on various record charts around the world; in the U.S. they had achieved 345 number ones on the Billboardcharts in its first 10 years,[4] and 458 by its last year of broadcast in 2016, with 100 achieved by Kelly Clarkson alone.[309] According to Fred Bronson, author of books on the Billboard charts, no other entity has ever created as many hit-making artists and bestselling albums and singles.[310] In 2007, American Idol alums accounted for 2.1% of all music sales.[311] Its alumni have a massive impact on radio; in 2007, American Idol had become \"a dominant force in radio\" according to Rich Meyer, president of the radio station monitoring research company Mediabase.[312] By 2010, four winners each had more than a million radio spins, with Kelly Clarkson leading the field with over four million spins.[313]\nAt the end of the show's run on Fox in 2016, Idol's contestants have sold more than 60 million albums in the US, resulting in more than 80 Platinum records and 95 Gold records. Its participants have generated more than 450 Billboard No. 1 hits and sold more than 260 million digital downloads.[314]\nThe impact of American Idol was also strongly felt in musical theater, where many of Idol alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former American Idol contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on.[315][316] The casting of a popular Idol contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd,[317] won a role in Dreamgirls and eventually went on to win an Academy Award for her performance. She later became the show's first and only alumnus ever to win the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony).\nThe dominance of American Idol in the ratings had made it the most profitable show in U.S. TV for many years. The show was estimated to generate $900 million for the year 2004 through sales of TV ads, albums, merchandise and concert tickets.[300] By the seventh season, the show was estimated to earn around $900 million from its ad revenue alone, not including ancillary sponsorship deals and other income.[320][321] One estimate puts the total TV revenue for the first eight seasons of American at $6.4 billion.[322] Sponsors that bought fully integrated packages can expect a variety of promotions of their products on the show, such as product placement, adverts and product promotion integrated into the show, and various promotional opportunities.[323] Other off-air promotional partners pay for the rights to feature \"Idol\" branding on their packaging, products and marketing programs.[324]American Idol also partnered with Disney in its theme park attraction The American Idol Experience.\nAmerican Idol became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting the fourth season,[325] and by the next season, it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series, selling over $700,000 for a 30-seconds slot,[326] and reaching up to $1.3 million for the finale.[327] Its ad prices reached a peak in the seventh season at $737,000.[321] Estimated revenue more than doubled from $404 million in the third season to $870 million in the sixth season.[328] While that declined from the eighth season onwards, it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor,[329][330] with advertising revenue topping $800 million annually the next few seasons.[331] However, the sharp drop in ratings in the eleventh season also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for the twelfth season, and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers.[332] By 2014, ad revenue from had fallen to $427 million where a 30-second spot went for less than $300,000.[333] For the relaunched Idol on ABC, it has been reported that a 30-second spot may cost between $120,000\u2013$160,000.[334]\nFord Motor Company and Coca-Cola were two of the first sponsors of American Idol in its first season. The sponsorship deal cost around $10 million in the first season,[335] rising to $35 million by the seventh season,[324] and between $50 to $60 million in the tenth season.[336] The third major sponsor AT&T Wireless joined in the second season but ended after the twelfth season, and Coca-Cola officially ended its sponsorship after the thirteenth season amidst the declining ratings of Idol in the mid-2010s. iTunes sponsored the show since the seventh season.\nAmerican Idol prominent display of its sponsors' logo and products had been noted since the early seasons.[12][240] By the sixth season, Idol showed 4,349 product placements according to Nielsen Media Research.[337] The branded entertainment integration proved beneficial to its advertisers \u2013 promotion of AT&T text-messaging as a means to vote successfully introduced the technology into the wider culture,[56][338] and Coca-Cola has seen its equity increased during the show.[339]\nCoca-Cola \u2013 Cups bearing logo of Coca-Cola, and occasionally its subsidiary Vitaminwater,[340] are featured prominently on the judges table. Contestants are shown between songs held in the \"Coca-Cola Red Room\", the show's equivalent of the green room. (The Coca-Cola logo however is obscured during rebroadcast in the UK which until 2011 banned product placement.[341])\nFord \u2013 Contestants appear in the special Ford videos on the results shows, and winners Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Hicks, and Kris Allen have also appeared in commercials for Ford.[323] The final two each won a free Ford Mustang in the fourth through sixth seasons, Ford Escape Hybrid in the seventh season, Ford Fusion Hybrid in the eighth season, Ford Fiesta in the ninth season, and 2013 Ford Fusion in the eleventh season. In the tenth season Scotty McCreery chose a Ford F-150 and Lauren Alaina chose Shelby Mustang. In the red room, there is a glass table with a Ford wheel as its base.\nAT&T \u2013 AT&T Mobility is promoted as the service provider for text-voting. AT&T created an ad campaign that centered on an air-headed teenager going around telling people to vote.\nPrevious sponsors include Old Navy and Clairol's Herbal Essences. In the second and third seasons, contestants sometimes donned Old Navy clothing for their performances with celebrity stylist Steven Cojocaru assisting with their wardrobe selection,[342] and contestants received Clairol-guided hair makeovers. In the seventh-season finale, both David Cook and David Archuleta appeared in \"Risky Business\"-inspired commercials for Guitar Hero, a sponsor of the tour that year.\nCoca-Cola's archrival PepsiCo declined to sponsor American Idol at the show's start. What the Los Angeles Times later called \"missing one of the biggest marketing opportunities in a generation\" contributed to Pepsi losing market share, by 2010 falling to third place from second in the United States. PepsiCo sponsored the American version of Cowell's The X Factor in hopes of not repeating its Idol mistake until its cancellation.[343]\nThe top ten (eleven in the tenth season, five in the fourteenth season, and seven in the sixteenth season) toured at the end of every season except for the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons.[345][346] In the twelfth season tour a semi-finalist who won a sing-off was also added to the tour. Kellogg's Pop-Tarts was the sponsor for the first seven seasons, and Guitar Hero was added for the seventh season tour. M&M's Pretzel Chocolate Candies was a sponsor of the ninth season tour. The fifth season tour was the most successful tour with gross of over $35 million.[347] However no concert tour was organized in the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons, the only seasons not to have an associated tour.[348] The sixteenth season tour featured the band In Real Life as an opener on select dates.[349]\nIdol Gives Back was a special charity event started in season six featuring performances by celebrities and various fund-raising initiatives. This event was also held in seasons seven and nine and has raised nearly $185 million in total.[95]\nAmerican Idol has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants' performances as well as the winner's coronation single for sale. For the first five seasons, the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season. All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made then American Idol the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program.[350] Starting late in the fifth season, individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads, initially from the American Idol official website only. In the seventh season the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor. In the tenth season the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night.\nOn February 14, 2009, The Walt Disney Company debuted \"The American Idol Experience\" at its Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. In this live production, co-produced by 19 Entertainment, park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the Idol set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real Idol judges, critiqued the performances.[352] Audience members then voted for their favorite performer. There were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a \"finals\" show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner.[353] The winner of the finals show received a \"Dream Ticket\" that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future American Idol audition.[352] The attraction closed on August 30, 2014.[354]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(May 2021)\nAmerican Idol is broadcast to over 100 nations worldwide.[355] In most nations these are not live broadcasts and may be tape delayed by several days or weeks, except for other season finales that are aired live in several countries simulcast with the U.S. broadcast on Fox (2002\u20132016) and ABC (since 2018). In Canada, the first thirteen seasons of American Idol were aired live countrywide by CTV and/or CTV Two, in simulcast with Fox. CTV dropped Idol after its thirteenth season and in August 2014, Yes TV announced that it had picked up Canadian rights to American Idol beginning in its 2015 season.[356][357] In 2017, it was announced the show would return to CTV Two for its sixteenth season.[358] Since season nineteen, the show started airing on Citytv.\nIn Latin America, the show is broadcast and subtitled by Sony Entertainment Television.

In Italy, the twelfth season was broadcast by La3.[360] In Singapore, The show was broadcast on Mediacorp Channel 5 for the ninth and tenth seasons.\n^American Idol does not have a ranking for the 2001\u20132002 season because it aired in the summer of 2002. If it had aired within the official 2001\u20132002 U.S. television season, the Wednesday results show would have ranked number 25 and the Tuesday performance show would have ranked number 30, assuming it would have had the same rating as it did in the summer.",

        "context": "\nAmerican Idol was based on the British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition Popstars. Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain.[6] Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, including telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows, such as the Eurovision Song Contest), the drama of backstories, and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time.[7]Pop Idol debuted in Britain in 2001 with Lythgoe as showrunner\u200d\u2014\u200cthe executive producer and production leader\u200d\u2014\u200cand Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was successful with the viewing public.[8]\nIn 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the United States, but the idea was initially met with poor responses from all the television networks including Fox.[9] However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was later persuaded to buy the series by his daughter, Elisabeth, who had seen the British show.[9] Although Fox's executives wanted to change the format, Murdoch insisted that it should remain the same as the British one. One change was nevertheless made due to the presence of multiple time zones in the United States that made it impractical for the country to vote in the same time period, an additional half-hour results show was therefore added the day following the performance show.[10] The show was renamed American Idol: The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job of showrunner, but turned down the offer; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to the surprise of Cowell and Fox, it became one of the biggest shows of the summer.[11][12] With its successful launch in the summer, the show was then moved to January and expanded.[13] The show grew into a phenomenon largely due to its personal engagement with the contestants by prompting the viewers to vote, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show on U.S. television, a position it then held for seven consecutive seasons until 2011.[14][15]\nHowever, after a few years of sharp declining ratings starting in 2012, with rating falls of over 20% each season,[16] the fifteenth season would be its last on Fox, ending its run in April 2016.[17] In May 2017, ABC acquired the rights to the series and the program returned for the 2017\u201318 television season.[18][19] The first season of the revived series, or the 16th season overall, started airing in March 2018.[20] Six seasons have been aired on ABC as of May 2023.[21]\nThe show had originally planned on having four judges following the Pop Idol format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell.[9] A fourth judge, radio DJ Stryker, was originally chosen but he dropped out citing \"image concerns.\"[22] In the second season, New York radio personality Angie Martinez had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew only after a few days of auditions due to not being comfortable with giving out criticism.[23] The show decided to continue with the three judges format until the eighth season. All three original judges stayed on the judging panel for eight seasons.\nIn the eighth season, Latin Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge. Abdul left the show in 2009 after the eighth season as a result of failing to agree to terms with the show producers.[24]Emmy Award-winning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul for the ninth season, but left in 2010 after just one season.[25] DioGuardi was let go from American Idol in 2010 after two seasons as producers favored a return to the three-person judge panel previously used prior to DioGuardi's appearance on the show.[26] Cowell also left the show in 2010 to introduce the American version of his show The X Factor for 2011.[27] Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth.\nJennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined the judging panel in the tenth season,[28] but both left in 2012 after two seasons.[29] Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. They were replaced by three new judges, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, and Keith Urban, who joined Jackson in the twelfth season.[30] However, both Carey and Minaj left after one season,[31] and Jackson departed the show after twelve seasons as a judge but would return as a mentor for the thirteenth season in 2014, after which he left the show permanently.[32][33]\nUrban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Lopez returned to American Idol for the thirteenth season and was joined by former mentor Harry Connick Jr.[1] After this, Lopez, Urban, and Connick Jr. remained on the show until its cancellation after the fifteenth season in 2016.[34][35]\nThe first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman following the format of Pop Idol of using two presenters. Dunkleman quit thereafter,[40] resulting in Seacrest becoming the sole host starting with the second season in 2003.\nSeacrest has remained as sole host of American Idol ever since, with the exception of the two-year hiatus between 2016 and 2018 as well as April 8, 2019, when Bobby Bones subbed for Seacrest after the latter fell ill.[41] Dunkleman did, however, return for the initial series finale on Fox in 2016 as a guest.[42]\nThe eligible age-range for contestants is fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in the fourth season, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in the tenth season. The contestants have to be legal U.S. residents, can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons, and must not have held a current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage[43] (in previous years by the audition stage).[44]\nFor the first eighteen seasons, contestants went through at least three sets of cuts. The first was a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these made it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sing in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television.[45] Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10 and 60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood (the average total is between 150 and 200)[citation needed].\nFrom the nineteenth season onwards, contestants request a Zoom interview and audition remotely for the show's producers. If the audition goes well, they will then invite the contestants to audition in front of the judges, in one of the audition cities.[46]\nOnce in Hollywood, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until the tenth season, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood.[47] In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and performed a song together.[48] In the final round, the contestants performed solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band\u200d\u2014\u200cdepending on the season. In the second and third seasons, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In the seventh season, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round.[49] In the twelfth season, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.\nIn the tenth and eleventh seasons, a further round was added in Las Vegas, where the contestants performed in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists.[50][51] At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants were selected to move on to the semi-final stage. In the twelfth season the Las Vegas round became a Sudden Death round, where the judges had to choose five guys and five girls each night (four nights) to make the top twenty.[52] In the thirteenth season, the Las Vegas round was eliminated and a new round called \"Hollywood or Home\" was added, where if the judges were uncertain about some contestants, those contestants were required to perform soon after landing in Los Angeles, and those who failed to impress were sent back home before they reached Hollywood.[53] In the fourteenth season, the \"Hollywood or Home\" round was dropped, and a Showcase round was added, where the contestants performed at the House of Blues or auditorium for the judges and a live audience, and these performances determine who makes into the Top 24.[54] In the seventeenth and eighteenth seasons, the showcase round took place in Hawaii. In the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first seasons, a showstopper round was used.\nFrom the semi-finals onward, the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a toll-free telephone number for each contestant was displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message was registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers were allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window. However, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers.[55] One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges. Over 110 million votes were cast in the first season, and by the tenth season the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million. Voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when AT&T Wireless joined as a sponsor of the show, and 7.5 million text messages were sent to American Idol that season.[56] The number of text messages rapidly increased, reaching 178 million texts by the eighth season.[57] Online voting was offered for the first time in the tenth season. The votes are counted and verified by Telescope Inc.[58]\nIn the first three seasons, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In the first season, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In the second and third seasons, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. These seasons also featured a wildcard round, where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In the first season, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In the second and third seasons, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all.\nFrom the fourth through seventh and ninth seasons, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.\nThe wildcard round returned in the eighth season, wherein there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward \u2013 the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer \u2013 for each night, and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. Starting in tenth season, the girls and boys perform on separate nights. In the tenth and eleventh seasons, five of each gender were chosen, and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13. In the twelfth season, the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups, with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10. In the thirteenth season, there were thirty semifinalists, but only twenty semifinalists (ten for each gender) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows, with five in each gender based on the vote and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13. In the fourteenth season, the top 24 performed at The Fillmore Detroit, starting with the 12 males on one night and then the 12 females on the next night. The following week, the same order went for the top 16, with four males eliminated, followed by four females based on the vote. Then, on the first night of finals, a similar sequence from the thirteenth season was used to determine the final 12, with five of each gender based on the vote and two wildcards chosen by the judges. In the fifteenth season, the top 24 performed at Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in Los Angeles and were split into two groups of twelve and performed twice, one being a solo performance and one being a duet with a former Idol contestant. In each group, the judges chose 7 contestants to advance to the top 14 where the judges chose 4 to advance to the top 10 and remaining 6 contestants were chosen based on the vote. In the sixteenth season, the top 24 performed at the Academy in the Heart of LA, and the show repeated the process from the previous season. However, instead of Idol alumnus as duet partners, superstar celebrity singers were used as the duet partners. In the seventeenth season, the same process was repeated again. However, instead of a top 24, it's a top 20, the contestants performed at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, and performed solos in one episode, and performed the duets in two episodes. In the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the top 20 performed at their homes, and based on the vote, half of the top 20 would advance to the top 10, and the other half would be eliminated. However, a wild card was given to one of the bottom 10 to save them from elimination.[59][60] In the nineteenth season, the show used a combination of the process from the sixteenth and fourteenth seasons. In the twentieth season, the show repeated the process from the previous season, but they used a top 20 instead of a top 16, and there were no all star duets. In the twenty-first season, the same process was repeated, but they started with a top 26 instead of a top 24.\nThe finals are broadcast in primetime from Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience (except the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). From 2002 to 2022, the venue was CBS Television City. Starting in 2023, it changed to Red Studios. The finals lasted eight weeks in the first season. From the second to ninth and fourteenth seasons, the finals lasted eleven weeks. The tenth and eleventh seasons lasted for twelve weeks, while the twelfth season lasted for ten weeks. In the thirteenth season, the finals lasted thirteen weeks. The finals lasted seven weeks in the fifteenth season, and six weeks in the sixteenth season. Each finalist performs songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as Motown, disco, or big band, songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley or The Beatles, or more general themes such as Billboard number-one hits or songs from the contestant's year of birth. Contestants usually worked with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. From the tenth to twelfth seasons, Jimmy Iovine was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sang one song each week, but this was increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.\nThe most popular contestants are usually not revealed in the results show. Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes was called to the center of the stage. One of these three was usually sent to safety; however the two remaining were not necessarily the bottom two.[61] The contestant with the fewest votes was then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant's time on the show was played and they gave their final performance (from the fourteenth season onward, the montage and the final performance were dropped). However, in the sixth season, during the series' first ever Idol Gives Back episode, no contestant was eliminated, but on the following week, two were sent home. Moreover, from the eighth season onwards, the judges may overturn viewers' decision with a \"Judges' Save\" if they unanimously agreed to. \"The save\" could only be used once, and only up through the Top 5. In the eighth to tenth and fourteenth seasons, a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save, but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons, a regular single elimination took place. The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently, a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week.\nThe \"Fan Save\" was introduced in the fourteenth season. During the finals, viewers were given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 8.\nDuring the original run of American Idol on Fox, the finale week consisted of a one-hour long final performance night and a two-hour last episode of the season that culminates in revealing the winner, both of which are broadcast live in the U.S. Eastern and Central time zones. For the first, third through sixth and fourteenth through fifteenth seasons it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The second-season finale took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre, which had an audience capacity of over 6,000. In the seventh through thirteenth seasons, the venue was at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live, which holds an audience of over 7,000. Since the show's reboot on ABC, the venue remains the same throughout the entire show (excluding auditions), but has been stretched to a single three-hour season finale that is annually aired live simultaneously in all U.S. territories. The eighteenth-season finale was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe winner usually receives a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums,[62][63] and secures a management contract with American Idol-affiliated 19 Management (which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts. All winners prior to the ninth season reportedly earned at least $1 million in their first year as winner.[63] At first the contract came with a $250,000-plus advance, but dropped to about $62,500 over the Fox years.[64] All the runners-up of the first ten seasons, as well as some of other finalists, had also received record deals with major labels. However, starting in the eleventh season, the runner-up may only be guaranteed a single-only deal.[65]BMG/Sony (first through ninth seasons), UMG (tenth through fifteenth seasons), and Disney Music Group's Hollywood Records (sixteenth through eighteenth seasons) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season's finale. In the fourteenth and fifteenth seasons, the winner was signed with Big Machine Records. Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants' albums, such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. All top 10 (11 in the tenth and twelfth seasons, 5 in the fourteenth season, and 7 in the sixteenth season) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour, where the participants may each earn a six-figure sum.[66]\n^Owing to the production difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the finale had five contestants instead of three, and the three contestants who failed to place in the top 2 finished in joint-third place.\nEach season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round from the tenth through twelfth seasons), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinals onward the contestants perform their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed during a results segment. The results segment feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results also features homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner of the season is revealed.\nWith the exception of the first two seasons, the contestants in the semifinals onward perform in front of a studio audience. They perform with a full band in the finals. The current musical director is Kris Pooley, who has been with the show since the sixteenth season. In previous seasons, the American Idol band was led by Rickey Minor (fourth through ninth and thirteenth through fifteenth seasons) and Ray Chew (tenth through twelfth seasons). Assistance has also been given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and Debra Byrd to contestants behind the scene. Starting with the seventh season, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onward. In later seasons, the contestants were allowed to perform with a musical instrument in the auditions. During the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays from the tenth through thirteenth seasons, with the tenth, eleventh and thirteenth season finales aired on Tuesday and Wednesday. From the fourteenth season onward, there were no separate results shows. On the fourteenth season, the show aired on Wednesday nights, and on the fifteenth season, Thursday nights. From the sixteenth season onward, it aired on Sundays and Mondays.[citation needed]\nThe first season of American Idol debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell served as judges.\nIn the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital.[67]Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed on his blog, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.[68]\nIn what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, \"A Moment Like This\", went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, From Justin to Kelly, which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become one of the most successful Idol contestants internationally,[70] with worldwide album sales of more than 25 million.[71]\nFollowing the success of the first season, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show's budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Ryan Seacrest as the lone host. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Kristin Adams was a correspondent for this season.[72]\nCorey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation.[73] Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year \u2013 Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and Frenchie Davis for having previously modeled for an adult website.[74]\nThe season finale drew more than 38 million viewers, marking Idol's biggest audience ever for a single episode. Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner, beating Clay Aiken by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through.[75] In an interview prior to the fifth season, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.[76]\nBoth finalists found success after the show, but Aiken out-performed Studdard's coronation song \"Flying Without Wings\" with his single release from the show \"This Is the Night\", as well as in their subsequent album releases. The fourth-place finisher Josh Gracin also enjoyed some success as a country singer.[77]\nThe third season premiered on January 19, 2004. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\" received widespread attention. His exposure on Idol landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third bestselling singer from that season.[78]\nMuch media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated.[79] Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes \"incredibly racist\".[80] The prolonged stays of John Stevens and Jasmine Trias in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke 'blown out of proportion'.[81]\nThe performance of \"Summertime\" by Barrino, later known simply as \"Fantasia\", at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite Idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show.[82] Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single \"I Believe\", a song co-written by the first season finalist Tamyra Gray, and DeGarmo released \"Dreams\".\nThe fourth season premiered on January 18, 2005. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This was the first full season of the series to be aired in high definition; the finale of the third season was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season,[44] and among those who benefited from this new rule were Constantine Maroulis and Bo Bice, the two rockers of the show.\nThe top 12 finalists originally included Mario Vazquez, but he dropped out citing 'personal reasons'[83] and was replaced by Nikko Smith. Later, an employee of Fremantle Media, which produces the show, sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by Vazquez toward him during the show.[84]\nDuring the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.\nIn May 2005, Carrie Underwood was announced the winner, with Bice the runner-up. Both Underwood and Bice released the coronation song \"Inside Your Heaven\", with Underwood's version of the song making her the first country artist ever to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[85] As of 2015, Underwood has become the most successful Idol contestant in the U.S.,[70] selling 16 million albums in the country,[86] while selling a total of 65 million records worldwide.[87]\nThe fifth season began on January 17, 2006. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. It remains the highest-rated season in the show's run so far. Two of the more prominent contestants during the Hollywood round were the Brittenum twins who were later disqualified for identity theft.[88]\nChris Daughtry's performance of Fuel's \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\" on the show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new lead singer, an invitation he declined.[89] His performance of Live's version of \"I Walk the Line\" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters for not crediting the arrangement to Live.[90] He was eliminated at the top four in a shocking result.\nThe sixth season began on Tuesday, January 16, 2007. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The premiere drew a massive audience of 37.3 million viewers, peaking in the last half hour with more than 41 million viewers.[92]\nTeenager Sanjaya Malakar was the season's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo,[93] and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog Vote for the Worst and satellite radio personality Howard Stern, who both encouraged fans to vote for him. However, on the Top 7 results, Sanjaya was voted off.[94]\nThis season saw the first Idol Gives Back telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76 million in corporate and viewer donations.[95] No contestant was eliminated that week, but two (Phil Stacey and Chris Richardson) were eliminated the next.\nThis season also saw the launch of the American Idol Songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the \"coronation song\". Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, \"This Is My Now\", was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by Sparks on May 24, 2007.[96]\nThe seventh season premiered on January 15, 2008, for a two-day, four-hour premiere. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The media focused on the professional status of the seventh season contestants, the so-called 'ringers',[97] many of whom, including Kristy Lee Cook, Brooke White, Michael Johns, and in particular Carly Smithson, had prior recording contracts.[98] Contestant David Hernandez also attracted some attention due to his past employment as a stripper.[99]\nFor the finals, American Idol debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. David Cook's performance of \"Billie Jean\" on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the Chris Cornell arrangement to be David Cook's own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell's version. Cornell himself said he was 'flattered' and praised David Cook's performance.[100] David Cook was taken to the hospital after the top-nine performance show due to heart palpitations and high blood pressure.[101]\nDavid Archuleta's performance of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in the tenth season, called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget.[102]Jason Castro's semi-final performance of \"Hallelujah\" also received considerable attention, and it propelled Jeff Buckley's version of the song to the top of the Billboarddigital song chart.[103] This was the first season in which contestants' recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts.[104]\nIdol Gives Back returned on April 9, 2008, and raised $64 million for charity.[95]\nThe finalists were Cook and Archuleta. David Cook was announced the winner on May 21, 2008, the first rocker to win the show. Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S.[91]\nThe American Idol Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the \"coronation song\". The winning song, \"The Time of My Life\", was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008.\nThe eighth season premiered on January 13, 2009. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This season featured the first major change to the judging panel; a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced. Mike Darnell, the president of alternative programming for Fox, stated that the season would focus more on the contestants' personal life.[105]\nThis was also the first season without executive producer Nigel Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show So You Think You Can Dance.[106] The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. Idol Gives Back was canceled for this season due to the global recession at the time.\nThere were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the \"Judges' Save\", and Matt Giraud was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated.\nThe two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since the second season. It was claimed,[107] and then later retracted,[108] that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from Allen's home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.[109]\nBoth Allen and Lambert released the coronation song, \"No Boundaries\" which was co-written by DioGuardi. This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status.[110]\nThe ninth season premiered on January 12, 2010. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Kara DioGuardi, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Paula Abdul left the show and Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week. One of the most prominent auditioners this season was General Larry Platt whose performance of \"Pants on the Ground\" became a viral hit song.[111]\nCrystal Bowersox, who has Type-I diabetes, fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized.[112] The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer, wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.[112]\nMichael Lynche was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges' Save. The next week Katie Stevens and Andrew Garcia were eliminated. That week, Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first Idol alum to do so. Idol Gives Back returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised $45 million.[95]\nA special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show's past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.\nThe final two contestants were Lee DeWyze and Bowersox. DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song \u2013 DeWyze chose U2's \"Beautiful Day\", and Bowersox chose Patty Griffin's \"Up to the Mountain\". This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.[113]\nThe tenth season premiered on January 19, 2011. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the American version of The X Factor), Kara DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres, who left the show on her own accord.[114][28]\nRandy Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth. Nigel Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the new partner of American Idol, acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors,[28] although in later episodes special guest mentors such as Beyonc\u00e9, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in.\nThe tenth season is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40-second video audition via Myspace.[115]Karen Rodriguez was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds.\nOne of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina, whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fianc\u00e9e received widespread coverage.[116] Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. Casey Abrams, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. In the following week, Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated.\nPia Toscano, one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticisms from some former Idol contestants, as well as actor Tom Hanks.[117] After Idol, Jennifer Lopez helped guide her career.[118]\nThe two finalists in 2011 were Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery, both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win American Idol. McCreery released his first single, \"I Love You This Big\", as his coronation song, and Alaina released \"Like My Mother Does\". McCreery's debut album, Clear as Day, became the first debut album by an Idol winner to reach No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 since Ruben Studdard's Soulful in 2003, and he became the youngest male artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200.[119]\nThe eleventh season premiered on January 18, 2012. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, and Randy Jackson returned as judges. One more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25, which was later revealed to be Jermaine Jones. However, on March 14, Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants. Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests.[120]\nFinalist Phillip Phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to the hospital before the Top 13 results show, and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones.[121] He was reported to have eight surgeries during his Idol run, and had considered quitting the show due to the pain.[122] He underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished.[123]\nJessica Sanchez received the fewest votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their \"save\" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, Colton Dixon was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.\nPhillips became the winner, beating Sanchez. During the finale, fifth season finalist Ace Young proposed marriage to third season runner-up Diana DeGarmo on stage \u2013 which she accepted.[124]\nPhillips released \"Home\" as his coronation song, while Sanchez released \"Change Nothing\". Phillips' \"Home\" has since become the best selling of all coronation songs, with over 5 million copies sold.[125][126]\nThe twelfth season premiered on January 16, 2013. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. Randy Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. This season's judging panel consisted of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj.\nThis was the first season since the ninth season to have four judges on the panel. The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to TMZ.[127]\nThe top 10 contestants started with five males and five females, however, the males were eliminated consecutively in the first five weeks, with Lazaro Arbos the last male to be eliminated. For the first time in the show's history, the top 5 contestants were all female. It was also the first time that the judges' \"save\" was not used, the top four contestants were therefore given an extra week to perform again with their votes carried over with no elimination in the first week.\n23-year-old Candice Glover won the season with Kree Harrison taking the runner-up spot. Glover is the first female to win American Idol since Jordin Sparks. Glover released \"I Am Beautiful\" as a single while Harrison released \"All Cried Out\" immediately after the show. Glover sold poorly with her debut album, and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label.[128]\nTowards the end of the season, Randy Jackson, the last remaining of the original judges, announced he would no longer serve as a judge to pursue other business ventures.[32] Both judges Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj also decided to leave after one season to focus on their music careers.[31]\nThe thirteenth season premiered on January 15, 2014. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Keith Urban returned as a judge. Urban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Randy Jackson returned, though Jackson moved from the judging panel to the role of in-mentor. Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj left the panel after one season. Former judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick, Jr. joined Urban on the panel. Connick Jr. served as a mentor for Idol in 2010 and 2012.[129] Also, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick were replaced as executive producers by Per Blankens, Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Pragger. Bill DeRonde replaced Warwick as a director of the audition episodes, while Louis J. Horvitz replaced Gregg Gelfand as a director of the show.[130]\nThis was the first season where the contestants were permitted to perform in the final rounds songs they wrote themselves. In the Top 8, Sam Woolf received the fewest votes, but he was saved from elimination by the judges. The 500th episode of the series was the Top 3 performance night.[131]\nThe fourteenth season premiered on January 7, 2015. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick, Jr. returned for their respective fourth, third and second seasons as judges. Eighth season runner-up Adam Lambert filled in for Urban during the New York City auditions. Randy Jackson did not return as the in-house mentor and left the show permanently.[134]Scott Borchetta replaced Jackson as the mentor.\nChanges this season include only airing one episode a week during the final ten.[135] Coca-Cola ended their longtime sponsorship of the show[136] and Ford Motor Company maintained a reduced role. The winner of the season also received a recording contract with Big Machine Records.\nNick Fradiani won the season, defeating Clark Beckham. Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region. Fradiani released \"Beautiful Life\" as his coronation single while Beckham released \"Champion\". Jax, the third place finalist, also released a single called \"Forcefield\".\nFox announced on May 11, 2015, that the fifteenth season would be the final season of American Idol; as such, the season was expected to have an additional focus on the program's alumni. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, with Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez all returning as judges.[17] The fifteenth season premiered on January 6, 2016. The season was shortened by four weeks compared to previous years.[137] During the finale episode, President Barack Obama praised the millions of young people that voted for contestants and pitched that they vote in the upcoming election. The farewell season concluded on April 7, 2016. Seacrest signed off by saying: \"And one more time\u2014this is so tough\u2014we say to you from Hollywood, goodnight America\", and then he added, \"for now.\"[138]\nIn early 2017, Variety reported that Fremantle Media was in talks to revive the show for NBC or for its original network, Fox.[142] A dispute between Fremantle and Core Media Group derailed these plans.[143] In May 2017, ABC was making a bid to revive the program.[144] ABC acquired the rights to the series, and American Idol returned for the 2017\u201318 television season.[145][146]\nIn July 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would return as host,[147] and by September 2017 it was revealed that Katy Perry,[36]Luke Bryan[37] and Lionel Richie would serve as judges.[38][148] The sixteenth season premiered on March 11, 2018.[20] This was the first season of American Idol to air on ABC. The season was again shortened compared to the previous season to twelve weeks, with multiple elimination in the final rounds. Unlike previous seasons where only two finalists remained in the final episode, three finalists performed in the finale. On May 21, 2018, the season concluded with Maddie Poppe crowned the winner, beating Caleb Lee Hutchinson as runner-up and Gabby Barrett in third place. Her winning song was \"Going, Going, Gone\". Caleb Lee Hutchinson released \"Johnny Cash Heart\" as a single, while Gabby Barrett's song was \"Rivers Deep\".[149]\nABC renewed the revival series for another season. Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[150] The seventeenth season premiered on March 3, 2019. For the finale, the show no longer features separate performance and result shows. On May 19, 2019, the season concluded with three finalists, with Madison VanDenburg eliminated in third place after performing two songs, and the final two performing their last song. For the first time, there were no separate performance and grand finale shows this season. Laine Hardy was crowned the winner and Alejandro Aranda runner-up. Hardy released a single, \"Flame\", immediately after the win, but Aranda did not.[151][152] However, Aranda later released a song he performed in the finale, \"Tonight\", under the name Scarypoolparty on June 28, 2019.[153]\nOn May 13, 2019, the series was renewed for an eighteenth season and it premiered on February 16, 2020.[154][155] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[156] For the first time, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, from the top 20 to the finale, the contestants performed in their own homes, while Ryan Seacrest hosted the show remotely in his own home in Los Angeles with the judges also in their respective homes.[60][157] The season was also further truncated, with the top 5 performing in the finale. Each finalist also performed only two songs for the finale.[158] On May 17, the season concluded, with Just Sam crowned as the winner, with Arthur Gunn finishing as the runner-up.[159] \"Rise Up\", the song Just Sam performed for their audition and reprised on the finale, was released as their debut song.[160][161]\nOn May 15, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a nineteenth season and it premiered on February 14, 2021.[162][163] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[164] Later in October, it was announced that Bobby Bones will return as mentor. On May 23, the season concluded, with Chayce Beckham crowned the winner, with Willie Spence finishing as the runner-up. \"23\", the song Chayce Beckham wrote and performed for Top 4, was released as his debut song.[21]\nOn May 13, 2021, ABC renewed the series for a twentieth season and it premiered on February 27, 2022.[165][166] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[167] On December 31, it was announced that Bones would not be returning as a mentor.[168] On May 22, the season concluded, with Noah Thompson crowned as the winner, with HunterGirl finishing as the runner-up. \"One Day Tonight\", the song Noah Thompson performed for the Grand Finale, was released as his debut song.\nOn May 13, 2022, ABC renewed the series for a twenty-first season and it premiered on February 19, 2023.[169][170] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges. On May 21, the season concluded, with Iam Tongi crowned as the winner, with Megan Danielle finishing as the runner-up.\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of American Idol. It holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in the Nielsen annual television ratings; it became the highest-rated of all television programs in the United States overall for an unprecedented seven consecutive years,[173] or eight consecutive (and total) years when either its performance or result show was ranked number one overall.[5]\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\nAmerican Idol premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002. The first show drew 9.9 million viewers, giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30 pm spot in over a year.[239] The audience steadily grew, and by finale night, the audience had averaged 23 million, with more than 40 million watching some part of that show.[240] That episode was placed third amongst all age groups, but more importantly it led in the 18\u201349 demographic, the age group most valued by advertisers.[12]\nThe growth continued into the next season, starting with a season premiere of 26.5 million.[174] The season attracted an average of 21.7 million viewers, and was placed second overall amongst the 18\u201349 age group.[241] The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest-rated ever American Idol episode at 38.1 million for the final hour.[242] By the third season, the show had become the top show in the 18\u201349 demographic[242] a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including the tenth season, and its competition stages ranked first in the nationwide overall ratings. By the fourth season, American Idol had become the most-watched series amongst all viewers on American TV for the first time, with an average viewership of 26.8 million.[243] The show reached its peak in the fifth season with numbers averaging 30.6 million per episode, and this season remains the highest-rated of the series.[243]\nThe sixth season premiered with the series' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most-watched episodes of American Idol. During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before,[3] as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC's The Cosby Show. The show was dubbed \"the Death Star\",[92] and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses.[3] However, the sixth season also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year. The sixth season was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second-highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.[242]\nThe loss of viewers continued into the seventh season. The premiere was down 11% among total viewers,[174] and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest-rated Wednesday show among the 18\u201334 demo since the first season in 2002.[244] However, the ratings rebounded for the seventh-season finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids, and improved over the sixth season as the series' third most watched finale. The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most watched TV network in the country for the first time since its inception, a first ever in American television history for a non-Big Three major broadcast network.[245] Overall ratings for the season were down 10% from the sixth season,[246] which is in line with the fall in viewership across all networks due in part to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike.[247]\nThe declining trend however continued into the eighth season, as total viewers numbers fell by 5\u201310% for early episodes compared to the seventh season,[248] and by 9% for the finale.[175] In the ninth season, Idol's six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken, when NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 17 beat Idol in the same time slot with 30.1 million viewers over Idol's 18.4 million.[249] Nevertheless, American Idol overall finished its ninth season as the most watched TV series for the sixth year running, breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by CBS' All in the Family and NBC's The Cosby Show.[250]\nIn the tenth season, the total viewer numbers for the first week of shows fell 12\u201313%, and by up to 23% in the 18\u201349 demo compared to the ninth season.[196] Later episodes, however, retained viewers better, and the season ended on a high with a significant increase in viewership for the finale \u2013 up 12% for the adults 18\u201349 demographic and a 21% increase in total viewers from the ninth-season finale.[251] While the overall viewer number has increased this season, its viewer demographics have continued to age year on year \u2013 the median age this season was 47.2 compared to a median age of 32.1 in its first season.[252] The demographics also became \"whiter\" over time and less diverse.[253] Nevertheless, in the 2010\u201311 television season, Fox maintained its lead on over other networks with its seventh consecutive season of victory overall in the 18\u201349 demographic ratings in the United States.\nThe eleventh season, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as The Voice and The X Factor.[254] The ratings for the first two episodes of the eleventh season fell 16\u201321% in overall viewer numbers and 24\u201327% in the 18/49 demo,[200] while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18\u201349 demo.[201] The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. For the first time in eight years, American Idol lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to NBC Sunday Night Football, although the strengths of Idol in its second year in the Wednesday-Thursday primetime slots helped Fox achieve the longest period of 18\u201349 demographic victory in the Nielsen ratings, standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012.[202]\nThe loss of viewers continued into the twelfth season, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18\u201349 demo.[255] The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18\u201349 demo.[256] The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season.[257] The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18\u201349 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and American Idol lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013\u201314 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, and never regained its Top 10 position by the series' end in 2016.[34]\nThe continuing decline influenced further changes for the fourteenth season, including the loss of Coca-Cola as the show's major sponsor, and a decision to only broadcast one, two-hour show per week during the top 12 rounds (with results from the previous week integrated into the performance show, rather than having a separate results show).[258][35][259] On May 11, 2015, prior to the fourteenth-season finale, Fox announced that the fifteenth season of American Idol would be its last.[17] Despite these changes, the show's ratings would decline more sharply. The fourteenth-season finale was the lowest-rated finale ever, with an average of only 8.03 million viewers watching the finale. The show's ratings, however, rebounded in its final season and ended its run in 2016 as Fox's first-ever program to conclude its run without dropping from the Nielsen Top 30 most-watched television shows in each of its seasons.\nFor the revived series on ABC, the ratings were lower but remained stable compared to previous seasons on Fox. The finale of the seventeenth season was slightly more watched than the sixteenth.[260]\nEarly reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\".[261] Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\".[12] It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\",[262] and \"a romp in humiliation\".[263] Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted,[264] and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\".[265] The decision to send the first season winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"[266]\nSome of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of Entertainment Weekly, thought that \"for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, Idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business.\"[267] Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show \"undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism\".[268] Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has \"reshaped the American songbook\", \"led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture\", and connects \"the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future.\"[269] Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that \"Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him.\"[270] Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self-respect.[271]\nSome in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show. Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the \"true art form of music\", thought that shows like American Idol made it seem \"so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight\", and that \"television is a lie\".[272] Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol \"isn't really about music. It's about all the bad aspects of the music business \u2013 the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.' \"[273] That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that \"Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award\".[274] It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol, commenting on talent shows in general, said that \"there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs\".[275]American Idol revolutionized American pop culture and the pop idol process and has provided an opportunity for many to bypass the small club scene and allow a much larger audience to participate in and select the next potential chart topping performer.[276]\nThe success of the show's alumni, however, has led to a more positive assessment of the show, and the show was described as having \"proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records\".[277] While the industry is divided on the show success, its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format.[278] According to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, \"if you want to try and get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV, Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone\", and that country music and Idol \"go together well\".[279]\nThroughout the series, twelve of the seventeen Idol winners, including its first five, had come from the Southern United States.[284] A large number of other finalists during the series' run have also hailed from the American South, including Clay Aiken, Kellie Pickler, and Chris Daughtry,[284] who are all from North Carolina. In 2012, an analysis of the 131 contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that 48% have some connection to the Southern United States.[285]\nThe show itself was popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch American Idol during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as Kentucky, were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series.[284] Data from Nielsen SoundScan, a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47 million CDs sold by Idol contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.[284]\nTheories given for the success of Southerners on Idol have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the Bible Belt, where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing.[284][286][287] Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride.[288] According to fifth season winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of Alabama, \"People in the South have a lot of pride ... So, they're adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region.\"[284]\nFor five consecutive seasons, starting in the seventh season, the title was given to a white male who plays the guitar \u2013 a trend that Idol pundits call the \"White guy with guitar\" or \"WGWG\" factor.[289] Just hours before the eleventh-season finale, where Phillip Phillips was named the winner, Richard Rushfield, author of the book American Idol: The Untold Story, said, \"You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it, not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star competing on the contemporary radio, but as .... who's the nicest guy in a popularity contest\", he says, \"And that has led to this dynasty of four, and possibly now five, consecutive, affable, very nice, good-looking white boys.\"[289]\nSome fans call the final performance of the night the \"pimp spot\" because it usually receives a big boost in votes, due to the recency effect. By performing first, a performer may benefit from the primacy effect, but any other early performance may be stifled. The second performance spot is sometimes called the \"un-pimp spot\" because it is the least beneficial.[290]\nThe show was criticized in earlier seasons over the onerous contract contestants had to sign that gave excessive control to 19 Entertainment over their future careers[291] and handed a large part of their future earnings to the management.[292][293]\nIndividual contestants have generated controversy in this competition for their past actions[74][294] or for being 'ringers' planted by the producers.[97] A number of contestants have been disqualified for various reasons, such as for having an existing contract or undisclosed criminal record, although the show has also been accused of a double standard for disqualifying some but not others.[295]\nVoting results have been a consistent source of controversy. The mechanism of voting has aroused considerable criticism, most notably in the second season when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote,[75] and in the eighth season, when the massive increase in text votes[57] fueled the texting controversy.[109] Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the first season.[296] Since 2004, votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol and Vote for the Worst.[citation needed]\nThe enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated were transformative for the Fox Broadcasting Company. American Idol and other shows such as Survivor and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire were credited for expanding reality television programming in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, and Idol became the most watched non-scripted primetime television series, which it remained for almost a decade, from 2003 to 2012, breaking records on U.S. television (dominated by drama shows and sitcoms in the preceding decades).[297]\nThe show pushed Fox to become the number one U.S. TV network among adults aged 18\u201349,[298] the key demographic coveted by advertisers, for an unprecedented eight consecutive years by 2012.[299] Its success also helped lift the ratings of other shows that were scheduled around it such as House and Bones, and Idol, for years, was Fox's strongest platform primetime television program for promoting eventual hit shows of the 2010s (of the same network) such as Glee, New Girl and Empire.[3] The show, its creator Simon Fuller claimed, \"saved Fox\".[300]\nAs one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, American Idol has had a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment.[305][306] It helped create a number of highly successful recording artists, such as Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Carrie Underwood, as well as others of varying notability. The alumni of the show have received between them 54 Grammy nominations and 13 Grammy awards by 2016, with Carrie Underwood winning seven.[307][308]\nVarious American Idol alumni had success on various record charts around the world; in the U.S. they had achieved 345 number ones on the Billboardcharts in its first 10 years,[4] and 458 by its last year of broadcast in 2016, with 100 achieved by Kelly Clarkson alone.[309] According to Fred Bronson, author of books on the Billboard charts, no other entity has ever created as many hit-making artists and bestselling albums and singles.[310] In 2007, American Idol alums accounted for 2.1% of all music sales.[311] Its alumni have a massive impact on radio; in 2007, American Idol had become \"a dominant force in radio\" according to Rich Meyer, president of the radio station monitoring research company Mediabase.[312] By 2010, four winners each had more than a million radio spins, with Kelly Clarkson leading the field with over four million spins.[313]\nAt the end of the show's run on Fox in 2016, Idol's contestants have sold more than 60 million albums in the US, resulting in more than 80 Platinum records and 95 Gold records. Its participants have generated more than 450 Billboard No. 1 hits and sold more than 260 million digital downloads.[314]\nThe impact of American Idol was also strongly felt in musical theater, where many of Idol alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former American Idol contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on.[315][316] The casting of a popular Idol contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd,[317] won a role in Dreamgirls and eventually went on to win an Academy Award for her performance. She later became the show's first and only alumnus ever to win the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony).\nThe dominance of American Idol in the ratings had made it the most profitable show in U.S. TV for many years. The show was estimated to generate $900 million for the year 2004 through sales of TV ads, albums, merchandise and concert tickets.[300] By the seventh season, the show was estimated to earn around $900 million from its ad revenue alone, not including ancillary sponsorship deals and other income.[320][321] One estimate puts the total TV revenue for the first eight seasons of American at $6.4 billion.[322] Sponsors that bought fully integrated packages can expect a variety of promotions of their products on the show, such as product placement, adverts and product promotion integrated into the show, and various promotional opportunities.[323] Other off-air promotional partners pay for the rights to feature \"Idol\" branding on their packaging, products and marketing programs.[324]American Idol also partnered with Disney in its theme park attraction The American Idol Experience.\nAmerican Idol became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting the fourth season,[325] and by the next season, it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series, selling over $700,000 for a 30-seconds slot,[326] and reaching up to $1.3 million for the finale.[327] Its ad prices reached a peak in the seventh season at $737,000.[321] Estimated revenue more than doubled from $404 million in the third season to $870 million in the sixth season.[328] While that declined from the eighth season onwards, it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor,[329][330] with advertising revenue topping $800 million annually the next few seasons.[331] However, the sharp drop in ratings in the eleventh season also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for the twelfth season, and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers.[332] By 2014, ad revenue from had fallen to $427 million where a 30-second spot went for less than $300,000.[333] For the relaunched Idol on ABC, it has been reported that a 30-second spot may cost between $120,000\u2013$160,000.[334]\nFord Motor Company and Coca-Cola were two of the first sponsors of American Idol in its first season. The sponsorship deal cost around $10 million in the first season,[335] rising to $35 million by the seventh season,[324] and between $50 to $60 million in the tenth season.[336] The third major sponsor AT&T Wireless joined in the second season but ended after the twelfth season, and Coca-Cola officially ended its sponsorship after the thirteenth season amidst the declining ratings of Idol in the mid-2010s. iTunes sponsored the show since the seventh season.\nAmerican Idol prominent display of its sponsors' logo and products had been noted since the early seasons.[12][240] By the sixth season, Idol showed 4,349 product placements according to Nielsen Media Research.[337] The branded entertainment integration proved beneficial to its advertisers \u2013 promotion of AT&T text-messaging as a means to vote successfully introduced the technology into the wider culture,[56][338] and Coca-Cola has seen its equity increased during the show.[339]\nCoca-Cola \u2013 Cups bearing logo of Coca-Cola, and occasionally its subsidiary Vitaminwater,[340] are featured prominently on the judges table. Contestants are shown between songs held in the \"Coca-Cola Red Room\", the show's equivalent of the green room. (The Coca-Cola logo however is obscured during rebroadcast in the UK which until 2011 banned product placement.[341])\nFord \u2013 Contestants appear in the special Ford videos on the results shows, and winners Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Hicks, and Kris Allen have also appeared in commercials for Ford.[323] The final two each won a free Ford Mustang in the fourth through sixth seasons, Ford Escape Hybrid in the seventh season, Ford Fusion Hybrid in the eighth season, Ford Fiesta in the ninth season, and 2013 Ford Fusion in the eleventh season. In the tenth season Scotty McCreery chose a Ford F-150 and Lauren Alaina chose Shelby Mustang. In the red room, there is a glass table with a Ford wheel as its base.\nAT&T \u2013 AT&T Mobility is promoted as the service provider for text-voting. AT&T created an ad campaign that centered on an air-headed teenager going around telling people to vote.\nPrevious sponsors include Old Navy and Clairol's Herbal Essences. In the second and third seasons, contestants sometimes donned Old Navy clothing for their performances with celebrity stylist Steven Cojocaru assisting with their wardrobe selection,[342] and contestants received Clairol-guided hair makeovers. In the seventh-season finale, both David Cook and David Archuleta appeared in \"Risky Business\"-inspired commercials for Guitar Hero, a sponsor of the tour that year.\nCoca-Cola's archrival PepsiCo declined to sponsor American Idol at the show's start. What the Los Angeles Times later called \"missing one of the biggest marketing opportunities in a generation\" contributed to Pepsi losing market share, by 2010 falling to third place from second in the United States. PepsiCo sponsored the American version of Cowell's The X Factor in hopes of not repeating its Idol mistake until its cancellation.[343]\nThe top ten (eleven in the tenth season, five in the fourteenth season, and seven in the sixteenth season) toured at the end of every season except for the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons.[345][346] In the twelfth season tour a semi-finalist who won a sing-off was also added to the tour. Kellogg's Pop-Tarts was the sponsor for the first seven seasons, and Guitar Hero was added for the seventh season tour. M&M's Pretzel Chocolate Candies was a sponsor of the ninth season tour. The fifth season tour was the most successful tour with gross of over $35 million.[347] However no concert tour was organized in the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons, the only seasons not to have an associated tour.[348] The sixteenth season tour featured the band In Real Life as an opener on select dates.[349]\nIdol Gives Back was a special charity event started in season six featuring performances by celebrities and various fund-raising initiatives. This event was also held in seasons seven and nine and has raised nearly $185 million in total.[95]\nAmerican Idol has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants' performances as well as the winner's coronation single for sale. For the first five seasons, the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season. All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made then American Idol the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program.[350] Starting late in the fifth season, individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads, initially from the American Idol official website only. In the seventh season the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor. In the tenth season the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night.\nOn February 14, 2009, The Walt Disney Company debuted \"The American Idol Experience\" at its Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. In this live production, co-produced by 19 Entertainment, park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the Idol set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real Idol judges, critiqued the performances.[352] Audience members then voted for their favorite performer. There were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a \"finals\" show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner.[353] The winner of the finals show received a \"Dream Ticket\" that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future American Idol audition.[352] The attraction closed on August 30, 2014.[354]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(May 2021)\nAmerican Idol is broadcast to over 100 nations worldwide.[355] In most nations these are not live broadcasts and may be tape delayed by several days or weeks, except for other season finales that are aired live in several countries simulcast with the U.S. broadcast on Fox (2002\u20132016) and ABC (since 2018). In Canada, the first thirteen seasons of American Idol were aired live countrywide by CTV and/or CTV Two, in simulcast with Fox. CTV dropped Idol after its thirteenth season and in August 2014, Yes TV announced that it had picked up Canadian rights to American Idol beginning in its 2015 season.[356][357] In 2017, it was announced the show would return to CTV Two for its sixteenth season.[358] Since season nineteen, the show started airing on Citytv.\nIn Latin America, the show is broadcast and subtitled by Sony Entertainment Television. In Southeast Asia, it is broadcast by Sony Channel every Monday and Tuesday nine or ten hours after since its revival. In Philippines, it is aired every Thursday and Friday nine or ten hours after its United States telecast; from 2004 to 2007 on ABC 5; 2008\u201311 on QTV, then GMA News TV; and 2012\u201316, 2018\u201319 on ETC. In Indonesia, it was aired on RCTI in the 2002 to 2003 season with the Indonesian subtitles, before the Indonesian version of Idols was held in the 2004, aired after each episode ended, and in the 2011 to 2013 season it was broadcast by B-Channel (now RTV). In Australia, it aired a few hours after the U.S. telecast. It was aired on Network Ten from 2002 to 2008 and then again in 2013. Between 2008 and 2012 it aired on Fox8 and the thirteenth and fourteenth seasons (2014\u201315) it aired on digital channel, Eleven, a sister channel to Network Ten. Its final season (2016) aired on Fox8 hours after the original U.S. broadcast. The show enjoyed a lot of popularity in Australia throughout the 2000s before declining in the ratings.[359] In the United Kingdom, episodes were aired one day after the U.S. broadcast on digital channel ITV2. In the twelfth season, the episodes aired on 5*. It was also aired in Ireland on TV3 two days after the telecast. In Brazil and Israel, the show airs two days after its original broadcast, and broadcast live during the season finale. In the instances where the airing is delayed, the shows may sometimes be combined into one episode to summarize the results. In Italy, the twelfth season was broadcast by La3.[360] In Singapore, The show was broadcast on Mediacorp Channel 5 for the ninth and tenth seasons.\n^American Idol does not have a ranking for the 2001\u20132002 season because it aired in the summer of 2002. If it had aired within the official 2001\u20132002 U.S. television season, the Wednesday results show would have ranked number 25 and the Tuesday performance show would have ranked number 30, assuming it would have had the same rating as it did in the summer.",

        "context": "\nThe festival's origins trace back to a 1993 concert that Pearl Jam performed at the Empire Polo Club while boycotting venues controlled by Ticketmaster. The show validated the site's viability for hosting large events, leading to the inaugural Coachella Festival being held over the course of two days in October 1999, three months after Woodstock '99. After no event was held in 2000, Coachella returned on an annual basis beginning in April 2001 as a single-day event. In 2002, the festival reverted to a two-day format. Coachella was expanded to a third day in 2007 and eventually a second weekend in 2012; it is now held on consecutive three-day weekends in April, with the same lineup each weekend. Organizers began permitting spectators to camp on the grounds in 2003, one of several expansions and additions in the festival's history. The festival was not held in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[3]\nCoachella showcases popular and established musical artists as well as emerging artists and reunited groups. It is one of the largest, most famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and the world.[4][5] Each Coachella staged from 2013 to 2015 set new records for festival attendance and gross revenues. The 2017 festival was attended by 250,000 people and grossed $114.6 million. Coachella's success led to Goldenvoice establishing additional music festivals at the site, including the annual Stagecoachcountry music festival beginning in 2007, the Big 4 thrash metal festival in 2011, and the classic rock-oriented Desert Trip in 2016.\nEven before we looked at [Empire Polo Club], it hit us. We wanted it to be far. So you surrender. So you can't leave your house and see a couple bands and be back home that night. We want you to go out there, get tired, and curse the show by Sunday afternoon. That sunset, and that whole feeling of Coachella hits you.\nOn November 5, 1993, Pearl Jam performed for almost 25,000 fans at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.[7] The site was selected because the band refused to play in Los Angeles as a result of a dispute with Ticketmaster over service charges applied to ticket purchases.[8][9] The show established the polo club's suitability for large-scale events; Paul Tollett, whose concert promotion company Goldenvoice booked the venue for Pearl Jam, said the concert sowed the seeds for an eventual music festival there.[6]\nAround 1997, Goldenvoice was struggling to book concerts against larger companies, and they were unable to offer guarantees as high as their competitors, such as SFX Entertainment. Tollett said, \"We were getting our ass kicked financially. We were losing a lot of bands. And we couldn't compete with the money.\"[10] As a result, the idea of a music festival was conceived, and Tollett began to brainstorm ideas for one with multiple venues. His intent was to book trendy artists who were not necessarily chart successes: \"Maybe if you put a bunch of them together, that might be a magnet for a lot of people.\"[8] While attending the 1997 Glastonbury Festival, Tollett handed out pamphlets to artists and talent managers that featured pictures of the Empire Polo Club and pitched a possible festival there. In contrast to the frequently muddy conditions at Glastonbury caused by rain, he recalled, \"We had this pamphlet... showing sunny Coachella. Everyone was laughing.\"[9]\nAfter scouting several sites for their festival,[6] Tollett and Goldenvoice co-president Rick Van Santen returned to the Empire Polo Club during the Big Gig festival in 1998. Impressed by the location's suitability for a festival, they decided to book their event there.[8] The promoters had hoped to stage their inaugural festival in 1998 but were unable to until the following year.[9] On July 16, 1999, Goldenvoice announced that the Indio City Council had approved the festival and would provide $90,000 for services such as traffic control and public safety. The funds came with a guarantee of repayment from the promoter, as the city was keen to avoid incurring another loss; the previous year's Big Gig festival cost Indio $16,000 due to last-minute changes to the lineup and poor attendance.[11] The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was officially announced on July 28 with a preliminary lineup of 40 acts;[12] tickets went on sale on August 7.[13]\nCoachella's announcement came just one week after the conclusion of Woodstock '99, a festival in July 1999 that was marred by looting, arson, violence, and rapes. Goldenvoice's insurance costs increased 40% as a result and the company faced uncertainty regarding Coachella's tickets.[9][14] Organizers were already aiming to provide a \"high-comfort festival experience\" for Coachella but rededicated themselves to those efforts after Woodstock '99. Advertisements boasted free water fountains, ample restrooms, and misting tents.[14] Retrospectively, Tollett called the decision to announce a new festival just two months prior to staging it \"financial suicide\".[9]\nOn October 9\u201310, 1999, the inaugural Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was held. Headlining the event were Beck, Tool, and Rage Against the Machine; other acts included the Chemical Brothers, Morrissey, A Perfect Circle, Jurassic 5 and Underworld. Originally, promoters had hoped to make the event three days (Friday to Sunday) and even considered the UK group Massive Attack as the third-day headliner.[15] The organizers strove to recreate European music festivals with small crowds in a great setting with plenty of turntables.[16] By booking acts based on artistry rather than radio popularity, Coachella earned the title of \"the anti-Woodstock\".[17]\nTickets sold for $50 for each day; about 17,000 tickets sold for the first day, and 20,000 for the second,[16] falling short of the overall attendance goal of 70,000.[18] Attendees were offered free parking and a free bottle of water upon entrance.[16] The event went smoothly, with the well-behaved crowd starkly contrasting with the violence that plagued Woodstock '99; the biggest challenges to Coachella concertgoers were temperatures exceeding 100 \u00b0F and the decisions of which of the 80-plus acts to attend.[17][18][19] The festival was well regarded among attendees and critics; Pollstar named it festival of the year, and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said that it \"laid the foundation for what someday may be a legacy of its own\".[20][21] However, Goldenvoice lost $850,000 on the undertaking,[22] forcing the promoter, in Tollett's words, to \"struggle for almost two years to survive as a company\".[23] Prominent acts, including the headliners, agreed to receive deferred compensation.[24]\nGoldenvoice reserved tentative dates for October 2000 to reprise the festival,[25] but ultimately canceled for that year; Tollett blamed it on the oversaturation of music festivals in Southern California.[20] Instead, Goldenvoice partnered with promoter Pasquale Rotella to stage the electronic dance music festival Nocturnal Wonderland at the Empire Polo Club in September 2000.[26][27]\nGoldenvoice opted to bring Coachella back in April 2001 in an attempt to beat the heat.[20][28] Ticket prices were raised to $65.[29] Organizers encountered difficulty booking acts for the festival and due to \"available talent\", were forced to shorten the festival to a single day.[30] Issues with securing a headliner threatened to doom the event until Perry Farrell agreed to bring his reunited group Jane's Addiction to the proceedings.[31] Amidst financial concerns, Tollett agreed to sell Goldenvoice to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) in March 2001 for $7 million.[32] AEG, which had opened Staples Center in Los Angeles two years prior, purchased the promoter to help them find shows to book. The corporation wanted Tollett to continue staging Coachella, understanding that it initially would lose money;[9] Tollett initially retained full control of Coachella as a result of the acquisition.[31][33] Like its predecessor, the 2001 festival went smoothly;[23] 32,000 people attended,[26] and despite taking a loss again, Tollett estimates it was a \"low, low six-figure sum\".[23]\nFor its third outing, Coachella reverted to a two-day format and took place from April 27\u201328, 2002. Tollett said that the event was expanded to a second day after more acts began expressing interest in participating.[34] With around 60 artists performing,[35] the festival featured headliners Bj\u00f6rk and Oasis, along with a reunion of Siouxsie and the Banshees.[36] Palm Desert natives Queens of the Stone Age became the first local band to play the festival.[22] Multiple changes were made for that year: one less tent was used,[37] reducing the number of stages from five to four,[34] and a fence in the middle of the polo field was removed to increase the openness of the site.[37] The strong supporting acts helped prove to the Indio community that the event could bring in money and take place without conflict. More than 55,000 people attended over the two days,[22] and for the first time, the festival nearly broke even.[23]\nThe 2003 festival took place from April 26\u201327.[10] Among the 82 acts booked by Goldenvoice were headliners Red Hot Chili Peppers and Beastie Boys, as well as a reunited Iggy Pop and the Stooges. Performances were held on two outdoor stages and in three tents.[38] Ticket prices remained $75 per day, but were increased to $140 for a two-day pass.[10] For the first time, on-site camping was offered;[39] the Indio City Council approved overnight camping at the site, permitting up to four people on each of the 2,252 camping spots.[40] The festival drew 60,000 people, the largest Coachella crowd to that point.[41] The festival began to develop worldwide interest and receive national renown.\nIn late December 2003, Van Santen died at the age of 41 from flu-related complications.[2] With Tollett left, he sold half of Coachella to AEG in 2004, along with the controlling interest in the festival.[9] The 2004 event featured a lineup of more than 80 acts,[42] with Radiohead and the Cure as headliners, along with a reunion of the Pixies. It was Coachella's first sellout, drawing a two-day total of 110,000 people. For the first time, the festival attracted attendees from all 50 US states.[22] The event was critically acclaimed; Hilburn called it \"the premier pop music festival in the country\", while Rolling Stone labeled it \"America's Best Music Festival\". Tollett said that 2004 was the turning point for Coachella, and he credited booking Radiohead with elevating the festival's stature and interest among musicians. However, he also described that year's event as a missed opportunity, as he passed on a chance to expand it to a third day that could have featured David Bowie as a headliner.[42]\nThe 2005 event ran from April 30 to May 1 and featured Coldplay and Nine Inch Nails as headliners, along with a reunion of Bauhaus. A planned reunion of Cocteau Twins was ultimately cancelled by the group.[43] Approximately 50,000 people attended each day of the festival.[44]\nDaft Punk's performance at Coachella 2006 is frequently cited as one of the most memorable in the festival's history.\nThe 2006 event featured headliners Depeche Mode and Tool. Two of the most popular performances were Madonna, who played in an overflowing dance tent, and Daft Punk, whose show featuring a pyramid-shaped stage is cited as one of the most memorable performances in Coachella history.[22] Around 120,000 concertgoers attended the event over two days,[22] garnering Goldenvoice a gross of $9 million.[45]\nIn 2007, Goldenvoice inaugurated the Stagecoach Festival, an annual country music festival that also takes place at the Empire Polo Club the weekend following Coachella. The new event helped avert complications with organizing Coachella; the polo club's owner Alex Haagen III had been planning to redevelop the land unless a new profitable event could be created to make a long-term lease with Goldenvoice financially feasible.[8] Along with the new festival's addition, Coachella was permanently extended to three days in 2007. The headlining acts were Red Hot Chili Peppers, the reunited Rage Against the Machine, and Bj\u00f6rk, all of whom headlined for the second time. The festival compiled a three-day aggregate attendance of over 186,000, a new best, and grossed $16.3 million.[46]\nIn 2008, Coachella did not sell out for the first time since 2003. It featured headliners Prince, Roger Waters, and Jack Johnson. Waters' inflatable prop pig flew away during his set.[22] The 2008 festival drew an attendance of 151,666 and grossed $13.8 million,[46] but lost money, due to tickets not selling out and high booking fees paid for Prince and Roger Waters.[8][24]\nThe 2009 festival occurred a week earlier than usual. The new dates were April 17, 18 and 19. The event featured headliners Paul McCartney, The Killers, and The Cure. On Friday, McCartney blew past the festival's strict curfew by 54 minutes.[22] Sunday, The Cure had their performance end abruptly, with the festival cutting stage power after passing their own curfew by 30 minutes.[47] Notable performances included Franz Ferdinand, M.I.A. (whose 2005 encore set in a tent was a first at the fest), Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and rare appearances from artists Leonard Cohen, Dr. Dog and Throbbing Gristle. The festival drew an aggregate attendance of 152,962 and grossed $15,328,863.[48]\nOrganizers eliminated single-day ticket sales for 2010, and instead instituted a new policy offering three-day tickets only,[49] which drew mixed reactions.[50] Headliners included Jay-Z, Muse and Gorillaz, and reunions of Faith No More and Pavement.[51] Despite Tollett's reservations about holding a festival in 2010 due to the economy,[52] Coachella drew 75,000 spectators each day that year, for an estimated aggregate attendance of 225,000, surpassing previous records.[53] Thousands of fans broke through fences, leading to concerns about overcrowding.[22] The festival grossed $21,703,500.[54] International travel was disrupted by the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland, resulting in some European acts, such as Frightened Rabbit, Gary Numan and Delphic, canceling their appearances at the festival.[55]\nPrior to the 2011 festival, Goldenvoice made several investments and improvements locally to help support Coachella. In addition to funding an additional lane for Avenue 50, which borders the festival, the promoter cleared additional space on the polo grounds by leveling a 250,000-square-foot area and moving horse stables.[56] Lighting and security were also enhanced to help the festival run more smoothly.[22] The headliners for that year's event were Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Kanye West, and The Strokes, along with another 190 supporting acts.[57] The 2011 festival grossed $24,993,698[58] from 75,000 paid attendees, for an aggregate attendance of 225,000 across the entire three-day weekend.[59]\nOn May 31, 2011, Goldenvoice announced that beginning with the 2012 festival, Coachella would be expanded to a second, separately-ticketed weekend, with identical lineups for each.[60] Explaining the decision, Tollett said that demand for tickets was up in 2011 even after \"operations weren't the best [they've] ever had\" in 2010 and that he did not want to satisfy that demand by allowing additional attendees to overcrowd the venue.[61]Rolling Stone called it a \"very risky move\" and said there was \"no guarantee that demand [would be] high enough to sell out the same bill over two consecutive weekends\".[60] Nonetheless, 2012 tickets sold out in less than three hours.[62]\nThe 2012 festival during sunset\nThe 2012 festival featured headliners the Black Keys, Radiohead, and a twin billing of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.[22] During the latter's performances, a projection of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur appeared on-stage [63][64] (a voice actor performed his introduction lines) and began performing \"Hail Mary\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\".[65] Although the media referred to the technology as a \"hologram\", the projection was in fact created using the Musion Eyeliner system, which employs a version of Pepper's ghost.[66][67] Following the performance, the projection disappeared. Dr. Dre had asked permission from Shakur's mother Afeni, who said the next day that she was thrilled with the performance.[68] A projection of deceased singer Nate Dogg was also planned, but Dr. Dre decided against it. The 2012 festival grossed $47,313,403 from 158,387 paid attendees across the two weekends; 80,726 tickets were sold for the first weekend, and 77,661 for the second.[69]\nCoachella grounds in 2013\nPrior to the 2013 festival, it was announced that Goldenvoice had reached a deal with the city of Indio to keep the Coachella and Stagecoach Festivals there through 2030. As part of the agreement, Indio's per-ticket share of revenue would increase from $2.33 per ticket to $5.01.[70] Headlining the 2013 festival were Blur, The Stone Roses, Phoenix, and Red Hot Chili Peppers.[71] General admission tickets sold for $349, a $34 increase from the previous year.[72] The festival grossed $67.2 million in ticket sales and was attended by 180,000 people, making it the top music festival in the world.[73] In July 2013, Goldenvoice finalized a $30 million purchase of 280 acres of land surrounding the Empire Polo Club, including the 200-acre Eldorado Polo Club. The land, previously leased from Eldorado, will be used to provide more space for parking and general use for the festival.[74] Tollett said the purchase was intended to \"help [Goldenvoice] put in some infrastructure so [they] don't have to keep coming back and do the same things each year\".[75]\nThe 2014 festival, held on April 11\u201313 and April 18\u201320, featured 184 artists.[76] A reunited Outkast headlined on Friday, Muse on Saturday, and Arcade Fire on Sunday.[77] General admission tickets sold out in less than 20 minutes, while all other tickets (including VIP tickets in excess of $5,000) sold out in less than 3 hours.[citation needed] That year's festival featured 96,500 daily attendees and grossed a record-breaking $78.332 million.[78][79] For the fourth consecutive year, Coachella was named the Top Festival at the Billboard Touring Awards.[79]\nA view of the ferris wheel from the polo grounds during Coachella 2015\nThe 2015 festival, held on April 10\u201312 and 17\u201319,[80] featured headliners AC/DC, Jack White, and Drake, with a surprise appearance by Madonna during the latter's weekend one performance. General admission tickets again sold out in less than 20 minutes.[citation needed] The event established new records for tickets sold (198,000) and total gross ($84,264,264) for a festival.[79] The festival won Pollstar's award for Major Music Festival of the Year,[81] marking the 10th time in 11 years that Coachella had won the award.[82]\nIn March 2016, the Indio City Council passed a measure to raise the attendance cap for Coachella from 99,000 to 125,000, stipulating that the capacity would gradually be increased, giving the city time to accommodate the crowds. Goldenvoice increased the venue size by about 50 acres along Monroe Street, Avenue 50, Avenue 52, and Polo Road.[83] The 2016 festival was held on April 15\u201317 and 22\u201324, and was headlined by a reunited LCD Soundsystem, a reunited Guns N' Roses (with original members Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff McKagan), and Calvin Harris. Ice Cube's appearance featured a reunion of N.W.A., while Guns N' Roses' first weekend performance featured a guest appearance from Angus Young of AC/DC, who headlined the previous year; the cameo occurred the same day that Rose was announced as the new singer for AC/DC. Weekend two was marked by several tributes to Prince, the 2008 headliner who died just prior to the weekend's shows. The festival sold 198,000 tickets and grossed $94.2 million.[84][85]\nIn January 2017, reports circulated that AEG owner Philip Anschutz had donated to many right-wing causes, including organizations promoting LGBTQ discrimination and climate change denial.[86] The news led to calls for fans to boycott the festival.[87] Anschutz decried the controversy as \"fake news\", saying he would never knowingly contribute to an anti-LGBTQ organization and would cease donations to any such group of which he became aware.[88]\nThe 2017 edition of Coachella took place from April 14\u201316 and April 21\u201323, and featured Radiohead, Lady Gaga, and Kendrick Lamar as headlining artists.[89] Beyonc\u00e9 was originally announced as a headliner but was forced to withdraw at the advice of her doctors after she became pregnant; she announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival.[90][91] Tickets sold out within a few hours of going on sale.[92] The event saw the debut of the new daytime-only Sonora tent.[93] The 2017 festival drew 250,000 attendees and grossed $114.6 million,[94] marking the first time a recurring festival grossed over $100 million.[95] Between the two weekends of Coachella, scenes for the film A Star Is Born, starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, were filmed on the festival grounds.[96]\nA report in Teen Vogue described \"rampant\" sexual harassment and assault at the 2018 festival, and the author said she was groped 22 times in 10 hours.[108] In response, Goldenvoice announced a new initiative in January 2019 called \"Every One\", which comprises \"fan resources and policies\" to combat sexual misconduct and improve the festival's responses to such behavior. \"Safety ambassadors\" were made available to direct attendees to professional counselors, and specially marked locations were added for attendees to seek services or report incidents of sexual misconduct. One of the program's goals stated, \"We are taking deliberate steps to develop a festival culture that is safe and inclusive for everyone\".[109]\nCoachella celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2019. Taking place from April 12\u201314 and 19\u201321, the festival was headlined by Childish Gambino, Tame Impala, and Ariana Grande.[110][111] At 25 years old, Grande became the youngest artist to headline the festival and just its fourth female headliner.[112] The festival was beset with several challenges. Justin Timberlake was reportedly slated to headline but had to cancel after bruising his vocal cords.[113] Goldenvoice was also forced to abandon plans for Kanye West to headline, as they could not accommodate his request to build a giant dome for his performance in the middle of the festival grounds. West was instead allowed to hold the first public \"Sunday Service\" performance on Easter on April 21 at the venue's campgrounds.[114] West and a gospel choir performed an approximately 33-song set list of his songs as well as classic R&B and gospel covers.[115] The first weekend of the festival suffered audio technical difficulties with several high-profile performances.[116] The following weekend, The Daily Beast published a report of the alleged \"inhumane treatment\" of the festival's security guards. The workers cited poor tent conditions, insufficient food and water, long hours in the harsh sun, minimum wages, and poor communication and coordination between the organizers and the subcontracting security firms.[117]\nCoachella returned in 2022 on April 15\u201317 and April 22\u201324.[123] The headlining lineup initially comprised Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, Kanye West, and Swedish House Mafia.[124] Less than two weeks before the festival, West withdrew. The vacancy in the Sunday night headliner slot was filled by Swedish House Mafia \u2013 who previously had not been scheduled for a specific day \u2013 for a joint performance with the Weeknd.[125] While not advertised as a headlining act, Arcade Fire was added to the official 2022 schedule on April 14, a day before the festival's first weekend.[126]\nThe 2023 edition of Coachella, which took place from April 14\u201316 and April 21\u201323, was also beset with last-minute lineup changes. The originally announced headliners were Bad Bunny, Blackpink, and Frank Ocean; the former two were Coachella's first Latin and Korean headliners, respectively.[127] In the days leading up to the first weekend, Ocean suffered leg injuries from an alleged bicycle accident on the festival grounds. The production for his performance was then scaled down extensively;[128] plans to utilize an ice rink with over 100 skaters were scrapped at the last minute,[129] forcing festival crew to hurriedly melt the ice surface.[130] Ocean began his performance an hour late, and after exceeding the festival curfew by 25 minutes, he abruptly ended his show.[131] He subsequently withdrew from the second weekend, citing recommendations from his doctor. Blink-182, which reunited its classic lineup and had been added to the festival two days before it began,[132] was promoted to fill the second weekend's headlining vacancy on Sunday night.[133] After they performed, the trio of DJs Skrillex, Four Tet, and Fred Again \u2013 all of whom were added to the lineup the day before the second weekend began \u2013 concluded the festival.[134] According to reports, Goldenvoice will incur more than $4 million in losses from the production costs associated with Ocean's unused ice rink, more than his booking fee for the performance. The promoters were also fined $133,000 for curfew violations from the opening weekend.[135]\nDuring the festival, several stages continuously host live music. Two outdoor stages are used, along with several tents named after deserts.[139] The primary stages that have been in use since Coachella's inception are:\nCoachella Stage \u2013 the main stage that draws the largest crowds. This outdoor stage is where the headlining acts perform.\nMojave \u2013 a mid-size tent[140] named after the Mojave Desert that hosts acts across multiple genres and varying stages of development.[139] In 2017, it was moved behind an access road. A year later, it received further changes, as it was enlarged and moved again, this time to the Sahara's previous spot near the rose garden.[140]\nGobi \u2013 a mid-size tent named after the Gobi Desert that hosts acts across multiple genres and varying stages of development.[139] Like the Mojave, it was moved behind an access road in 2017.[140]\nSahara \u2013 a large, hangar-like tent named after the Sahara Desert. It generally hosts the top electronic dance music acts.[139] In 2013, the tent was expanded in size, reaching a height of 80 feet. Further changes were made in 2018, as it was built 25 percent larger and relocated west from the row of tents near the Empire Polo Club's rose garden to a spot on the Eldorado Polo Club near the festival entrance. The new location offers more shade and alleviates issues with foot traffic.[140][141] The stage was also moved from one of the open ends of the structure to one its sides, allowing a wider field of view to attendees.[141]\nAdditional performance areas have been added over time, including:\nYuma \u2013 a small indoor tent introduced in 2013[142] that primarily hosts emerging DJs.[139] The tent was intended to be \"a sophisticated space that dials down the noise and strobe lights in favor of thoughtful sounds and underground acts\".[142]\nHeineken House \u2013 a small venue introduced in 2014. It was dedicated to \"legendary musical performances\" and \"live mash-ups from a wide array of musical artists\".[143] Originally designed as a walled structure to provide a club-like atmosphere, it was redesigned in 2019 to feature an open beer garden layout with a slanted roof, eliminating the long waiting lines and giving more visibility to attendees.[144]\nDespacio \u2013 a small indoor tent used in 2016. Co-created by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, the venue played \"slow-simmering disco and vintage club music\" on vinyl with the intention of creating a joyful setting. It featured a 50,000 watt sound system and air conditioning.[145][146]\nAntarctic \u2013 an indoor dome introduced in 2017 to screen 360-degree immersive videos. The structure is 120 feet in diameter, features 11,000 square feet in projection space and air conditioning, and can seat 500 people. Obscura Digital produced the film shown in 2017.[139][147]\nTwo art installations from Coachella 2014: Lightweaver and Escape Velocity. The latter piece was one of several giant moving art installations designed by Poetic Kinetics for past Coachella festivals.\nIn addition to hosting live music, Coachella is a showcase for visual arts, including installation art and sculpture. Many of the pieces are interactive, providing a visual treat for attendees.[148] Throughout the years, the art has grown in scale and outrageousness.[149] Paul Clemente, Coachella's art director since 2009,[150] said, \"I think the level of detail and finish and artistry and scale and complexity and technology, everything is constantly getting notched up, ratcheted up. We're obviously constantly trying to, for lack of a better word, (to) outdo ourselves and make it better for the fans.\"[149]\nIn Coachella's early years, art was mostly recycled from the previous year's Burning Man festival, due to smaller budgets.[150] Between 2010 and 2015, Goldenvoice shifted its focus from renting pieces to commissioning them specifically for the festival, increasing their budget. Artists are given access to the grounds just 10 days before the festival, giving them a tight timeframe in which to assemble their pieces.[149] Due to the high cost of re-assembly, only about half of them appear again outside of Coachella.[148] Describing the festival's importance to art, Cynthia Washburn of art collective Poetic Kinetics said, \"With all the exposure here, I think Coachella is becoming as attractive for artists as it is for the musicians.\"[151] In 2013, Clemente considered about 300 art proposals, the most in the festival's history for the time.[151] Poetic Kinetics has designed several giant moving art installations for past Coachella festivals, including a snail in 2013 (\"Helix Poeticus\"), an astronaut in 2014 (\"Escape Velocity\"), and a caterpillar that \"metamorphosized\" into a butterfly in 2015 (\"Papilio Merraculous\").[152] The collective reprised the astronaut for the 2019 festival (\"Overview Effect\"), with weathering affects applied to the design.[153]\nAs the host city to Coachella and the Stagecoach Festival, Indio provides several services such as police and fire protection, private security, medical services, outside law enforcement, and city staff services. These services for the three weekends of festivals totaled $2.77 million in 2012.[154] All public safety needs are coordinated by Indio's police department, requiring them to liaise with nearly 12 agencies, including police departments from nearby cities, the sheriff's department, California Highway Patrol, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, American Medical Response, and the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.[154] To avoid disturbing local residents, a curfew for music performances is enforced; since 2010, it has been 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, an hour later than the previous curfew,[154] and midnight on Sunday nights.[82] Per a 2013 agreement with the City of Indio, Goldenvoice must pay a fine of $20,000 if it exceeds the curfew by five minutes, plus $1,000 for each additional minute beyond that. The fines benefit the city's General Fund, which covers operating costs, public work services, and the police and fire departments.[155]\nCoachella features Global Inheritance's TRASHed :: Art of Recycling campaign, in which artists from across the US design recycling bins.\nOrganizers of Coachella manage its carbon footprint by partnering with the organization Global Inheritance to promote several environmentally friendly initiatives. Global Inheritance's original project was its \"TRASHed :: Art of Recycling\" campaign, which challenges local artists to design and decorate recycling bins that are placed across the festival grounds.[156] Another program is \"Carpoolchella\"; launched in 2007,[156] it rewards festivalgoers who carpool in groups of four or more and display the word \"Carpoolchella\" on their cars by entering them in a drawing to win VIP tickets for life.[157] Through the 2014 festival, the program had 140,000 participants and more than 70 winners of lifetime festival passes.[158] In 2007, Coachella teamed up with Global Inheritance to start a 10-for-1 recycling program, in which anyone who collects ten empty water bottles receives a free full one. In 2009, the festival introduced $10 refillable water bottles, which purchasers could refill at water stations inside the festival and within the campgrounds.[159] Other programs used at the festival include solar powered DJ booths and seesaws used to charge mobile phones.[156]\nAbout 600 staffers are required to collect the litter that accumulates during the festival. Resources are sorted individually on site before being taken to local landfills and recycling centers. Goldenvoice maintains a goal to \"divert 90 percent of [its] recyclable and compostable materials\". In 2013, staff diverted over 577,720,000 pounds of materials, comprising 36,860 tons of aluminum cans, 105,000 tons of cardboard, 65,360 tons of PET plastic, 47,040 tons of scrap metal, and 34,600 tons of glass.[160]\nIn 2003, Coachella began allowing tent camping as an option for festival lodging. The campground site is on a polo field adjacent to the venue grounds and has its own entrance on the south side of the venue. 2010 introduced many new features, such as re-entry from the campsite to the festival grounds, parking next to your tent, and recreational vehicle camping spots (recreational vehicle camping was offered one year only). For that festival, there were more than 17,000 campers. At the 2012 event, on-site facilities included recycling, a general store, showers, mobile phone charging stations and an internet cafe with free WiFi.[161]\nTollett begins to book artists for each festival as early as the previous August. In addition to agent pitches and artists discovered online, the lineup is culled from acts booked by Goldenvoice for their other 1,800 shows each year. Tollett uses the promoter's ticketing figures for insight into whom to book, saying: \"There are AEG shows all across the country, and I see all their show lists and ticket counts. So I see little things that are happening maybe before some others, because they don't have that data.\"[162] The booking process takes approximately six months.[9]\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, booking fees for most artists playing the festival allegedly start at $15,000 and extend into the \"high six figures.\" Top-billed artists for 2010 were expected to receive over $1 million.[163]Billboard's sources estimated that non-headline acts can earn anywhere from $500 to $100,000.[162] According to a 2017 profile on Tollett in The New Yorker, that year's headlining performers received $3\u20134 million.[9] Beyonc\u00e9's 2018 performances and Ariana Grande's 2019 performances reportedly garnered them each $8 million.[164]\nIn booking the festival, Goldenvoice uses radius clauses that can prevent acts from performing in the vicinity of Coachella for a certain amount of time before and after the festival. The promoter has allowed some of Coachella's acts to make appearances in the region prior to the festival and between weekends, but only at events and venues owned or controlled by Goldenvoice's parent company AEG; one such example was Jay-Z's concert at Staples Center in 2010.[163][165][166] Goldenvoice now promotes these events, dubbed \"Localchella\", as a series of small warm-up shows for Coachella in Southern California.[167][168] In May 2018, AEG and its subsidiaries were sued by the Oregon-based Soul'D Out Festival for anti-competitive practices related to Coachella's radius clause. As part of the lawsuit, the clause's details were revealed. They stipulate that any artist performing at Coachella:[169][170]\nCannot perform at any other North American festival from December 15 to May 1.\nCannot play any hard ticket shows in Southern California from December 15 to May 1.\nCannot \"advertise, publicize or leak\" performances for competing festivals in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, or Arizona, or headlining performances in Southern California taking place after May 1 until after May 7.\nCannot publicize concerts in California, Arizona, Washington, or Oregon until after the January announcement of Coachella's lineup, except for performances in Las Vegas casinos.\nGoldenvoice attempts to release the lineup poster as close to New Year's Day as possible, so that Coachella is the first major festival of the year to announce its lineup. This gives the promoter a competitive advantage over other festivals, many of which end up sharing headliners by the time they are all announced.[9] The Coachella lineup poster lists its music artists across several lines in gradually decreasing font sizes in descending order of prominence. The line on which an artist's name appears as well as their font size is a contentious topic between Goldenvoice and talent agents, as placement on the poster will often dictate an artist's future booking fee. Tollett said, \"We have so many arguments over font sizes. I literally have gone to the mat over one point size.\"[9]\nOrganizers were initially resistant to accepting sponsorship deals that would help Coachella turn a higher profit. In 2003, Tollett estimated that Goldenvoice could earn an additional $300,000 to $500,000 by adding a corporate sponsor to the festival name, but he did not want to violate the purity of the event. He said, \"I hate it when you go to shows and you are bombarded with all this advertising. It just shows a lack of respect for your audience and the music.\"[23] Organizers have relaxed their opposition over the years. Brewing company Heineken N.V. has maintained a sponsorship with Coachella since 2002, and is the \"official brew\" of the festival.[171] The company has sponsored a small performance venue at the festival called the \"Heineken House\" since 2014, where attendees can drink Heineken beers and keep their cases of Heineken refrigerated.[143] Clothing retailer H&M added a small sponsored tent on the festival grounds in 2015,[172] where attendees could purchase items from the company's Coachella-inspired clothing line called \"H&M Loves Coachella\".[173] Information technology company HP has sponsored the Antarctic dome since 2017,[147] in addition to hosting a promotional tent.[174] HP's promotions included allowing attendees to design and print bandanas and tote bags, capture light drawingGIFs, design kaleidoscopes, and interact with a motion-reactive wall.[147][174] Tollett still objects to having the primary stages and tents sponsored: \"I wouldn't let sponsors' logos on the stages. I feel like when the band is playing it should be you and the band, and it's a sacred moment.\"[9]\nSince 2011, YouTube has live streamed performances from Coachella.[175] Initially, the first weekend was streamed across three separate channels.[137][176] In 2014, AXS TV began broadcasting the second weekend on television;[177] over 20 hours of live performances from the 2015 festival were broadcast on AXS TV.[178] Performances from the 2015 festival were also broadcast live on Sirius XM satellite radio for the first time.[179] In 2019, YouTube expanded its content for the festival livestream, which included a stream of both weekends of the festival for the first time. Weekend one included a premiere of Donald Glover's film Guava Island, while weekend two featured Coachella Curated, programming hosted by radio personality Jason Bentley that took \"a deep dive into the festival experience\" by offering \"encore and live performances, artist commentary, mini-docs, animated adventures and more\".[180]Coachella Curated was reprised for the 2022 festival's second weekend.[181] In 2023, Coachella's streaming agreement with YouTube was renewed through 2026,[175] and for the first time, performances from all six stages were streamed, covering both weekends.[182]\nFor 2016, organizers partnered with Vantage.tv to offer virtual reality (VR) content for the festival. Ticket holders received a cardboard VR viewer inspired by Google Cardboard in their Coachella welcome package that could be used with the Coachella VR mobile app (which was released on Android, iOS, and Samsung Gear VR). Content included 360-degree panoramic photos of previous events, virtual tours of the 2016 festival site, interviews, and performances.[183] That same year, YouTube live streamed performances from weekend two in 360 degrees for viewing with VR headsets.[184]\nThe success of Coachella has led its organizers to partner with other American music festivals. In 2003, Goldenvoice agreed to work with the organizers of Field Day, a New York-based festival modeled after Coachella, to help promote and produce the event,[185] although the show was completely overhauled from its original vision.[186] In September 2014, Goldenvoice announced it had entered into a joint venture with Red Frog Events to help them promote and produce their Firefly Music Festival.[187] In January 2015, a similar agreement was reached with the organizers of the Hangout Music Festival.[188]\nGoldenvoice claimed it spent $700,000 in 2015 on \"media and related content to promote Coachella\".[189]\nGoldenvoice has actively protected the Coachella brand. As of April 2018, they filed six lawsuits in the previous two years against outlets that attempted to use the Coachella name or the suffix \"chella\". The defendants included the music festival Hoodchella; the film festival Filmchella; energy company Phillips 66, which promoted a Coachella wristband giveaway that the festival's terms of services disallows; Sean Combs's event \"Combschella\"; Urban Outfitters; and a Whole Foods location in Palm Desert that promoted a \"Wholechella\" concert and tasting event. Another lawsuit was filed in September 2021 against radio presenter RaaShaun Casey (also known as DJ Envy) for his hip hop and auto show \"Carchella\", which he agreed to rename to \"DJ Envy's Drive Your Dreams Car Show\".[190][191] According to Goldenvoice's attorneys in one lawsuit, the litigation is one way the promoter attempts to \"extensively police unauthorized use of the Coachella Marks\". Although the Coachella name has been in use by a town in the Coachella Valley since before the festival was founded, the festival's success has imbued the name with \"secondary meaning\", allowing Goldenvoice to trademark it.[170]\nIn December 2021, Coachella won a restraining order against Live Nation's Coachella Day One 22 festival. A judge ruled that Live Nation is likely infringing trademarks by selling tickets to the event nearby.[192]\nAccording to a 2015 ranking by online ticket retailer Viagogo, Coachella was the second-most in-demand concert ticket, trailing only the Tomorrowland festival.[193]\nCoachella is considered a trendsetter in music and fashion. Singer Katy Perry said, \"The lineup always introduces the best of the year for the rest of the year.\"[162]\nCoachella has become known for the variety of distinctive apparel worn by attendees, which primarily include eclectic combinations of colors, materials, and ethnic borrowings.[194] The latter has also resulted in backlash regarding cultural appropriation, particularly for non-natives wearing Native American-inspired headdresses and body paint.[195][196][197]\nAccording to a 2012 economic impact study, Coachella brought $254.4 million to the desert region that year;[198] of that total, Indio received $89.2 million in consumer spending and $1.4 million in tax revenue.[193] Goldenvoice's other festival at the Empire Polo Club, Stagecoach, has been called a \"cousin\" of Coachella, but it has grown at a faster pace, eventually selling out for the first time in 2012 with 55,000 attendees.[199] Together, the two festivals were estimated by experts to have a global impact of $704.75 million in 2016;[200] approximately $403.2 million of that was expected to impact the Coachella Valley,[200] $106 million of which would go to businesses in Indio.[201] The city was expected to gain $3.18 million in ticket taxes from the two festivals in 2016.[201]\nThe success of Coachella led to Goldenvoice holding additional music festivals at the Empire Polo Club. It founded the country music festival Stagecoach in 2007 and continues to hold it on an annual basis. In 2011, the promoter staged the Big 4 festival, so-named for its quadruple billing of the most prominent bands in thrash metal\u2014Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer.[202] In 2016, Goldenvoice staged Desert Trip, which featured older rock oriented and legacy acts such as the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, and Bob Dylan.[203]\n^No award ceremony was held in 2017.

        "question": "When is this year's Black Friday?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)#:~:text=2023%C2%A0date,November%2024",
        "context": "\nBlack Friday is a colloquial term for the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States. It traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season in the United States. Many stores\noffer highly promoted sales at discounted prices and often open early, sometimes as early as midnight[2] or even on Thanksgiving. Some stores' sales continue to Monday (\"Cyber Monday\") or for a week (\"Cyber Week\").\nBlack Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States.[3][4][5]\nFor centuries, the adjective \"black\" has been applied to days upon which calamities occurred. Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American history was the Panic of 1869, which occurred when financiers Jay Gould and James Fisk took advantage of their connections with the Grant Administration in an attempt to corner the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by 18%. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, was ruined.\nThe earliest known use of \"Black Friday\" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, Factory Management and Maintenance, for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day week-end. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms \"Black Friday\" and \"Black Saturday\" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and Rochester to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days \"Big Friday\" and \"Big Saturday,\u201d but these terms were quickly forgotten.[6][7][8][9][10][11]\nThe use of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in The New York Times on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to \"the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year\" in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.[12]\nAs the phrase gained national attention in the early 1980s, merchants objecting to the use of a derisive term to refer to one of the most important shopping days of the year suggested an alternative derivation: that retailers traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season, beginning on the day after Thanksgiving.[6] When this was recorded in the financial records, once-common accounting practices would use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink to show positive amounts. Black Friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer be \"in the red,\u201d instead of taking in the year's profits.[6][12][13] The earliest known published reference to this explanation occurs in The Philadelphia Inquirer for November 28, 1981.[14]\nSince the early 21st century, there have been attempts by U.S.-based retailers to introduce a retail \"Black Friday\" to other countries around the world. Retailers outside the US have attempted to promote the day to remain competitive with US-based online retailers.[15]\nIn more recent decades, global retailers have adopted the term and date to market their own holiday sales.[16]\nThe day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States Christmas shopping season since 1952. The practice may be linked with the idea of Santa Claus parades. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that \"Santa has arrived\" or \"Santa is just around the corner\" because Christmas is always the next major Christian holiday following Thanksgiving.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Santa or Thanksgiving parades were sponsored by department stores. These include the continuing Toronto Santa Claus Parade in Canada since 1905, originally sponsored by Eaton's, and Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade held in Manhattan, New York City since 1924, sponsored by Macy's. Department stores would use the parades to launch a big advertising push. Eventually, it became an unwritten rule that no store would try doing Christmas advertising before the parade was over. Therefore, the day after Thanksgiving became the day when the shopping season officially started.\nThanksgiving's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.[17] Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving on the traditional date.[17] Some started referring to the new date as Franksgiving.\nIn 2015, Amazon.com was the first to offer \"Black Friday in July\" deals on what they called \"Prime Day\", promising better deals than on Black Friday. Amazon repeated the practice in 2016 and 2017, and other companies began offering similar deals.[18]\nAnalyst Marshal Cohen of The NPD Group claimed in 2020 that Black Friday is declining in favor of online shopping,[19] and that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process. The pandemic also resulted in holiday deals being offered over a longer period of time, even as early as October.[20] Fewer people shopped in person on Black Friday 2020, and most business took place online. Market research company Numerator said sellers of clothing, tools and other items considered nonessential during lockdowns were not promoted as heavily because lower production meant less available to sell.[21]Adobe Analytics reported that online sales reached $9 billion in 2020, 22% more than the previous year. Foot traffic to stores fell 48% in 2020 from last year, according to RetailNext, while Sensormatic Solutions reported a 52% decrease.[22]\nFor many years, retailers pushed opening times on Black Friday earlier and earlier, eventually reaching midnight, before opening on the evening of Thanksgiving. In 2009, Kmart manager Freddy Moss opened at 7 P.M. on Thanksgiving in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families. Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8 P.M. or 9 P.M., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\". In subsequent years, other stores have followed this trend, opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving, or remaining open all day, beginning in the early morning hours.[23][24] Some retail and media sources have used the terms \"Gray Thursday\" or \"Brown Thursday\" instead.[25][26][27]\nThe 2014 \"Black Thursday\" sales were generally a failure, as overall sales for the holiday week-end fell 11% compared to the previous year despite heavy traffic at the stores on Thanksgiving night.[28] In response, a number of retailers decided to go back to closing on Thanksgiving for 2015, and Walmart, although its holding firm opening on the holiday and holding its sale, also pledged to offer the same deals online for those who wished to stay home.[29]\nRetailers have received pushback from some consumers over opening on Thanksgiving Day.[30] Shopper opposition to stores opening on Thursday includes the perceived over-commercialization of Thanksgiving, retail workers not being able to spend time with their loved ones on the holiday,[31] and Thursday doorbuster sales forcing consumers to sacrifice enjoying Thanksgiving evening with their families in order to avoid missing out on highly sought-after items which might not be available again prior to Christmas.\nMost retailers abandoned efforts to hold doorbuster sales on Thanksgiving in 2020; large crowds had been forbidden under most circumstances since March due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, major retailers such as Walmart and Target had already reduced their hours and dropped 24/7 operations in response to the pandemic, and several retailers known for opening on the holiday (particularly Kmart, which has typically been open regular hours) have rapidly declined.[32] According to Adobe Analytics, online shopping set a record on Thanksgiving 2020 with $5.1 billion in total spending, 21.5% higher than in 2019.[21] Most major retailers again closed on Thanksgiving in 2021, with Target stating that its decision would be permanent; the small minority of retail chains remaining open on the holiday that year were limited mainly to pharmacies, dollar stores and grocery stores, retail categories that traditionally do not hold doorbusters.[33]\nBlack Friday is not an official holiday in the United States, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for state government employees. It is sometimes observed in lieu of another federal holiday, such as Columbus Day. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off. Along with the following regular week-end, this makes Black Friday weekend a four-day weekend, which is said to increase the number of potential shoppers.\nBlack Friday is a shopping day for a combination of reasons. As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday week-end. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of \"doorbuster\" items to entice traffic.\nFor many years, it was common for retailers to open at 6a.m., but in the late 2000s many opened at 4a.m.\u20135a.m. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. In 2010, Toys 'R' Us began their Black Friday sales at 10p.m. on Thanksgiving and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of Crayola crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like Sears, Express, MK, Victoria's Secret, Zumiez, Tillys, American Eagle Outfitters, Nike, Jordan, Puma, A\u00e9ropostale, and Kmart, began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11p.m. Friday evening. Forever 21 went in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday, and running late sales until 2a.m. Saturday morning.[36][37] In 2011, when several retailers (including Target, Kohl's, Macy's, Best Buy, and Bealls)[2] opened at midnight for the first time.[38] In 2012, Walmart and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 8p.m. on Thanksgiving, prompting calls for a walkout among some workers.[39] In 2014, stores such as JCPenney, Best Buy, and Radio Shack opened at 6a.m. on Thanksgiving while stores such as Target, Walmart, Belk, and Sears opened at 7p.m. on Thanksgiving.[40][41] Three states \u2013 Rhode Island, Maine, and Massachusetts \u2013 prohibit large supermarkets, big box stores, and department stores from opening on Thanksgiving, in what has been referred to as a legacy of blue laws.[42][43] A bill to allow stores to open on Thanksgiving was the subject of a public hearing on July 8, 2017.[44]\nHistorically, it was common for Black Friday sales to extend throughout the following week-end. However, this practice has largely disappeared in recent years, perhaps because of an effort by retailers to create a greater sense of urgency.\nThe news media usually give heavy play to reports of Black Friday shopping and their implications for the commercial success of the Christmas shopping season, but the relationship between Black Friday sales and retail sales for the full holiday season is quite weak and may even be negative.[45]\nIn 2014, spending volume on Black Friday fell for the first time since the 2008 recession. 50.9 billion dollars was spent during the four-day Black Friday week-end, down 11% from the previous year. However, the U.S. economy was not in a recession. Christmas creep has been cited as a factor in the diminishing importance of Black Friday, as many retailers now spread out their promotions over the entire months of November and December rather than concentrate them on a single shopping day or week-end.[46]\nIn 2015, Neil Stern of McMillan Doolittle said, \"Black Friday is quickly losing its meaning on many fronts,\" because many stores opened on Thanksgiving, and a lot of sales started even earlier than that. Online shopping also made the day less important.[49] A Gallup poll in 2012 has shown that only 18% of American adults planned to shop during Black Friday.[50]\nIn 2020, an article in Ad Age magazine stated that \"an American capitalist tradition ... has been on the wane for years as online shopping rises in popularity\" but the COVID-19 pandemic, \"which has dramatically altered shopping patterns, has seemingly dealt a fatal blow.\"[51]\nBy 2021, spending during the holiday season was expected to continue to increase, but Black Friday was no longer a single day. It was instead an opportunity for retailers to offer deals during the season as online shopping continued to change consumer behavior. COVID-19 had increased the changes in buyer and retailer moves toward online transactions. Supply chain disruptions caused consumers to buy earlier when they could find items.[52]\nThe large population centers on Lake Ontario and the Lower Mainland in Canada have always attracted cross-border shopping into the United States, and as Black Friday became more popular in the U.S., Canadians often flocked over the border because of their lower prices and a stronger Canadian dollar. After 2001, many were traveling for the deals across the border. Starting in 2008 and 2009, due to the parity of the Canadian dollar compared with the American dollar, several major Canadian retailers ran Black Friday deals of their own to discourage shoppers from leaving Canada.[53][54]\nThe year 2012 saw the biggest Black Friday to date in Canada, as Canadian retailers embraced it in an attempt to keep shoppers from travelling across the border.[55]\nBefore the advent of Black Friday in Canada, the most comparable holiday was Boxing Day in terms of retailer impact and consumerism. Black Fridays in the U.S. seem to provide deeper or more extreme price cuts than Canadian retailers, even for the same international retailer.\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"Black Friday\" originated within the Police and NHS to refer to the Friday before Christmas. It is the day when emergency services activate contingency plans to cope with the increase in workload due to many people going out drinking on the last Friday before Christmas. Contingencies can include setting up mobile field hospitals near City Centre nightspots.[56] The term has then been adopted outside those services to refer to the evening and night of the Friday immediately before Christmas, and would now be considered a mainstream term and not simply as jargon of the emergency services.\nTraditionally, Boxing Day had been considered the biggest shopping day of the year in the UK. In the 2010s, several American-owned retailers such as Amazon UK and the Walmart-owned chain Asda, began to hold U.S.-style Black Friday promotions; in 2014, more British retailers began to adopt the concept, including Argos, John Lewis, and Very. That year, police forces were called to shops across Britain to deal with crowd control issues, assaults, threatening customers, and traffic issues.[57][58] In response to incidents at branches of Tesco, Greater Manchester Police's deputy chief constable Ian Hopkins said shoppers had behaved in an \"appalling\" fashion, and criticized shops for not making adequate security arrangements to ensure the safety of customers.\"[59] Following these incidents, some retailers began to discontinue or heavily modify their promotions, with Asda stating that it would not hold all of its sales across a single day.[60][61][62]\nIn 2016, total spending on online retail sites on Black Friday was \u00a31.23 billion, a 2.2% year-over-year increase over 2015.[63][64] In 2017, UK retail sales in November grew faster than in December for the first time.[65][66]\nIn Mexico, Black Friday was the inspiration for the government and retailing industry to create an annual week-end of discounts and extended credit terms, El Buen Fin, meaning \"the good weekend\" in Spanish.[68] El Buen Fin has been in existence since 2011 and takes place on November in the week-end prior to the Monday in which the Mexican Revolution holiday is pushed from its original date of November 20, as a result of the measure taken by the government of pushing certain holidays to the Monday of their week in order to avoid the workers and students to make a \"larger\" week-end (for example, not attending in a Friday after a Thursday holiday, thus making a four-day week-end). On this week-end, major retailers extend their store hours[69] and offer special promotions, including extended credit terms and price promotions.\nThe concept was imported in Romania by eMAG [ro] and Flanco in 2011 and became bigger each year. The two reported the biggest Black Friday sales in 2014. eMAG sold products worth some 37 million euros while Flanco's sales totaled 22 million euros. Hundreds of retailers announced their participation in the 2015 campaign.[70]\nIn 2015, 11 million Romanians say they have heard about Black Friday which is 73% of the 15 million people target segment. 6.7 million plan on buying something on biggest shopping event of the year in Romania.[71]\nThe holiday shopping season in India has traditionally been aligned around the \"festive period\" of major festivals usually falling around October, such as Diwali.[72][73][74] Seeking to emulate U.S.-style shopping events such as Black Friday, online retailers adopted the practice of holding multi-day promotions during this period, such as Amazon's \"Great Indian Festival\" and Flipkart's \"Big Billion Days\". India's Independence Day (15 August) had also recently attracted similar events.[74][75]\nNonetheless, the concept of Black Friday has also been imported into the subcontinent via international retailers\u2013a move that influenced some Indian retailers to also adopt the promotion.[74][76]\nFrench businesses are slowly introducing the Black Friday custom into the market.[77] Discounts of up to 85% were given by retailing giants such as Apple and Amazon in 2014.[78] French electronics retailers such as FNAC and Auchan advertised deals online, while Darty also took part in this once-a-year monster sale. Retailers favored the very American term \"Black Friday\" to \"Vendredi noir\" in their advertisements.[79] In 2016, because of the terror attacks in Paris in November the year before, some retailers used the name \"Jour XXL\" (XXL day) instead of Black Friday.[80] An alternative was brought up by some online businesses in 2018, called \"French Days\",[81] which goal is to replicate Black Friday during spring season (starting around the first day of May).\nOn November 20, 2020, the French government finalized an agreement with e-commerce businesses like Amazon and supermarket chains to postpone Black Friday promotions by a week. Discounted shopping promotions were to begin on December 4 instead, after physical stores shuttered during the COVID-19 pandemic were allowed to reopen.[82]\nIn Germany, \"Black Friday\" retailer advertisements refer to \"Black Week\" and \"Black Shopping\" in English with sales lasting an entire week (excluding Sundays when most retail stores are closed). During this sales period, stores keep their normal working hours. Although goods are offered at reduced prices, the prices are not cut significantly more than normal weekly price reductions. Apple was the first company to run a special Black Friday campaign for the German market in 2006.[83] Apple never used the name Black Friday in Germany, but promotes only a \"one-day shopping event\".[84] In the first years, mostly internet retailers have used the event as an occasion to attract new customers with discounts, but bricks and mortar stores have already begun to adapt the shopping event. For the first time ever, German customers spent more than \u20ac1 billion during the Black Friday week-end in 2016: According to a Centre for Retail Research study, German customers spend around \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.54 billion) during the four days from Black Friday to Cyber Monday 2016.[85]\nIn Germany the term \"Black Friday\" was registered as a wordmark in December 2013. The owner is Super Union Holdings Limited, a Chinese company.[86] The trademark rights were largely revoked by the German Federal Patent Court and the German Federal Court of Justice. The trademark protection has thus essentially lapsed.[87]\nIn 2015, Swiss retailer Manor was the first to launch a special Black Friday promotion. The year after, most Swiss retailers launched special offers during the Black Friday Week. It is estimated that customers spent around 400 million Swiss Francs on Black Friday 2018. In recent years, Singles Day got more and more important in Switzerland. This shopping day could replace Black Friday as the most important shopping day in Switzerland in 2019[88]\nIn Australia, the term is controversial,[89][90] as prior to its popularisation as a shopping day, it referred not to shopping at all, but to the devastating Black Friday bushfires that occurred in Victoria 1938\u201339.[89][90][91][92] It was not until the 2010s that it was heavily promoted as a shopping day in Australia by in-store and online retailers, despite backlash and confusion by consumers. In 2011, Online Shopping USA hosted an event on Twitter. Twitter users had to use the hashtag #osublackfriday, which allowed them to follow along and tweet their favourite deals and discounts from stores.[93] In 2013, Apple extended its Black Friday deals to Australia. Purchasing online gave customers free shipping and free iTunes gift cards with every purchase. The deals were promoted on its website, reading \"Official Apple Store \u2013 One day Apple shopping event Friday, November 29\".[94]Australia Post's ShopMate parcel-forwarding service allows Australian customers to purchase products with \"Black Friday\" deals from the US and get them shipped to Australia. ShopMate ran from 2014-2022. It closed in February 2022 amid controversy about shipping costs. [95]\nIn addition to this service, numerous stores in the country run Black Friday promotions in-store and online throughout the country.[96]\nIn Norway, Black Friday started as a publicity stunt campaign back in 2010 to increase the sales to the shopping mall Norwegian Outlet. Since the introduction, it has been promoted every year in a larger and growing market all over the country.[99]\nBlack Friday is known as Viernes Negro in Costa Rica.[100] In Panama, Black Friday was first celebrated in 2012, as a move from the Government to attract local tourism to the country's capital city. During its first year, it was believed to have attracted an inflow of about 35,000 regional tourists according to the government's immigration census.\nIn Liechtenstein and Switzerland, Black Friday Sale is a joint sales initiative by hundreds of online vendors. Over its first 24-hour run on November 28, 2013, more than 1.2 million people visited the site, making it the single largest online shopping event in German-speaking countries. There has been growing interest for Black Friday in Poland as well.\nFor the Middle East, U.A.E. Black Friday started as White Friday campaign in 2014. In 2018 local e-commerce platform noon.com created Yellow Friday in the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia. The Yellow Friday Sale is now an annual event in Saudi Arabia, Iran and the U.A.E., falling around the same time as Black Friday globally.\nIn 2015, Spain joined with some small retailers. The celebration became more famous year by year, until the big retailers grew.\nIn the Netherlands, Black Friday was seriously introduced in 2015. Some years before, there were already a number of large and small retailers that used Black Friday in their marketing. However, with a total of 35 participating stores, 2015 can be considered the year in which Black Friday started in the Netherlands due to a more widespread support of large retailers. The popularity of Black Friday has grown rapidly in the Netherlands. The number of participating stores has increased to over 125 during the Black Friday period of 2017. For the 2018 edition, 166 shops joined the largest black Friday platform in the Netherlands.\nBlack Friday in Belgium is seriously marketed by retailers since 2016. Especially online shops have broke sales records during the last edition of Black Friday, which provides a base for further growth of popularity of Black Friday in Belgium. After 2016, Black Friday in Belgium has grown strongly. The participating shops have increased to over seventy during the Black Friday period of 2017. During Black Friday 2018, a total of 119 participating stores were measured in Belgium.\nIn 2017, Black Friday became widely popular in Latvia. There was even a Black week and Black week-end sales in shopping centres.\nBlack Friday has been increasingly adopted by stores in Brazil since 2010,[106] although not without its share of inflated prices and other scams, especially in its earlier years, earning the nickname \"Black Fraude\"[107] (Black Fraud) or also \"Black Furadei\", which comes from the slang word \"furada\", meaning a \"jam\" or tough situation, usually involving money. It is also common to hear Brazilian people say that prices on Brazilian Black Friday are \"half of the double\". However, currently, the term \"Black Friday\" has become so popular in the country that stores have been under closer scrutiny from consumers and cases of known scams have been reduced greatly[citation needed].\nDespite frequent attempts to control the crowds of shoppers, minor injuries are common among the crowds, usually as a result of being pushed or thrown to the ground in small stampedes. While most injuries remain minor, serious injuries and even deliberate violence have taken place on some Black Fridays.\nIn 2008, a crowd of approximately 2,000 shoppers in Valley Stream, New York, waited outside for the 05:00 opening of the local Walmart. As opening time approached, the crowd grew anxious and when the doors were opened, the crowd pushed forward, breaking the door down, and 34-year-old employee Jdimytai Damour was trampled to death. The shoppers did not appear concerned with the victim's fate, expressing refusal to halt their stampede when other employees attempted to intervene and help the injured employee, complaining that they had been waiting in the cold and were not willing to wait any longer. Shoppers had begun assembling as early as 21:00 the evening before. Even when police arrived and attempted to render aid to the injured man, shoppers continued to pour in, shoving and pushing the officers as they made their way into the store. Several other people incurred minor injuries, including a pregnant woman who had to be taken to the hospital.[108][109][110] The incident may be the first case of a death occurring during Black Friday sales; according to the National Retail Federation, \"We are not aware of any other circumstances where a retail employee has died working on the day after Thanksgiving.\"[108]\nOn the same day, two people were fatally shot during an altercation at a Toys 'R' Us in Palm Desert, California.[111]\nA man was arrested at a Florida Wal-Mart on drug and weapons charges after other shoppers waiting in line for the store to open noticed he was carrying a handgun and reported it to the police. He was discovered to also be carrying two knives and a pepper spray grenade.[115] A man in Buffalo, New York, was trampled when doors opened at a Target store and unruly shoppers rushed in, in an episode reminiscent of the deadly 2008 Wal-Mart stampede.[116]\nOn Black Friday 2011, a woman at a Porter Ranch, CaliforniaWalmart used pepper spray on fellow shoppers, causing minor injuries to a reported 20 people who had been waiting hours for the store to open. The incident started as people waited in line for the newly discounted Xbox 360. A witness said a woman with two children in tow became upset with the way people were pushing in line. The witness said she pulled out pepper spray and sprayed the other people in line. Another account stated: \"The store had brought out a crate of discounted Xbox 360s, and a crowd had formed to wait for the unwrapping, when the woman began spraying people 'in order to get an advantage,' according to the police.[117] In an incident outside a Walmart store in San Leandro, California, one man was wounded after being shot following Black Friday shopping at about 1:45 a.m.[118] A 61-year-old pharmacist collapsed and was left for dead by shoppers while being trampled and passed by a stampede. He died soon after from his injuries.[119]\nOn Black Friday in 2013, a person in Las Vegas who was carrying a big-screen TV home from a Target store on Thanksgiving was shot in the leg as he tried to wrestle the item back from a robber who had just stolen it from him at gunpoint.[121] In Romeoville, Illinois, a police officer shot a suspected shoplifter driving a car that was dragging a fellow officer at a Kohl's department store. The suspect and the dragged officer were treated for shoulder injuries. Three people were arrested.[122] In another situation, a 29-year-old shopper was arrested in a Walmart in New Jersey after arguing with a store manager about a TV and attacking an officer. He was charged with disorderly conduct, aggravated assault, and resisting arrest[123]\nIn 2014, three buyers were arrested after a group of five people started fighting at a Kohl's store in Tustin, California. Two female victims were found with facial lacerations, and one of them was taken to hospital with minor injuries, while the other was released on scene. According to officials, three other females were suspects for the assault and were taken into custody.[124] Two people were arrested after a brawl on Black Friday at a northwest side mall in Indianapolis. In Los Angeles, two women were fighting at a Walmart in Norwalk, California, over a Barbie doll on Thanksgiving night.[125]\nSeveral people fighting at a mall in Florence, Kentucky, allegedly over a pair of Air Jordan sneakers. This year was called \"The worst Black Friday brawls in history\" at that time due to the heavy use of smartphones that could instantly capture video.[126]\nIn 2016, 21-year-old Demond Cottman was shot and killed around 01:00 Friday morning outside a Macy's store in New Jersey. The shooter fired multiple shots, leaving an SUV covered in bullet holes, but the motives remain unclear. Cottman's 26-year-old brother was also injured.[127] A shooting at the Wolfchase Galleria Mall in Memphis, Tennessee, left one man injured. Derrick Blackburn, 19, was later arrested for unlawful possession of a weapon.[128]\nIn Vancouver, a shirtless man attacked several people using his belt as a whip. The incident occurred outside an Adidas store where a crowd was awaiting the release of a rare shoe.[129]\nAt the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Alabama, Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., was shot and killed by a security guard after two people were wounded in a shooting.[130] On Saturday, the police announced that the shooter was not Bradford, but claimed he was involved in the shooting.[131][132]\nA fight led to a shooting in the food court of the Destiny USA mall in Syracuse, New York.[133] The mall went into lockdown until shoppers and staff were released starting at about 8:00 P.M. with all shopping activity suspended.[133] 21-year-old Kyree Truax was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, and second-degree reckless endangerment for shooting the victim twice in the leg.[134]\nSome online stores invest a lot of money in promotional campaigns to generate more sales and drive traffic to their stores. However, they often forget about the high loads their sites are going to experience. According to Retail Gazette, \"A number of major retailers' websites went down as they failed to cope with the surge in Black Friday traffic in 2017... This just highlights that some retailers have not taken the necessary steps to prepare for Black Friday. Failing to prepare for peak can cause poor performance, site downtime, and ultimately lost revenue for retailers\".[135] Such carelessness results in huge reputational damage. Moreover, The 2017 Veeam Availability Report shows that \"Unplanned downtime costs organisations around the world an average of R270m annually, up from the R210m of the previous year\".[136]\nSome websites offer information about day-after-Thanksgiving specials up to a month in advance.[137] The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\nThe benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An Internet service provider in 2003 brought suit against Best Buy, Kohl's, and Target Corporation, arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have standing to sue the retailers.[139]\nUsage of Black Friday Advertising Tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the U.S., influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002.[140] The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties, and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult. Cross-border shopping solutions exist to mitigate the problem through estimation of the various cost involved.\nIn 2019, Adobe shopping data showed that around 39% of the shopping was done through smartphones.[141] In 2022, 48% of online sales are made through smartphones, up from 44% in 2021. Meanwhile, consumers spent a record $9.12 billion shopping online during Black Friday this year.[142]\nThe term Cyber Monday, a neologism invented in 2005 by the National Retail Federation's division Shop.org,[143] refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday based on a trend that retailers began to recognize in 2003 and 2004. Retailers noticed that many consumers, who were too busy to shop over the Thanksgiving week-end or did not find what they were looking for, shopped for bargains online that Monday from home or work. In 2010, Hitwise reported:\nThanksgiving weekend offered a strong start, especially as Black Friday sales continued to grow in popularity. For the 2nd consecutive year, Black Friday was the highest day for retail traffic during the holiday season, followed by Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. The highest year-over-year increases in visits took place on Cyber Monday and Black Friday with a growth of 16% and 13%, respectively.[144]\nIn 2013, Cyber Monday online sales grew by 18% over the previous year, hitting a record $1.73 billion, with an average order value of $128.[145]\nIn 2014, Cyber Monday was the busiest day of the year with sales exceeding $2 billion in desktop online spending, up 17% from the previous year.[146]\nAs reported in the Forbes \"Entrepreneurs\" column on December 3, 2013: \"Cyber Monday, the online counterpart to Black Friday, has been gaining unprecedented popularity \u2013 to the point where Cyber Sales are continuing on throughout the week.\"[147] Peter Greenberg, Travel Editor for CBS News, further advises: \"If you want a real deal on Black Friday, stay away from the mall. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are all part of Cyber Week...\"[148]\nThe National Retail Federation releases figures on the sales for each Thanksgiving week-end.[149] The Federation's definition of \"Black Friday week-end\" includes Thursday, Friday, Saturday and projected spending for Sunday. The survey estimates number of shoppers, not number of people.\nThe length of the shopping season is not the same across all years: the date for Black Friday varies between November 23 and 29, while Christmas Eve is fixed at December 24.",

        "question": "When does this year's Passover start?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover#:~:text=2023%C2%A0date,(8%20days)",
        "context": "\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, God (Yahweh) commanded Moses to tell the Israelites to mark a lamb's blood above their doors in order that the Angel of Death would pass over them (i.e., that they would not be touched by the tenth plague, death of the firstborn). After the death of the firstborn, Pharaoh ordered the Israelites to leave, taking whatever they want, and asked Moses to bless him in the name of the Lord. The passage goes on to state that the Passover sacrifice recalls the time when God \"passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt\".[4] This story is recounted at the Passover meal during the first two evenings of Passover by reading the Haggadah. The Haggadah is a standardized ritual account of the Exodus story, in fulfillment of the command \"And thou shalt tell [Higgadata] thy son in that day, saying: It is because of that which the LORD did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.\"[5]\nNowadays, in addition to the biblical prohibition of owning leavened foods for the duration of the holiday, the Passover Seder, at which the Haggadah is read aloud, is one of the most widely observed rituals in Judaism.\nThe Hebrew\u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7\u200e is rendered as Tiberian[p\u025bsa\u0127]\u24d8, and Modern Hebrew: [\u02c8pesa\u03c7]Pesah, Pesakh. The verb pas\u00e0ch (\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7) is first mentioned in the Torah's account of the Exodus from Egypt,[6] and there is some debate about its exact meaning. The commonly held assumption that it means \"He passed over\" (\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7), in reference to God \"passing over\" (or \"skipping\") the houses of the Hebrews during the final of the Ten Plagues of Egypt, stems from the translation provided in the Septuagint (Ancient Greek: \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, romanized: pareleusetai in Exodus 12:23,[6] and \u1f10\u03c3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd, eskepasen in Exodus 12:27.)[4]Targum Onkelos translates pesach as ve-yei\u1e25os (Hebrew: \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05e1, romanized: we-y\u0113\u1e25\u00f4s), \"he had pity\", coming from the Hebrew root \u05d7\u05e1\u05d4, meaning \"to have pity\".[7] Cognate languages yield similar terms with distinct meanings, such as \"make soft, soothe, placate\" (Akkadianpassahu), \"harvest, commemoration, blow\" (Egyptian), or \"separate\" (Arabicfsh).[8]\nThe term Pesach (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7, Pesa\u1e25) may also refer to the lamb or goat which was designated as the Passover sacrifice (called the Korban Pesach in Hebrew). Four days before the Exodus, the Hebrews were commanded to set aside a lamb,[9] and inspect it daily for blemishes. During the day on the 14th of Nisan, they were to slaughter the animal and use its blood to mark their lintels and door posts. Before midnight on the 15th of Nisan they were to consume the lamb.\nFor the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.[12]\nThe Passover ritual is \"a mitzvah commanded by Torah (rather than of rabbinic origin).\"[13]\nThe Passover ritual is thought by modern scholars to have its origins in an apotropaic rite, unrelated to the Exodus, to ensure the protection of a family home, a rite conducted wholly within a clan.[14]Hyssop was employed to daub the blood of a slaughtered sheep on the lintels and door posts to ensure that demonic forces could not enter the home.[15]\nA further hypothesis maintains that once the Priestly Code was promulgated, the Exodus narrative took on a central function, as the apotropaic rite was, arguably, amalgamated with the Canaanite agricultural festival of spring which was a ceremony of unleavened bread, connected with the barley harvest. As the Exodus motif grew, the original function and symbolism of these double origins was lost.[16] Several motifs replicate the features associated with the MesopotamianAkitu spring festival, which celebrates the sowing of barley.[17] Scholars John Van Seters, J.B.Segal and Tamara Prosic disagree with the merged two-festivals hypothesis.[18]\nIn the Book of Exodus, the Israelites are enslaved in ancient Egypt. Yahweh, the god of the Israelites, appears to Moses in a burning bush and commands Moses to confront Pharaoh. To show his power, Yahweh inflicts a series of 10 plagues on the Egyptians, culminating in the 10th plague, the death of the first-born.\nThis is what the LORD says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt \u2013 worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.\"\n\u2014 Exodus 11:4\u20136\nBefore this final plague Yahweh commands Moses to tell the Israelites to mark a lamb's blood above their doors in order that Yahweh will pass over them (i.e., that they will not be touched by the death of the firstborn).\nThe biblical regulations for the observance of the festival require that all leavening be disposed of before the beginning of the 15th of Nisan.[19] An unblemished lamb or goat, known as the Korban Pesach or \"Paschal Lamb\", is to be set apart on 10th Nisan,[9] and slaughtered at dusk as 14th Nisan ends in preparation for the 15th of Nisan when it will be eaten after being roasted.[20] The literal meaning of the Hebrew is \"between the two evenings\".[21] It is then to be eaten \"that night\", 15th Nisan,[22] roasted, without the removal of its internal organs[23] with unleavened bread, known as matzo, and bitter herbs known as maror.[22] Nothing of the sacrifice on which the sun rises by the morning of the 15th of Nisan may be eaten, but must be burned.[24]\nThe biblical regulations pertaining to the original Passover, at the time of the Exodus only, also include how the meal was to be eaten: \"with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover\".[25]\nThe biblical requirements of slaying the Paschal lamb in the individual homes of the Hebrews and smearing the blood of the lamb on their doorways were celebrated in Egypt. However, once Israel was in the wilderness and the tabernacle was in operation, a change was made in those two original requirements.[26] Passover lambs were to be sacrificed at the door of the tabernacle and no longer in the homes of the Jews. No longer, therefore, could blood be smeared on doorways.\nIn the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk is the LORD's Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.\nThe sacrifices may be performed only in a specific place prescribed by God. For Judaism, this is Jerusalem.[27]\nThe biblical commandments concerning the Passover (and the Feast of Unleavened Bread) stress the importance of remembering:\nExodus 12:14 commands, in reference to God's sparing of the firstborn from the Tenth Plague: \"And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.\"[28]\nExodus 13:3 repeats the command to remember: \"Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength the hand of the LORD brought you out from this place.\"[29]\nDeuteronomy 16:12: \"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes\".[30]\nIn 2 Kings 23:21\u201323 and 2 Chronicles 35:1\u201319, King Josiah of Judah restores the celebration of the Passover,[31] to a standard not seen since the days of the judges or the days of the prophetSamuel.[32]\nSome of these details can be corroborated, and to some extent amplified, in extrabiblical sources. The removal (or \"sealing up\") of the leaven is referred to in the Elephantine papyri, an Aramaic papyrus from 5th century BCE Elephantine in Egypt.[34] The slaughter of the lambs on the 14th is mentioned in The Book of Jubilees, a Jewish work of the Ptolemaic period, and by the Herodian-era writers Josephus and Philo. These sources also indicate that \"between the two evenings\" was taken to mean the afternoon.[35]Jubilees states the sacrifice was eaten that night,[36] and together with Josephus states that nothing of the sacrifice was allowed to remain until morning.[37] Philo states that the banquet included hymns and prayers.[38]\nThe Passover begins on the 15th day of the month of Nisan, which at present falls between March 26 and April 25 of the Gregorian calendar.[39] The 15th day begins in the evening, after the 14th day, and the seder meal is eaten that evening. Passover is a spring festival, so the 15th day of Nisan typically begins on the night of a full moon after the northern vernal equinox.[40] However, due to leap months falling after the vernal equinox, Passover sometimes starts on the second full moon after vernal equinox, as in 2016.\nTo ensure that Passover did not start before spring, the tradition in ancient Israel held that the lunar new year, the first day of Nisan, would not start until the barley was ripe, being the test for the onset of spring.[41] If the barley was not ripe, or various other phenomena[42] indicated that spring was not yet imminent, an intercalary month (Adar II) would be added. However, since at least the 4th century, the intercalation has been fixed mathematically according to the Metonic cycle.[43]\nIn Israel, Passover is the seven-day holiday of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, with the first and last days celebrated as legal holidays and as holy days involving holiday meals, special prayer services, and abstention from work; the intervening days are known as Chol HaMoed (\"Weekdays [of] the Festival\"). Jews outside of Israel celebrate the festival for eight days. Reform and Reconstructionist Jews usually celebrate the holiday over seven days.[44][45][46]Karaites use a different version of the Jewish calendar, differing from that used with modern Jewish calendar by one or two days.[47] The Samaritans use a calendrical system that uses a different method from that current in Jewish practice, in order to determine their timing of feastdays.[48] In 2009, for example, Nisan 15 on the Jewish calendar used by Rabbinic Judaism corresponds to April 9. On the calendars used by Karaites and Samaritans, Abib or Aviv 15 (as opposed to 'Nisan') corresponds to April 11 in 2009. The Karaite and Samaritan Passovers are each one day long, followed by the six-day Festival of Unleavened Bread \u2013 for a total of seven days.[49]\nThe main entity in Passover according to Judaism is the sacrificial lamb.[50] During the existence of the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem, the focus of the Passover festival was the Passover sacrifice (Hebrew: korban Pesach), also known as the Paschal lamb, eaten during the Passover Seder on the 15th of Nisan. Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan,[51] and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan.[52] If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened,[53] and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed[54] and eaten together with unleavened bread (matzo) and bitter herbs (maror). One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering,[55] and none of the meat could be left over by morning.[56]\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an apostate,[57] a servant,[58] an uncircumcised man[59] a person in a state of ritual impurity, except when a majority of Jews are in such a state,[60] and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a quorum of 30.[61] In the Temple, the Levites sang Hallel while the priests performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (Pesahim 91b).\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the mitzvah of the Korban Pesach is memorialized in the Seder Korban Pesach, a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the Mincha (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th of Nisan,[62] and in the form of the zeroa, a symbolic food placed on the Passover Seder Plate (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted shankbone (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the afikoman substitutes for the eating of the Korban Pesach at the end of the Seder meal (Mishnah Pesachim 119a). Many Sephardi Jews have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the Korban Pesach.\nWashing dishes for passover (1657)Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins\nLeaven, in Hebrew chametz (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05de\u05e5\u1e25amets, \"leavening\") is made from one of five types of grains[63] combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes. The consumption, keeping, and owning of chametz is forbidden during Passover. Yeast and fermentation are not themselves forbidden as seen for example by wine, which is required, rather than merely permitted. According to Halakha, the ownership of such chametz is also proscribed.[64]\nChametz does not include baking soda, baking powder or like products. Although these are defined in English as leavening agents, they leaven by chemical reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with baking soda and matzo meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.[65]\nThe Torah commandments regarding chametz are:\nTo remove all chametz from one's home, including things made with chametz, before the first day of Passover[66] It may be simply used up, thrown out (historically, destroyed by burning), or given or sold to non-Jews.\nTo refrain from eating chametz or mixtures containing chametz during Passover.[67]\nObservant Jews spend the weeks before Passover in a flurry of thorough housecleaning, to remove every morsel of chametz from every part of the home. Jewish law requires the elimination of olive-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the seams of kitchen counters are thoroughly cleaned to remove traces of flour and yeast, however small. Any containers or implements that have touched chametz are stored and not used during Passover.[69]\nSome scholars suggest that the command to abstain from leavened food or yeast suggests that sacrifices offered to God involve the offering of objects in \"their least altered state\", that would be nearest to the way in which they were initially made by God.[50][71] According to other scholars the absence of leaven or yeast means that leaven or yeast symbolizes corruption and spoiling.[50][72]\nThere are also variations with restrictions on eating matzah before Passover so that there will be an increased appetite for it during Passover itself. Primarily among Chabad Chassidim, there is a custom of not eating matzoh (flat unleavened bread) in the 30 days before Passover begins.[73] Others have a custom to refrain from eating matzah from Rosh Chodesh Nissan, while the halacha merely restricts one from eating matzah on the day before Passover.[74]\nKitniyot (Hebrew: \u05e7\u05b4\u05d8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, qitniyyot; literally \"small things\") refers to legumes, rice, maize, and other foods that are similar to grains. Ashkenazi Jews historically refrain from eating kitniyot on Passover, despite there not being a clear commandment to include them in the category of chametz.[75] Since the 19th century, the Reform movement has permitted eating kitniyot, and in 2015 the Conservative movement followed suit.[76]Sephardi Jews have always permitted eating kitniyot on Passover.\nGebrochts (Yiddish: \u05d2\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e7\u05d8\u05e1, lit.'broken', also known as Hebrew: \u05de\u05e6\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4, romanized:matzo shruya, lit.'soaked matzo') refers to matzo that has absorbed liquid. Some Hasidic Jews avoid gebrochts as well, to avoid the possibility that a clump of flour that was never properly mixed with water (and thus is still susceptible to leavening) may come into contact with the liquid.[77]\nChametz foods blocked from purchase during Passover in a Jerusalem supermarket\nLeaven or chametz may be sold rather than discarded, especially in the case of relatively valuable forms such as liquordistilled from wheat, with the products being repurchased afterward. In some cases, they may never leave the house, instead being formally sold while remaining in the original owner's possession in a locked cabinet until they can be repurchased after the holiday. Modern observance may also include sealing cabinets and drawers which contain \"Chametz\" shut by using adhesive tape, which serves a similar purpose to a lock but also shows evidence of tampering. Although the practice of selling \"Chametz\" dates back many years, some Reform rabbinical authorities have come to regard it with disdain \u2013 since the supposed \"new owner\" never takes actual possession of the goods.[78]\nThe sale of chametz may also be conducted communally via a rabbi, who becomes the \"agent\" for all the community's Jews through a halakhic procedure called a kinyan (acquisition). Each householder must put aside all the chametz he is selling into a box or cupboard, and the rabbi enters into a contract to sell all the chametz to a non-Jew (who is not obligated to celebrate the commandments) in exchange for a small down payment (e.g. $1.00), with the remainder due after Passover. This sale is considered completely binding according to Halakha, and at any time during the holiday, the buyer may come to take or partake of his property. The rabbi then re-purchases the goods for less than they were sold at the end of the holiday.[79]\nOn the night of the fourteenth of Nisan, the night before the Passover Seder (after nightfall on the evening before Passover eve), Jews do a formal search in their homes known as bedikat chametz for any possible remaining leaven (chametz). The Talmudic sages instructed that a search for chametz be made in every home, place of work, or any place where chametz may have been brought during the year.[80] When the first Seder is on a Saturday night, the search is conducted on the preceding Thursday night (thirteenth of Nisan) as chametz cannot be burned during Shabbat.\nThe Talmud in Pesahim (p. 2a) derives from the Torah that the search for chametz be conducted by the light of a candle and therefore is done at night, and although the final destruction of the chametz (usually by burning it in a small bonfire) is done on the next morning, the blessing is made at night because the search is both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all chametz from one's possession.[80]\nBefore the search is begun there is a special blessing. If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:[80]\nBlessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by candlelight, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the chametz. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for chametz will be in vain (bracha l'vatala) if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some chametz will be found.\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\nAny chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on Motza'ei Shabbat), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the Fast of the Firstborn which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to Exodus 12:29, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected.[81] However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a siyum (ceremony marking the completion of a section of Torah learning) right after morning prayers, and the celebratory meal that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\nOn the morning of the 14th of Nisan, any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (s'rayfat chametz). The head of the household repeats the declaration of biyur chametz, declaring any chametz that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\nAny chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\nShould more chametz actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\nUnlike chametz, which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" Passover sacrifice (Korban Pesach) has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the Second Jewish temple approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in Exodus 12:3\u201311.[82]\nEven Kosher for Passover matzah cannot be eaten all day Erev Pesach.[83] Some even practice this up to 30 days before.[84] In some way this restriction is analogous[citation needed] to how the blowing of the Shofar, done by Ashkenazic Jews the month preceding Rosh Hashana, is not done on the day before that Holiday.\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat chametz (leaven) during Passover,[66] observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with chametz, for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some chametz utensils can be immersed in boiling water (hagalat keilim) to purge them of any traces of chametz that may have accumulated during the year. Many Sephardic families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that glass does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a blow torch to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called libun gamur).[85]\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is matzo, an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.[86] Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the Passover Seder. There are several explanations for this.\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.[87] Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\nMatzo has also been called Lechem Oni (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\"). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.[88]\nHand-made shmura matzo\nShmura matzo (\"watched\" or \"guarded\" matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in Orthodox Jewish communities. Shmura matzo is made from wheat that is guarded from contamination by leaven (chametz) from the time of summer harvest[63] to its baking into matzos five to ten months later.\nIn the weeks before Passover, matzos are prepared for holiday consumption. In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"chaburas\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. Chaburas also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,[63] as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;[89] this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now chametz, and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.[63]\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in Orthodox and Conservative communities outside Israel) for a special dinner called a seder (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05d3\u05e8seder \u2013 derived from the Hebrew word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the Haggadah. A total of four cups of wine are consumed during the recitation of the Haggadah. The seder is divided by the haggadah into the following 15 parts:\nKadeish/ Qad\u0113sh\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9 \u2013 recital of Kiddush blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine\nThe seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of Kiddush which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the afikoman, the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including Chad Gadya (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\nMaror (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in Egypt. The following verse from the Torah underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered (Hebrew: \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5 ve-yimareru) their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" (Exodus 1:14).\nSilver seder plate\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of the Exodus, the drinking of the third cup concludes Birkat Hamazon and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel. A fifth cup of wine is poured near the end of the seder for Eliyahu HaNavi, a symbol of the future redemption, which is left un-touched.[91]\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\nWhy is this night different from all other nights?\nOn all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\nOn all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\nOn all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\nOn all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about the Exodus from Egypt, the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n14th century Haggadah\nThe afikoman \u2013 an integral part of the Seder itself \u2013 is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called Yachatz, the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the afikoman. Many families use the afikoman as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the afikoman and offering a prize for its return.[63] Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the afikoman and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the afikoman must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, Tzafun.\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"Next year in Jerusalem!\". This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. \"Echad Mi Yodea\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"Chad Gadya\" are allegorical.\nDuring Passover, the recitation of Hallel a collection of Psalms praising and thanking God, is an integral part of the daily prayer service. On the initial day(s) of Passover, it is recited in its entirety, similar to the practice observed on Shavuot and throughout Succot. However, for the subsequent days of the Passover holiday, only half of the Hallel is recited. This traditional practice is widely observed by adherents of the Jewish faith as a way of expressing gratitude and celebrating the significance of Passover, while maintaining variations in the recitation of Hallel based on specific days within the festival.[92][93]\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,[94] Jews begin the practice of the Counting of the Omer, a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of Shavuot 50 days hence. Each night after the evening prayer service, men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.[95]\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an issaron for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.[96]\nSince the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and mitzvot before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering \u2013 a measure of barley, typically animal fodder \u2013 and the Shavuot offering \u2013 two loaves of wheat bread, human food \u2013 symbolizes the transition process.[97]\nOutside Israel, in Orthodox and Conservative communities, the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays. In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. Reform Judaism observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\nLike the holiday of Sukkot, the intermediary days of Passover are known as Chol HaMoed (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as macaroons and homemade candies.[98]\nPassover cake recipes call for potato starch or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use matzo farfel (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base. For families with Eastern European backgrounds, borsht, a soup made with beets, is a Passover tradition.[99]\nWhile kosher for Passover packaged goods are available in stores, some families opt to cook everything from scratch during Passover week. In Israel, families that do not kasher their ovens can bake cakes, casseroles, and even meat[100] on the stovetop in a Wonder Pot, an Israeli invention consisting of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a center hole which is placed between the Wonder Pot and the flame to disperse heat.[101]\nShvi'i shel Pesach (\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7, 'seventh [day] of Passover') is another full Jewish holiday, with special prayer services and festive meals. Outside the Israel, in the Jewish diaspora, Shvi'i shel Pesach is celebrated on both the seventh and eighth days of Passover.[102] This holiday commemorates the day the Children of Israel reached the Red Sea and witnessed both the miraculous \"Splitting of the Sea\" (Passage of the Red Sea), the drowning of all the Egyptian chariots, horses and soldiers that pursued them. According to the Midrash, only the Pharaoh was spared to give testimony to the miracle that occurred.\nHasidicRebbes traditionally hold a tish on the night of Shvi'i shel Pesach and place a cup or bowl of water on the table before them. They use this opportunity to speak about the Splitting of the Sea to their disciples, and sing songs of praise to God.[103]\nToday, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has the status of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it essentially does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.[107]\nCharoset \u2013 A sweet mixture of fruit, fresh, dried or both; nuts; spices; honey; and sometimes wine. The charoset is a symbol of the mortar the Israelites used for building while enslaved in Egypt (See Passover seder)\nThat slaves can go free, and that the future can be better than the present, has inspired a number of religious sermons, prayers, and songs \u2013 including spirituals (what used to be called \"Negro Spirituals\"), within the African-American community. Philip R. Alstat, known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills, wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the Passover story during the rise of Nazi persecution and terror:[109]\nSome see in Passover an important ecological lesson important to the contemporary situation with different ecological threats like climate change. For example, Rabbi Yonatan Neril, founder and executive director of the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development compare the impacts of climate change to the Plagues of Egypt and the refusal of modern society to change its way of thinking is compared to the refusal of the Pharaoh to free the Jewish slaves.[126] Scientists discover evidence for a climatic change in the end of the ruling of Ramesses II which can potentially impact the flow of Nile, leading to Red algae bloom which can potentially cause effects close to those described as the ten plagues. According to Neril: \"\"The Egyptians were very happy to have a free source of labor in the form of Israelite slaves. When God said this needs to stop, they were reluctant to change,\" \"Fossil fuels, in the past 150 years, have replaced slave labor as the key driver of human society. There's a Pharaoh within us that wants to continue to do something that's not right.\"[127][128]\n^James B.

Christ as the Passover Lamb from Exodus A number of features throughout Revelation seem to correspond to Exodus 12: The connection of Lamb and Passover, a salvific effect of the Lamb's blood and the punishment of God's (and His people's) opponents from Exodus 12 may possibly be reflected within the settings of the Apocalypse. The concept of Christ as a Passover lamb is generally not unknown in NT or early Christian literature, as can for instance be seen in 1 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Peter 1:19 or Justin Martyr's writing (Dial. 111:3). In the Gospel of John, especially, this connection between Christ and Passover is made very explicit.",

        "context": "\nThere have been 1,310 preliminary filtered reported tornadoes[2] and 1,180 confirmed tornadoes in the United States in 2023. Worldwide, 108 tornado-related deaths have been confirmed, 75 of them in the United States, 12 in China, nine in Indonesia, eight in Myanmar, three in Turkey, and one in Saudi Arabia.\nJanuary saw the third-highest number of tornado watches and confirmed tornadoes of any January on record in the United States.[3] Additionally, the first two months of the year saw the fourth-highest number of confirmed tornadoes for the first 59 days of any year on record.[4] In addition, the year has been deadlier than average, with multiple fatal tornadoes. By April 5, 63 deaths from tornadoes had been recorded in the United States; this was almost three times higher than 2022's total of 23 deaths and approaching the annual average of roughly 70 deaths.[5] Although below average tornadic activity occurred in May, near average tornado activity caused an additional nine deaths in June.\nIn early January, a three-day severe weather outbreak brought damaging winds, large hail, and numerous tornadoes to the Southern United States and impacted the Midwestern United States to a lesser extent. On January 2, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for all of Arkansas and parts of surrounding states, with a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes. An EF1 tornado damaged homes and the high school in Jessieville, Arkansas, injuring two people.[8][9][10] A large 1.1-mile-wide (1.8 km) EF2 tornado caused severe damage near Jonesboro, Louisiana, snapping many large trees, inflicting significant damage to several residences, and injuring three people.[8] Another strong EF2 tornado knocked down metal truss electrical transmission towers near Haile and destroyed an outbuilding. A third large, long-tracked EF2 tornado damaged or destroyed multiple houses, vehicles, and a mobile home in Montrose, Arkansas, and snapped or uprooted countless trees and many power poles along its path.[8][11] The next day, another enhanced risk was issued farther east in the Gulf Coast region, with a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes in place for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. An EF2 tornado downed many large trees, tore most of the roof off a house, caused roof damage to other homes, and destroyed boathouses and outbuildings at the Jordan Lake Reservoir near Deatsville, Alabama. Several tornadoes touched down as far north as Illinois, including two separate EF0 and EF1 tornadoes that caused damage to outbuildings and farm equipment near Maroa. Another pair of EF1 and EF0 tornadoes also briefly touched down in Decatur, with the EF1 tornado damaging a vacant bowling alley and the EF0 tornado causing minor damage at Richland Community College. Tornadoes continued touching down into the morning of January 4, including a high-end EF1 tornado that damaged several homes, flipped cars, and severely injured a person on the eastern side of Montgomery, Alabama. In Georgia, an EF1 tornado struck the small community of Roosterville, where a barn and a mobile home were destroyed. An EF1 tornado also struck Sandersville, where homes and a warehouse were damaged and many trees were downed, some of which landed on structures. A semi-truck was overturned in Sandersville, injuring the driver.[8][12] Additional weak tornadoes touched down across parts of the Carolinas later that day before the outbreak came to an end.\nNEXRAD velocity imagery showing the paths of six tornadoes near Griffin, Georgia. The circulation in the red circle is the one that produced the main EF3 Griffin tornado, while the one in the pink produced the deadly EF2 Jackson Lake tornado.\nA significant tornado outbreak impacted the Southeastern United States, with several strong and long-tracked tornadoes touching down and causing multiple fatalities. On January 12, the SPC issued an enhanced risk of severe weather, including a 10% risk area for tornadoes. Multiple supercell thunderstorms formed in the threat area later that day, and significant tornadoes began touching down. In Alabama, the small towns of Emelle, Eutaw, and Movico were all impacted by EF2 tornadoes, resulting in extensive damage. A large high-end EF2 tornado also caused severe structural damage in Selma, Alabama. Many homes and businesses sustained major damage in Selma, and a daycare with 70 children plus workers was destroyed, but only one minor injury occurred inside, one of two injuries reported from the tornado. The same storm that produced the Selma tornado later produced a long-tracked EF3 tornado that prompted tornado emergencies for Autauga, Elmore, Chilton, Coosa, and northern Tallapoosa counties.[21] This deadly tornado caused seven fatalities in the Old Kingston community of Autauga County as it completely obliterated numerous mobile homes, as well as tossing vehicles and causing massive timber damage.[22] Multiple strong tornadoes, which were all spawned by the Selma supercell, also impacted parts of Georgia, including an EF2 tornado that inflicted major damage to homes and industrial buildings in the southern part of LaGrange. A large EF3 tornado struck the western edge of Griffin and Experiment, badly damaging or destroying homes and businesses, and flipping cars. This tornado was accompanied by three other tornadoes at the beginning of its track near Griffin, including a high-end EF2 tornado that caused considerable damage to homes and trees. Another high-end EF2 tornado also caused significant damage in Jenkinsburg and near Jackson Lake, resulting in one fatality when a tree fell onto a car along with an indirect fatality the next day when falling tree limb knocked a transportation worker out of a bucket truck while he working to restore power lines.[23] A high-end EF1 tornado also touched down near the Atlanta suburb of Mableton, damaging an industrial business and downing many trees, some of which landed on homes. Other weak tornadoes were confirmed in parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and the Carolinas. Overall, this outbreak produced a total of 41 tornadoes and resulted in eight fatalities, along with at least 53 injuries.[24]\nOn January 17, a brief but strong tornado struck Valmontone, which is a comune in the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital, causing significant damage and injuring 2 people. The tornado was spawned by an embedded \"comma head\" circulation and was captured by a surveillance camera. Multiple homes, apartment buildings, and other structures suffered severe roof damage, and the top floor of one residence was completely destroyed. Trees, gates, and fences were knocked down, and debris was strewn across yards and roads. The European Severe Storms Laboratory rated the tornado F2 on the Fujita scale, with a path length of 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi) and a maximum width of 150 metres (160 yd).[25] After the tornado, Valmontone declared a state of disaster.[26]\nA line of severe storms produced damaging straight-line winds and multiple tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle and Southeast Georgia throughout January 22, including two low-end EF2 tornadoes. The first one struck the community of Turquoise Beach, Florida, to the northeast of Santa Rosa Beach, downing trees and damaging several homes. Three of the houses that were damaged had significant portions of their roofs uplifted.[27] The other strong tornado struck the northern side of Adel, Georgia, shifting multiple buildings off their foundations, including a metal structure that was completely destroyed. It also destroyed a motorhome, knocked over a series of centerline irrigation pivots, and damaged trees, some of which fell on homes.[27] Three EF1 tornadoes also touched down elsewhere in Georgia that day, bringing the final tornado tally to five.[8]\nNEXRAD radar data of the EF3 tornado in Deer Park, Texas. An annular ring of debris circling the tornado is visible on the correlation coefficient (bottom left)\nOn January 24, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for much of the Gulf Coast region, including a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes. Throughout the day, a small but significant outbreak of tornadoes impacted the Southern United States, primarily from Southeast Texas to southern Louisiana. Multiple strong tornadoes were confirmed, including a large and destructive low-end EF3 tornado that moved through the southeastern sections of the Houston metropolitan area, impacting the suburbs of Pasadena and Deer Park.[28] This prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency, the first ever issued by the National Weather Service's forecast office in Houston.[29][30] The intense rain-wrapped tornado inflicted major structural damage to many homes, apartment buildings, churches, and businesses, and downed many trees and power lines. Cars were thrown and mangled, a metal building was destroyed, a senior center sustained major damage, and metal truss electrical transmission towers were toppled to the ground. No fatalities occurred as a result of the EF3 Houston metro tornado, though a few minor injuries were reported. The tornado caused $6.6 million in damage.[31][32] The same storm also produced two EF0 tornadoes that caused minor damage in the Houston suburbs of Sienna and Pearland prior to spawning the EF3 tornado. Elsewhere, a brief EF2 tornado unroofed a house and destroyed a barn near Nome. Three people were injured by another EF2 tornado that touched down near Orangefield before striking the outskirts of Orange, causing major damage to mobile homes, houses, and outbuildings before crossing into Louisiana and inflicting more severe damage to numerous structures north of Vinton. Several metal buildings were also damaged, and many large trees were snapped or uprooted by this tornado as well. In Louisiana, another EF2 tornado struck the small community of Gaytine, where houses had their roofs torn off, a mobile home was destroyed, a metal building was heavily damaged, and a fifth-wheel RV trailer was flipped. In Ventress, three people were injured by an EF1 tornado that destroyed a few mobile homes.[33] Three additional weak tornadoes touched down in Florida on January 25 before the outbreak came to an end. A total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed. In addition to the tornadoes, the storms also produced flash flooding and a daily record for rainfall was set in Houston, at 4.05 in (103 mm).[34] The flash flooding forced SH 99 to temporarily close.[35]\nOn February 1, multiple severe thunderstorms formed in Germany, producing two tornadoes. The first was a short-lived F1 tornado which tracked for 0.2 km (0.1 mi), damaging the roofs of 14 homes in Hinte.[25][36] The second tornado struck areas near the small villages of Getmold, Lashorst and Hedem along a 5.3 km (3.3 mi)-long path, snapping or uprooting large trees and heavily damaging the roofs of multiple homes. A car was damaged by a falling tree near Lashorst, a carriage house had its roof torn off, and a carport was damaged at a farmstead. The most significant damage occurred in an area of pine forest, where many large trees were completely mowed down or stripped of their limbs, and a few tree trunks were snapped off and thrown some distance into nearby fields. Based on the severe tree damage, the second tornado was given an F2 rating.[25][37] Over 85 severe weather reports were documented in Europe that day, 69 of those in Germany.[25][38]\nLow-end EF2 damage to a gas station convenience store in Tangipahoa, Louisiana.\nOn February 8, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk of severe weather for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, including a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes. A line of severe storms produced damaging straight-line winds and multiple tornadoes in Mississippi and Louisiana throughout the day, a couple of which were strong. An EF2 tornado struck the village of Tangipahoa in eastern Louisiana, damaging trees and structures in town, including a church and gas station convenience store. Numerous mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in town, a vacant business was unroofed, and many trees were snapped or uprooted as well. Another EF2 tornado struck the community of Grand Prairie, Louisiana, where a well-built home had its roof torn off and trees were snapped. A few other homes and outbuildings along its path suffered more minor damage. Several other weaker tornadoes touched down during the evening across the same region. After roughly 24 hours of no activity, a ninth tornado associated with the same storm system touched down in the Florida Panhandle late on February 9, snapping or uprooting numerous trees near Eucheeanna. In total, nine tornadoes were confirmed.[8]\nEF2 damage to electrical transmission towers west of Ripley, Mississippi.\nOn February 16, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for parts of the Southeastern United States and the Ohio Valley region, including a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes in parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Severe thunderstorms developed later that day, producing damaging winds, large hail, and several tornadoes, a couple of which were strong. An EF2 tornado near Pindall, Arkansas, destroyed barns, pushed a house off its foundation, snapped trees, and injured two people.[39] Another EF2 tornado injured one person, snapped many trees, and knocked over a few metal truss electrical transmission towers near Ripley, Mississippi, before weakening and striking the north edge of town, where a few homes and businesses sustained minor damage. An EF1 tornado that occurred near Wesson, Mississippi, rolled and destroyed a mobile home, and damaged two other residences. An EF1 tornado near Ramer, Tennessee, inflicted heavy roof damage to a home and destroyed two garages, and another EF1 tornado near Lewisburg damaged homes, destroyed barns and outbuildings, and downed trees. On February 17, an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage as it moved through the south side of LaGrange, Georgia, not far from where a damaging EF2 tornado had struck the prior month. Many trees were snapped or uprooted in LaGrange, while homes and businesses sustained roof and window damage. Overall, a total of 13 tornadoes were confirmed. In addition to tornadoes, straight-line winds from the system led to a tree falling at the Northwestern University campus, injuring four people.[40] Flooding caused by the storms also killed two people, one in Kentucky and one in West Virginia.[41] Flooding also resulted in I-65 being shut down near Cullman, Alabama.[42]\nThe high-end EF2 Cheyenne, Oklahoma tornado, illuminated by a power flash.\nOn February 26, a large storm system produced a wide range of significant weather events across a large area of the United States, ranging from heavy snow to tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for west-central Oklahoma for a 45% hatched risk area for damaging winds. The outlook also included a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes. An enhanced risk also extended from the Texas Panhandle to southwestern Missouri. Aided by very strong wind shear, a powerful squall line of severe thunderstorms containing damaging straight-line winds and multiple embedded QLCS tornadoes formed and moved through the risk area later that night. A high-end EF2 tornado obliterated manufactured homes, tossed vehicles, and killed one person as it moved through the outskirts of Cheyenne, Oklahoma, injuring three others as well.[43] The line of severe storms also produced five tornadoes that impacted areas in and around the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, a couple of which were strong. This included a high-end EF2 tornado that struck the southeastern part of Norman, where homes and businesses sustained major damage, self-storage units were destroyed, cars were flipped, and 12 people were injured. Another high-end EF2 tornado also caused significant damage to homes and other structures near Shawnee. In addition, there were widespread reports of damaging straight-line winds that reached up to 70\u201380 mph (110\u2013130 km/h), with locally higher gusts reported, including a 114 mph (183 km/h) wind gust in Memphis, Texas.[44][45] Tornadic activity continued the next day in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio as the system pushed eastward. Several weak tornadoes occurred, including a high-end EF1 tornado that touched down in Jacksonburg, Ohio, before it passed near Middletown, causing considerable damage to a few homes, barns, and trees. In all, 30 tornadoes were confirmed, resulting in one tornado-related fatality; the 12 tornadoes in Oklahoma set the record for the most tornadoes ever recorded in the state in the month of February. In addition, there were 12 other non-tornado-related fatalities that occurred as a result of the storm system.[46]\nA mobile home that was destroyed by a high-end EF2 tornado near Kirby, Arkansas. Two minor injuries occurred at this location.\nIn early March, a powerful storm system brought widespread severe weather, including multiple tornadoes, across a large portion of the Eastern United States. On March 1, the Storm Prediction Center outlined an enhanced risk across areas in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee, including a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes.[47] In Shottsville, Alabama, a low-end EF1 tornado caused minor damage to a church, before downing trees and damaging the roof of a house elsewhere along the path. A stronger, but short-lived high-end EF1 tornado touched down in a subdivision near Hazel Green, Alabama, where a few homes sustained extensive damage and a vehicle was flipped onto its side. On March 2, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for the following day for parts of Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. A 15% hatched risk for tornadoes was in place across the Ark-La-Tex region, with the potential for strong tornadoes noted, although this was downgraded to a 10% hatched area due to lingering uncertainties about the convective modes that day. However, a 45% hatched area for wind damage was also in place in the same general area as well. A high-end EF2 tornado completely demolished two chicken houses and a mobile home, snapped many trees and power poles, partially unroofed a house, and injured five people near Kirby, Arkansas.[48] Several other tornadoes touched down throughout the threat area, though all were weak. This included an EF1 tornado that damaged numerous homes and a few businesses as it moved through the southeastern side of Shreveport, Louisiana, injuring two people. A high-end EF1 tornado also damaged multiple buildings as it impacted Pickton, Texas. On March 3, the storm system moved into the Ohio Valley region, where an EF2 tornado in the small community or Fremont, Kentucky, destroyed outbuildings, heavily damaged a church, and tore the roofs off of a few homes. In Vanderburgh County, Indiana, an EF1 tornado unroofed a church and damaged many homes and trees in the Saint Joseph community. Another EF1 tornado tracked from Duff to the northwestern part of Jasper, downing many trees, damaging or destroying a few barns, and inflicting roof and siding damage to homes. In Highland County, Ohio, an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage to homes and outbuildings in and around Pricetown, downed numerous trees and tree limbs, and tore much of the roof off a church elsewhere along its path. Farther south, two EF1 tornadoes in Alabama caused minor to moderate damage in and around Section and Rosalie. An EF1 tornado also downed many trees in and around Gray Court, South Carolina, some of which landed on houses. In addition to the tornadoes, the severe thunderstorms brought numerous reports of damaging straight-line winds and flooding. Overall, a total of 33 tornadoes were confirmed. While no tornado-related fatalities occurred, at least 13 non-tornado-related deaths occurred as a result of the storm system.[49][50]\nOn March 9, a strong tornado was caught on video from multiple angles as it impacted areas in and around several small towns and villages in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France, resulting in extensive damage. The tornado first badly damaged the roof of a school in Masbaraud-M\u00e9rignat before it moved to the northeast and struck Pontarion, where multiple homes and other structures had their roofs heavily damaged, and one house was completely unroofed. Vehicles in town were damaged by flying debris, trees and power poles were downed, a large masonry storage building was partially destroyed, and roof tiles and other projectiles were found driven into the exterior insulation layers of homes. The tornado also caused significant tree damage as it moved through wooded areas outside of Pontarion, snapping and uprooting many large trees, while multiple outbuildings were damaged or destroyed as well. Towards the end of the path, 17 homes sustained minor damage in the Le Donzeil area before the tornado dissipated. The tornado was rated F2 by the ESSL (European Severe Storms Laboratory) and the French Observatory of Tornadoes and Violent Thunderstorms (Keraunos).[51] Keraunos noted that the environment where the tornado formed was conducive for tornado development, as high instability and shear were present in France that day.[52][53]\nA large dusty tornado caused significant damage as it touched down near the outskirts of Taif, Saudi Arabia on March 13, resulting in one fatality. A few buildings sustained major damage, including loss of roofs and exterior walls. Power poles and iron fence posts were knocked over, while cars and trucks were thrown and severely damaged. A man was killed by flying debris, and at least one person was severely injured.[54][55]\nOn the morning of March 22, a high-end EF1 tornado impacted the Los Angeles suburb of Montebello, causing considerable damage. The tornado moved through an industrial area, where multiple warehouses had large sections of their roofs torn off. One warehouse sustained almost total collapse of its roof and had an HVAC unit ripped off. Signs were damaged or destroyed, windows were shattered, and numerous vehicles were damaged by flying debris. A power pole and some trees were downed, a semi-trailer was tipped over, and debris was scattered throughout the area. One person was injured. This was the strongest tornado to impact the Greater Los Angeles metro area since 1983.[56][57][58] The storm also brought 1.01 in (26 mm) of rain to Los Angeles, breaking a daily rainfall record.[59]\nA large and photogenic cone tornado struck Fazilka in India on March 24, resulting in significant damage. At least 50 unreinforced masonry homes were severely damaged or completely destroyed. Farming equipment was tossed, trees were snapped or uprooted, power poles were downed, and significant crop damage occurred in farm fields. No fatalities occurred, though at least 12 people were injured.[60][61][62]\nBeginning on March 24, a four-day severe weather and tornado outbreak impacted the Southeastern United States. The outbreak began in the morning with two EF1 tornadoes causing injuries in Texas before more significant tornadoes impacted Mississippi that night. One long-tracked and violent high-end EF4 tornado with windspeeds up to 195 mph prompted a tornado emergency for Rolling Fork and Silver City, causing major damage in both communities, with widespread and catastrophic damage occurring throughout much of Rolling Fork. A total of 17 people were killed by the Rolling Fork tornado. Another intense tornado from the same storm prompted another tornado emergency as it struck Winona; three people were killed by this EF3 tornado. Another destructive EF3 tornado from the same storm also caused major damage near or in the communities of Egypt, New Wren, and Amory, resulting in major damage and two fatalities. More tornadoes touched down in Alabama and Tennessee later that night and into the early morning hours of March 25, including an EF2 tornado that caused damage in Fayetteville, Tennessee, and another EF2 tornado that killed one person in Hartselle, Alabama, early on March 25.[63][64][65] From March 26 into March 27, the slow-moving storm system completely stalled out, and more severe weather occurred over the next two days as well, producing several additional tornadoes, including an EF3 tornado that struck just north of West Point, Georgia, on March 26, causing major damage to trees and houses and injuring five people. A total of 33 tornadoes were confirmed as a result of this outbreak, which killed 23 people and injured many others.\nLow-end EF4 damage to a home north of Keota, Iowa from a violent tornado.\nA large, widespread, and deadly tornado outbreak impacted large portions of the Midwestern, Southern, and Eastern United States. A high risk was issued for two areas in the Mississippi Valley on the morning of March 31; it was the first high risk issuance since March 25, 2021. That afternoon, a high-end EF3 wedge tornado passed through the Little Rock, Arkansas, metro area, prompting a tornado emergency as it inflicted significant damage to numerous structures. One person was killed by that tornado. Later, an intense high-end EF3 tornado caused severe damage near Martinsburg, Iowa. The same storm then produced a violent low-end EF4 tornado that destroyed multiple homes near Keota. The Iowa towns of Coralville, Hills, Mediapolis, and Charlotte all sustained significant damage after being impacted by EF2 tornadoes. EF2 tornadoes also caused severe damage in Sherman and Geneseo, Illinois, as well. Several other large tornadoes touched down throughout that afternoon and evening, including an EF3 tornado that killed four people in Wynne, Arkansas, and another EF3 tornado that killed a person in Covington, Tennessee. An EF1 tornado that struck Belvidere, Illinois, collapsed the roof of the Apollo Theatre, which was hosting a sold-out concert, resulting in one fatality and over 40 injuries.[66] Later, another destructive EF3 tornado killed six people when it struck Robinson, Illinois, and Sullivan, Indiana, before the cell traveled northwest, producing another EF3 tornado that destroyed homes, tossed cars and farm machinery, and killed two people near Spencer. The same supercell later spawned an EF3 tornado which directly impacted the town of Whiteland, where a warehouse and many homes were destroyed.[67] Another destructive and long-tracked EF3 tornado killed nine people in McNairy County, Tennessee, impacting the outskirts of Bethel Springs and Adamsville. A high-end EF3 tornado north of Hazel Green, Alabama, also destroyed homes and killed a person early on April 1. More severe weather occurred the next day along the eastern Great Lakes and East Coast, producing widespread damaging winds along with isolated hail and tornadoes. This included one destructive EF3 tornado that killed a person in Sussex County, Delaware. The tornado was the largest ever recorded in Delaware and only the second killer tornado and the second tornado rated F3/EF3 in the state since modern records began in 1950. Seven tornadoes also touched down in New Jersey, three of which reached EF2 intensity. In all, 147 tornadoes making it the 3rd largest tornado outbreak in recorded history, along with 26 tornadic fatalities, one indirect tornado-related fatality, and at least 211 injuries were confirmed as a result of this tornado outbreak. Six non-tornadic deaths also occurred during the outbreak.\nAnother severe weather and tornado outbreak affected the Midwestern United States, Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes in early April. On April 4, a moderate risk was issued by the SPC for parts of Illinois and Iowa, with a second moderate risk outlined for parts of Arkansas and Missouri. A 15% hatched risk area for tornadoes was in place for both moderate risk areas. Multiple tornadoes touched down throughout the afternoon and evening, including two EF1 tornadoes that touched down in the Quad Cities metro area, downing trees and damaging the roofs of homes in Rock Island and Moline, Illinois. Near Pleasantville, Iowa, a narrow and highly photogenic high-end EF1 tornado was caught on video by many storm chasers, and caused damage to homes and outbuildings. The most intense tornado of the event was a large high-end EF3 tornado that destroyed homes and injured four people near Lewistown, Illinois, before striking Bryant, causing significant damage in the small village. A storm chaser's vehicle was rolled by the tornado, though he was not injured.[68] A brief EF2 tornado ripped the roof off a gas station in Colona, while another EF2 tornado destroyed outbuildings and uplifted the roof of a house near Geneseo. A high-end EF1 tornado also caused damage to homes, garages, and trees in Table Grove. During the early morning hours of April 5, a nighttime high-end EF2 tornado struck the communities of Grassy and Glen Allen, Missouri, causing severe damage as multiple homes had their roofs torn off, a few of which sustained failure of exterior walls. Outbuildings and mobile homes were also obliterated by the tornado, with five people being killed in one of the mobile homes.[69][70][71] This became the deadliest tornado in Missouri since the 2011 Joplin tornado.[72]\nOn April 10, a few tornadoes occurred in the Mediterranean region of Europe. The most significant tornado touched down in the A\u011fa\u00e7\u00f6ren District of Aksaray Province in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey. It tracked through or near the villages of Camili, Av\u015far, K\u0131r\u0131mini and G\u00f6ll\u00fc along a 22 km-path (14 mi) with a maximum width of 200 m (220 yd). The tornado, which was rated F2, destroyed the roofs of homes, partially collapsed walls, and killed farm animals. Masonry outbuildings were destroyed, a tractor-trailer was overturned, while trees and power line pylons were downed as well. The minaret tower at the G\u00f6ll\u00fc mosque collapsed, injuring a 26-year-old man. A separate F1 tornado also struck areas in and around Budak, where another mosque also sustained collapse of its minaret tower, outbuildings were destroyed at dairy farms, and some homes had roof damage. In addition, a waterspout made landfall near Pizzo in Southern Italy, causing no damage.[80]\nOn April 15, a linear complex of severe thunderstorms with embedded circulations developed in Missouri and moved eastward through the St. Louis metro area, producing multiple tornadoes. A strong EF2 tornado destroyed a small house near Vichy, Missouri, heavily damaged metal airplane hangars at Rolla National Airport, and injured five people. An EF1 tornado moved through the St. Louis suburbs of Fenton and Sunset Hills, causing damage to homes, warehouses, and trees. The towns of Hillsboro, Festus, and Pevely were also directly hit by EF1 tornadoes, resulting in minor to moderate damage. Another EF1 tornado struck Belleville, Illinois, where homes, apartment buildings, and businesses had roofing blown off and large trees were snapped or uprooted, some of which landed on structures. Farther south, an isolated EF1 tornado caused damage to trees and homes near Ringgold, Louisiana. A total of 14 tornadoes were confirmed, and numerous reports of damaging straight-line winds were received as well.[8][81] The National Centers for Environmental Information documented that this storm system caused $1.1 billion (2023 USD) in damage.[79] The line of storms also forced the Kansas City Royals to postpone a baseball game against the Atlanta Braves.[82]\nA tornado struck areas near the large city of Linyi, Shandong Province, with significant damage observed in the Tancheng County village of Lizhuangzhen. The tornado was captured on video from multiple angles, some from close range. Homes and other structures were severely damaged, including some that sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls, while tractors and cars were tossed. Metal truss transmission towers, power poles, and masonry fences were toppled over, and outbuilding structures were destroyed as well. Trees were snapped, and several people were injured. Another tornado was reported in northern Shandong Province as well. Neither of the tornadoes were officially rated.[83][84][85][86]\nA large high-end EF3 tornado that caused severe damage in and around Cole, Oklahoma.\nOn April 19, a tornado outbreak impacted areas in the southern Great Plains. In Oklahoma, 18 tornadoes touched down and moved erratically near the southern and eastern outskirts of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Several of the tornadoes were strong, and most of them were produced by a large, slow-moving supercell that moved east-northeastward.[87][88] A large high-end EF3 tornado impacted the community of Cole, heavily damaging or destroying homes, mobile homes, and other structures, resulting in a fatality. An indirect fatality from the tornado was also confirmed.[89][90][91][92][93][94] The supercell also produced multiple weak tornadoes and two large, high-end EF2 tornadoes that caused significant damage near Etowah,[95] before merging with another tornadic supercell to its west. This cluster of storms spawned a large, broad mesocyclone that produced several circulations that rotated around each other due to the Fujiwhara effect.[95][96] These circulations produced multiple erratic-moving strong tornadoes after sunset, including EF3 and EF2 tornadoes south and north of Pink respectively, and a very large, high-end EF2 tornado that struck Shawnee, where numerous homes and other buildings sustained extensive damage or were destroyed, including buildings at Oklahoma Baptist University and Shawnee High School. A news-gathering Bell 206 B3 JetRanger helicopter operated by Tulsa television station KOTV was damaged at the Shawnee Regional Airport, along with several hangars.[97][98][99][100]\nFurther north, a supercell produced a series of eight tornadoes in Chase County, Kansas, near Strong City, including an EF0 tornado that overturned a semi-truck near Elmdale, causing an injury. Two EF2 tornadoes near Strong City caused major damage to outbuildings, silos, power poles, and trees, while an EF0 tornado caused minor tree damage in the northern part of town. An EF1 tornado caused minor to moderate damage as it moved through Cottonwood Falls, and another EF0 tornado injured a person in a vehicle near Saffordville. Three EFU tornadoes were also confirmed in Iowa.[101] Another round of severe weather occurred the next day from southern Wisconsin to South Texas, including three weak tornadoes in Illinois and Texas, and hail in Illinois up to 3.00 in (7.6 cm) wide.[102][103] Federal disaster assistance was requested in Oklahoma following the tornado outbreak.

An EF0 tornado in Mooresville, North Carolina, caused minor tree, fence, and house damage. Another EF0 tornado touched down in Poolesville, Maryland, where minor tree and structure damage occurred. The town of Womelsdorf, Pennsylvania, was struck by an EF1 tornado, which snapped trees and power poles, damaged a few structures and vehicles, and flipped a set of metal bleachers. The most significant tornado of the event was an EF2 tornado that produced its most intense damage in rural forested areas north of Jeffersonville, New York, where a metal truss transmission tower was collapsed, garages and barns were heavily damaged or destroyed, and many large hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. The tornado unroofed a couple of buildings in Roscoe and Rockland shortly before it dissipated. Two children were killed in Pennsylvania as a result of trees that were blown over by straight-line winds. The next day, a daily record of 3.13 in (80 mm) of rain fell in Hartford, Connecticut.[108] The rainfall total in Central Park was 2.14 in (54 mm).[109] A total of eight tornadoes were confirmed.[8][110]\nOn April 22, a tornado was caught on video by local residents as it struck Jalan Bani Bu Ali in Ash Sharqiyah South Governorate in eastern Oman. The tornado damaged many homes, killed farm animals, and injured a woman. The storm system that spawned the tornado also resulted in torrential rainfall and flash flooding. On the following day, Jalan Bani Bu Ali was hit by another tornado.[111][112]\nIn late April, a slow-moving weather system produced scattered tornadoes in the Southern and Eastern United States throughout a four-day period. On April 27, the Storm Prediction Center issued a slight risk of severe weather for the Gulf Coast region, including a 5% risk of tornadoes. A strong EF2 tornado struck the small town of Hosford, Florida, downing many trees and inflicting major damage to a few homes.

On April 29, the Storm Prediction Center issued a slight risk of severe weather for most of Florida and southeast Georgia, including a 5% risk area for tornadoes. A MCS off the coast of Florida produced damaging straight-line winds and heavy rain throughout the day. In Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, a high-end EF2 tornado a partially unroofed an apartment building, largely destroyed a manufactured home, heavily damaged a dry-cleaning business, and downed many trees and large metal light poles. Along US 1, the tornado was caught on video as it flipped and tossed cars. During the early morning hours of April 30, a high-end EF1 tornado destroyed a metal storage building in rural Charlotte County, Florida. Later in the afternoon, clusters of severe storms affected South Carolina, eastern North Carolina and the Hampton Roads area in Virginia. One embedded supercell made its way into the northern sections of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and produced an intense EF3 tornado that touched down in residential areas of the city, snapping or uprooting trees, overturning vehicles, and causing significant structural damage. Multiple large and well-built homes had their roofs torn off and suffered collapse of their top floor exterior walls. The tornado then struck Fort Story, where buildings sustained less intense damage before the tornado moved out into the Atlantic Ocean. Numerous videos and photographs taken by Virginia Beach residents showed a \"stovepipe\" tornado with an audible roar. In addition to tornadoes, flash flooding affected the entire East Coast on April 30.[113] A total of 12 tornadoes were confirmed.[8]\nAn F2 rated tornado struck Sultan Alaaddin, Akarca and \u00d6ren districts of the city of Anamur. Around 100 greenhouses were damaged along with windows and roofs of some houses and workplaces. Thirteen people were slightly injured.[116]\nEarly on May 6, a line of severe storms pushed through southern Louisiana, producing damaging winds. One low-end EF1 tornado near Morse damaged several homes, destroyed outbuildings, and injured one person.[117] Later that day, a severe weather outbreak impacted the Central United States. Multiple brief landspouts touched down in Nebraska and South Dakota but no damage occurred. Tornadoes also touched down in Minnesota, including some that caused some damage. In Missouri, a lone supercell thunderstorm produced multiple tornadoes, including one high-end EF0 tornado that damaged the roofs of several homes and a church in Trenton, as well as a high-end EF2 tornado north of Linneus that damaged or destroyed several homes and outbuildings. The next morning, an EF1 tornado struck the Indiana University Southeast campus near New Albany, Indiana, injuring two people.[8][118] An Eras Tour concert in Nashville was delayed multiple hours due to severe storms in the area.[119] Damage from the tornado outbreak totaled $1.1 billion.[79]\nA grain bin that was destroyed northwest of Oakland, Nebraska by an EF2 tornado.\nBetween May 10 and May 13, a tornado outbreak affected the Great Plains. Over two dozen tornado reports from the Great Plains and Gulf Coast came into the Storm Prediction Center on May 11, although all the tornadoes that touched down were either weak or not ratable.[120] The storm system also resulted in Denver recording their 8th wettest day on record,[121] with hail forcing a ground stop at Denver International Airport.[122]Amtrak's northbound Heartland Flyer was delayed for almost three hours that day due severe warnings north of its station stop in Purcell, Oklahoma, including one warning for an EF1 tornado that struck Noble just southeast of Norman.[123] A large tornado outbreak affected Nebraska the next day. Numerous tornadoes touched down, including a multi-vortex EF1 tornado near Spalding that was captured on video by multiple storm chasers. A large rain wrapped EF2 tornado was also spotted near Uehling with two injuries and widespread damage being reported from the storm. Other tornado touchdowns were also reported near Oakland and Lyons[124][125][126] and other tornadoes were reported in Kansas and Oklahoma as well.[126] Early the next morning on May 13, a high-end EF1 tornado struck Laguna Heights, Texas, where emergency management confirmed one fatality and multiple injuries as well as extensive property damage.[127][128] More tornadoes touched down later that afternoon across Iowa and Illinois.[129][130] Damage occurred near Harvey, Pomeroy, and Knoxville, Iowa.

Damage from the tornado outbreak totaled $2.4 billion.[79]\nMultiple rounds of severe and tornadic thunderstorms impacted a large portion of the South, Midwest, and Great Plains in the middle of June. On June 14, multiple severe thunderstorm watches and tornado watches were issued from the Ark-La-Tex region to northern Florida.[138] A large EF2 tornado moved between Blakely and Arlington, Georgia, knocking down power lines and trees and severely damaging a home, injuring the residents inside.[139] More tornadoes were reported later that afternoon and evening across Alabama and Georgia while an EF2 tornado caused major damage in Cass County, Texas.[140] There were also over 300 reports of large hail and damaging winds, including wind gusts reaching as high as 82 mph (132 km/h) and hail up to 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter in Mississippi.[141] On June 15, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for severe weather across much of Oklahoma, along with a small part of Texas and Kansas. The risk was driven by 45% hatched areas for both large hail and damaging winds. A small 10% area for tornadoes covering the eastern part of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles as well as all of Southwestern Oklahoma was also present.[142] That afternoon, multiple rounds of intense supercells formed across this region and pushed eastward. One of the cells produced a destructive and deadly low-end EF3 tornado that tracked through Perryton, Texas, causing significant damage to a mobile home park and destroying multiple downtown and industrial buildings, killing at least three people, and injuring about 100 others.[143][144] Other tornadoes were confirmed in Oklahoma and Texas along with swath of wind and hail damage. Supercell thunderstorms also developed along the western part of Lake Erie and moved southeastward, spawning several tornadoes, including three that were rated EF2. One of these tornadoes caused considerable damage in the Point Place neighborhood in Toledo, Ohio.[145] Severe weather also continued to impact the Gulf Coast and Southeastern United States into the early morning hours of June 16, where many instances of damaging winds and large hail were reported along with isolated tornadoes.[146] Flash flooding in Pensacola, Florida, resulted from 9.23 in (234 mm) of rain in five hours, and strong winds blew a tree into a house, killing one person. The flooding triggered a flash flood emergency.[147] A couple of weak tornadoes touched down in the Delaware Valley while more weak tornadoes touched down in Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Virginia. By June 16, the storms had left 664,000 customers without power along the Gulf Coast.[148]\nMore rounds of severe storms occurred on June 17, including a powerful MCS that pushed through Northern and Central Oklahoma. Both the Oklahoma City and Tulsa metropolitan areas had widespread wind damage with the latter metropolitan area seeing wind gusts of up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) and multiple weak tornadoes. On June 18, more tornadoes were confirmed in Florida and Mississippi, including an EF3 tornado which caused significant damage in Louin, Mississippi, where at least one fatality and 20 injuries occurred.[149][150] Scattered tornadoes occurred across the Southeast on June 19 as well, including an EF2 tornado that injured six people in Moss Point, Mississippi. Overall, 87 tornadoes were confirmed during this outbreak sequence.[151]\nA violent EF4 tornado, estimated at 620 m (680 yd) wide, struck Mountain View County, Alberta, Canada, at 1:45 p.m. MDT (19:45 UTC). Areas between Didsbury and Carstairs were hit hardest before the tornado crossed Highway 2. Three homes were destroyed, four were rendered uninhabitable, and five were damaged.[160] One person was injured by debris while sheltering in the basement of her collapsing home, but no fatalities occurred. Tree branches were snapped, power lines were downed, and one gas leak occurred at a destroyed home. Twenty-five cows, twenty chickens, and one horse were also killed.[161] Significant ground scouring occurred near Didsbury.[162] The joint damage survey from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), Prairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Centre (PASPC), and the Northern Tornadoes Project (NTP) assigned a maximum rating of low-end EF4 based on one well-built home being completely destroyed, with peak wind speeds estimated at 275 km/h (171 mph). Near this home, a 22,000 lb (10,000 kg) combine was thrown 50 m (160 ft) before being rolled a further 50 to 100 m (160 to 330 ft). This was only the third violent tornado in Alberta history, after the 1987 Edmonton tornado and the 1915 Grassy Lake tornado (also known as the Redcliff Cyclone).[160]\nA long-tracked storm struck Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, causing severe damage along a path of about 112 kilometres (70 mi). The storm produced at least one tornado, most likely a tornado family during this long track. At least EF2 vegetation damage was documented, with the most severe damage noted in the town of Sede Nova, which was struck by a tornado.[163]\nA high-end EF1 tornado touched down in Aguada, Puerto Rico, partially tearing the roof off of one home causing significant interior damage. Another home lost its roof covering material and metal siding. Numerous trees were uprooted and snapped. Peak wind speeds were estimated at 110 mph (180 km/h).[172]\nRadar scan of the storm as it produced the Dortches tornado: a hook echo is visible on the top left, and a debris signature on the bottom left\nAn intense multiple-vortex tornado touched down southwest of Dortches, North Carolina, leaving power poles bent and trees snapped. The tornado then crossed I-95, producing widespread tree damage and shutting down parts of the highway for several hours.[174] As it moved into the city limits of Dortches itself, it strengthened to high-end EF2 intensity, destroying multiple single-wide mobile homes and snapping power poles. The tornado then reached the north side of Rocky Mount after continuing to travel east-northeast, in which it encountered a residential building and collapsed every exterior wall. The tornado later advanced into Belmont Lake Golf Club, where it strengthened to mid-range EF3 intensity. The tornado collapsed a metal transmission tower and caused significant damage to a Pfizer warehouse facility, flipping and destroying nearby semi-trailer trucks. The tornado then weakened slightly as it crossed into Edgecombe County before lifting east of Battleboro.[175]\nThe tornado's peak estimated wind speeds were 150 mph (240 km/h), with a peak width of 600 yards (550 m) and a total path length of 16.5 miles (26.6 km).[175] It caused sixteen injuries, two of them resulting in hospitalization, but no fatalities. 38 homes were damaged. The National Weather Service office in Raleigh did not issue a tornado warning for the storm until the tornado had already been down for six minutes, resulting in scrutiny from some meteorologists on social media, but the National Weather Service defended the warning process and noted that the eventual warning came before the tornado dealt its most significant damage.[176] After law enforcement reported that up to 50,000 pallets of medicine had been damaged at the Pfizer facility, Erin Fox of the University of Utah Health said the damage could lead to shortages of certain drugs while the company deals with the situation.[177]FDA Commissioner Robert Califf later announced that, since hospitals already had the drugs or the drugs were on their way, no significant supply impacts were expected. Pfizer said as the tornado had damaged storage areas but not production equipment, any shortages would be less serious.[178] The tornado caused over $300 million (2023 USD) in damage.[179]\nA strong tornado tracked 14 km in and around Alfonsine, Emilia Romagna, injuring 14 people. Steel power trusses were bent at the base, cars and trucks were moved, heavy damage occurred to crops of various types, trees were snapped or uprooted, objects were lofted for hundreds of meters, and some buildings (partially) collapsed. The tornado was rated IF3 on the International Fujita scale by the European Severe Storms Laboratory.[180]\nA rare tornado touched down in Ilirska Bistrica, Slovenia, damaging houses and felling trees. The tornado, which was rated F1/T3, was associated with an isolated supercell storm. Tornadoes are exceedingly rare in Slovenia and neighboring countries except for Italy. The nearest official weather station, Koseze, reported 107 km/h (30 m/s; 66 mph) winds some distance from the tornado's path.[181] Another tornado had occurred earlier near Jesolo, Italy.[182] The region had been the site of uncommonly severe storm systems throughout June and July 2023.\nA deadly EF2 tornado struck parts of Yancheng City, Jiangsu. Approximately 283 residences were damaged or destroyed, two people were reported to have been killed, and at least 15 people were injured.[188][189][190]\nThe tornado debris signature from the Webberville, Michigan EF2 tornado, which extended to about 25,000 feet (7,600 m) in height.\nA severe weather and tornado outbreak occurred across parts of the Great Lakes region and southwestern Ontario during the evening hours of August 24, including in the Grand Rapids and Webberville, Michigan areas, as well as in Metro Detroit. Near Webberville, an EF2 tornado prompted a PDS tornado warning, flipping cars and trapping people in their vehicles on I-96, resulting in one fatality and three injuries.[195][196] Roofs and buildings collapsed across Kent County due to a high-end EF1 tornado that moved through portions of the county.[197] An EF2 tornado also struck Fayette County, Pennsylvania early on August 25 as well.[198] In Ontario, two tornadoes occurred simultaneously and moved southeastward in the Windsor area.[199] The first one was an EF0 tornado that moved through the west side of Windsor, downing numerous trees and branches, removing roof shingles from homes, and damaging fences.[200] To the east, an EF1 tornado collapsed barns, snapped power poles, damaged grain bins, downed trees and branches down, and removed roof shingles from numerous homes as it passed east of Tecumseh and struck Elmstead before dissipating northeast of Pleasant Park.[201] Severe flooding and damaging winds also affected much of the region and three deaths occurred after a weather-related vehicle accident.[195] Another person was killed in Michigan when a tree fell on a home in Lansing.[202] The storms also resulted in over 700,000 customers losing power in the Great Lakes area,[203] while another 20,000 customers lost power in Ontario.[199] Between the two nations, estimated economic losses reached $880 million.[204]\nOn September 17, three tornadoes impacted France and the United Kingdom. A brief landspout struck S\u00e9reilhac in R\u00e9gion Limousin. [205] Around the same time, a significant tornado struck in Mayenne, France, causing damage to or destroying structures, trees, and concrete utility poles were bent. The French Observatory of Tornadoes and Violent Thunderstorms (Keraunos) rated the tornado EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds estimated between 175 to 225 kilometres per hour (109 to 140 mph).[206] The European Severe Storms Laboratory rated the tornado IF2 on the International Fujita scale. In the late evening, a waterspout made landfall on West Beach before tracking through the western and northern suburbs of Littlehampton and then the communities of Wick and Lyminster. This tornado toppled several trees, smashing at least 20 car windows and those of multiple houses. One person sustained minor leg injuries. On September 18, the Met Office noted that \"conditions weren't unfavourable\" for a small tornado.[207][208] On September 19, a TORRO site investigator confirmed the event as a tornado. A preliminary analysis suggested the majority of the damage warranted a T1 rating, with a peak of T2.[209]\nA significant tornado impacted the community of Gr\u00f8nh\u00f8j Strand in Jammerbugt Municipality. The tornado picked up a mobile home and threw it 20 metres. Other mobile homes and caravans were overturned or moved and a shed was destroyed. According to the ESSL, the tornado had a track length of 1.2 km, had a maximum path width of 100 metres, and had a maximum intensity of IF2.[210]\nTwo tornadoes moved directly into the city of Suqian, Jiangsu, killing five people and injuring another four.[211] Approximately 1,600 houses were either damaged or completely destroyed. Another tornado struck parts of Funing, Jiangsu, also causing five deaths and four minor injuries.[212] The two tornadoes in Suqian were rated EF2, while the tornado in Funing received an EF3 rating.[213][214]\nSevere thunderstorms spawned at least one tornado in western Germany, which affected the towns of Nusbaum and M\u00fclbach. Severe damage to roofs and trees was reported, and the tornado has been given a preliminary IF2 rating by the ESSL.[215]\nA strong tornado developed in southern Brazil, affecting the city of Cascavel, Paran\u00e1. Roofs and trees suffered significant damage and a building was completely destroyed. The tornado has been given a F2 rating by SIMEPAR.[216]\nA large storm system moved through Florida, spawning several tornadoes. In the early morning hours of October 12, a waterspout offshore of Clearwater Beach moved northeast and made landfall in Dunedin, partially tearing the roof off of an apartment building and earning a low-end EF2 rating. Soon after, another strong EF2 tornado moved through Crystal River, tearing the roof off of one home and collapsing an exterior wall. Later in the morning, another low-end EF2 tornado touched down in Palm Coast, unroofing one home and flipping a car. Four other EF0 tornadoes were also confirmed during this event.[8]\nFor the second time in just over a month, another tornado struck the town of Littlehampton. Several trees were snapped, fence panels were destroyed, power lines were brought down, car windows were smashed, and one house had its entire roof ripped off. On October 29, a TORRO site investigator visited the site where the event happened and confirmed that the weather event was a tornado. Additionally, they have provisionally rated the tornado T4 on the TORRO scale, which is equivalent to a low-end F2 tornado.[217] The European severe weather database rated the tornado IF2 on the International Fujita scale. [218]\nA significant tornado touched down in Jersey, United Kingdom, on the evening of November 1 into the morning of November 2. One house had its entire roof ripped off and upper story walls destroyed.[219][220] The tornado was rated IF2.5 by the European Severe Storms Laboratory on the new International Fujita scale (IF-scale).[221] On November 6, TORRO released a statement that rated the tornado T6 on the TORRO scale, which is equivalent to a low-end F3 tornado. [222] On the morning of November 2, another tornado was confirmed in Sompting and northern Lancing in West Sussex. According to TORRO after looking at the damage caused and reports from the public, the tornado\u2019s track was mapped and the tornado was rated a T2 on the TORRO scale. Later that same day, an IF1 rated tornado struck parts of Castel Focognano in Italy, damaging roofs and trees. On November 4, an intense tornado struck Lavino in Bulgaria. According to the European Severe Storms Laboratory, at least 150 structures were damaged and one person was slightly injured, earning a rating of IF3. About half an hour later, a significant tornado struck X\u00e1nthi, Greece. A large tree branch fell on a moving bus, causing no injuries. Length of the damage path reached at least 1.5 km (between Geor. Kondyli street and EPS stadiums). This tornado was rated IF2. [221] Additionally, an unrated tornado struck parts of Sratsimir, Bulgaria, an IF1.5 tornado struck parts of Derek\u00f6y, Turkey, and an IF1 tornado struck parts of La Pou\u00ebze, France.

        "question": "How many books has Colleen Hoover published?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Hoover#Books",
        "context": "\nColleen Hoover (born Margaret Colleen Fennell; December 11, 1979) is an American author who primarily writes novels in the romance and young adult fiction genres.[2][1] She is best known for her 2016 romance novel It Ends with Us. Many of her works were self-published before being picked up by a publishing house.[2][3] As of October 2022, Hoover has sold approximately 20 million books.[4] She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2023.[5]\nIn November 2011, Hoover began writing her debut novel, Slammed, with no intention of getting published. She was inspired by a lyric, \"decide what to be and go be it,\u201d from an Avett Brothers song, \"Head Full of Doubt/Road Full of Promise,\" and she incorporated Avett Brothers lyrics throughout the story.[13] Hoover self-published Slammed in January 2012.[11] She states that she published the novel so her mother, who had just received an Amazon Kindle, could read it.[14] A sequel, Point of Retreat, was published in February 2012.[11] After a few months, Slammed was reviewed and given five stars by book blogger Maryse Black,[15] and afterward, sales rapidly rocketed for Hoover's first two books.[11][16]Slammed and Point of Retreat reached #8 and #18, respectively, on the New York Times Best Seller list in August of that year.[17][18]Atria Books picked up the novels and republished them on August 10, 2012.[19] A third book in the series, This Girl, was published in April 2013.[20][21] After the success of Slammed, Hoover quit her job in social work to become a full-time writer.[14]\nHoover's novel Hopeless was self-published in December 2012, and features a girl who was home-schooled throughout her elementary education before going to a public high school.[11] The book reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list on January 20,[2][3] and remained there for three weeks.[22] It was the first self-published novel to ever top the list.[23] A companion novel, Losing Hope, was published that July.[24]\nFinding Cinderella is a free novella that Hoover published in 2014. It features several of the characters depicted in her novels Hopeless and Losing Hope. A paperback was released with several bonus features, such as a new epilogue and Hoover's own \"Cinderella story\".[25]Maybe Someday, published in March 2014, was the first novel of a small series about a boy and a girl who write music together and fall in love. Musician Griffin Peterson created a soundtrack to accompany the novel.[26] Links in the e-book or a scannable QR code in the paperback led to a website where readers could listen to the music.[27]\nNever Never, a 2015 collaboration with Tarryn Fisher, was originally split into three parts and sold as three separate books. The work was later republished as one complete book.[citation needed]\nHoover's novel It Ends with Us was published in 2016.[28] Hoover described it as \"the hardest book I've ever written.\"[29] The novel concerns domestic violence, and, according to Hoover, it was written with the intention of advocating for domestic violence victims.[30] The story was inspired by Hoover's personal experience as a child growing up in a household with domestic violence, which carried through into her adult life. The book's main character, Lily, experiences domestic violence at a young age, witnessing her father's abuse towards her mother, on top of experiencing it firsthand, and then she ends up in a violent relationship as an adult.[31] As of 2019, the novel had sold over a million copies worldwide, and it has been translated into over twenty languages.[32] In 2021, Hoover experienced a surge in popularity due to attention from the #BookTok community on TikTok.[33][34] As a result, in January 2022, It Ends with Us was #1 on The New York Times Best Sellers list.[35] Filming of a movie adaptation of It Ends with Us began in May 2023.[36]\nA sequel to It Ends with Us, titled It Starts with Us, was published on October 18, 2022 by Atria Books.[37]Simon & Schuster released the details of the extensive marketing campaign for the novel, which became the publisher's most-preordered book of all time.[38]\nIn October 2022, Simon & Schuster UK acquired two standalone novels by Hoover, which are to be published in 2024 and 2026.[39]\nAs of October 2022, Hoover has sold more than 20 million books.[4] Reflecting on Hoover's success in 2022, Alexandra Alter of The New York Times wrote, \"To say she\u2019s currently the best-selling novelist in the United States, to even compare her to other successful authors who have landed several books on the best seller lists, fails to capture the size and loyalty of her audience.\"[4] Hoover's work has been criticized for normalizing abuse.[40]",

        "question": "Where will the upcoming International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) be hosted?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad#Summary:~:text=65-,Bath,July%2011%E2%80%9322,-%5B63%5D%5B64",
        "context": "\nThe International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is a mathematical olympiad for pre-university students, and is the oldest of the International Science Olympiads.[1] It is \u201cthe most prestigious\u201d mathematical competition in the world. The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. It has since been held annually, except in 1980. More than 100 countries participate. Each country sends a team of up to six students,[2] plus one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.[3]\nThe content ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems in branches of mathematics not conventionally covered in secondary or high school and often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations, combinatorics, and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, as there is a principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity, often times a great deal of ingenuity to net all points for a given IMO problem.\nThe selection process differs by country, but it often consists of a series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing test. Awards are given to approximately the top-scoring 50% of the individual contestants. Teams are not officially recognized\u2014all scores are given only to individual contestants, but team scoring is unofficially compared more than individual scores.[4] Contestants must be under the age of 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution. Subject to these conditions, an individual may participate any number of times in the IMO.[5]\nThe first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. Since then it has been held every year (except in 1980, when it was cancelled due to internal strife in Mongolia)[6] It was initially founded for eastern European member countries of the Warsaw Pact, under the USSR bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as well.[2] Because of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in eastern European countries, and gradually spread to other nations.[7]\nSources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders and students are generally housed at different locations, and partly because after the competition the students were sometimes based in multiple cities for the rest of the IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.[8]\nThe competition consists of 6 problems. The competition is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. Each problem is worth 7 points for a maximum total score of 42 points. Calculators are not allowed. The problems chosen are from various areas of secondary school mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often elementary. However, they are usually disguised so as to make the solutions difficult. The problems given in the IMO are largely designed to require creativity and the ability to solve problems quickly. Thus, the prominently featured problems are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years, the latter has not been as popular as before because of the algorithmic use of theorems like Muirhead's Inequality, and Complex/Analytic Bash to solve problems.[10]\nEach participating country, other than the host country, may submit suggested problems to a Problem Selection Committee provided by the host country, which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlist. The team leaders arrive at the IMO a few days in advance of the contestants and form the IMO Jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest, starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist. The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6, where the First day problems Q1, Q2, and Q3 are in increasing difficulty, and the Second day problems Q4, Q5, Q6 are in increasing difficulty. The Team Leaders of all countries are given the problems in advance of the contestants, and thus, are kept strictly separated and observed.[11]\nEach country's marks are agreed between that country's leader and deputy leader and coordinators provided by the host country (the leader of the team whose country submitted the problem in the case of the marks of the host country), subject to the decisions of the chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved.[12]\nIn countries of the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, a team has in the past been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries.[16]\nThe participants are ranked based on their individual scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly fewer than half of them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver, or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. Participants who do not win a medal but who score 7 points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention.[17]\nSpecial prizes may be awarded for solutions of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem. This last happened in 1995 (Nikolay Nikolov, Bulgaria) and 2005 (Iurie Boreico), but was more frequent up to the early 1980s.[18] The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico, a student from Moldova, for his solution to Problem 3, a three variable inequality.\nThe rule that at most half the contestants win a medal is sometimes broken if it would cause the total number of medals to deviate too much from half the number of contestants. This last happened in 2010 (when the choice was to give either 226 (43.71%) or 266 (51.45%) of the 517 contestants (excluding the 6 from North Korea \u2014 see below) a medal),[19] 2012 (when the choice was to give either 226 (41.24%) or 277 (50.55%) of the 548 contestants a medal), and 2013, when the choice was to give either 249 (47.16%) or 278 (52.65%) of the 528 contestants a medal. In these cases, slightly more than half the contestants were awarded a medal.[20][21]\nThe four perfect scorers in the 2001 IMO. From left to right: Gabriel Carroll, Reid Barton (both United States), Liang Xiao and Zhiqiang Zhang (both China).The Bangladesh team at the 2009 IMOSerbia's team for the 2010 IMOZhuo Qun (Alex) Song (Canadian), the most highly decorated IMO contestant with 5 golds and 1 bronze medalMaryam Mirzakhani (Iran), the first woman to be honored with a Fields Medal, won 2 gold medals in 1994 and 1995, getting a perfect score in the second year.\nThe only countries to have their entire team score perfectly in the IMO were the United States in 1994 (they were coached by Paul Zeitz), China in 2022, and Luxembourg, whose 1-member team had a perfect score in 1981. The US's success earned a mention in TIME Magazine.[80] Hungary won IMO 1975 in an unorthodox way when none of the eight team members received a gold medal (five silver, three bronze).[72] Second place team East Germany also did not have a single gold medal winner (four silver, four bronze).[78]\nSeveral individuals have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: Zhuo Qun Song (Canada) is the most highly decorated participant[81] with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal.[82]Reid Barton (United States) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998\u20132001).[83] Barton is also one of only eight four-time Putnam Fellows (2001\u201304). Christian Reiher (Germany), Lisa Sauermann (Germany), Teodor von Burg (Serbia), Nipun Pitimanaaree (Thailand) and Luke Robitaille (United States) are the only other participants to have won four gold medals (2000\u201303, 2008\u201311, 2009\u201312, 2010\u201313, 2011\u201314, and 2019\u201322 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009).[84] Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin H\u00e4rterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold.[2]Ciprian Manolescu (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than anybody else in the history of the competition, doing it all three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997).[85] Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000).[86]Eugenia Malinnikova (Soviet Union) is the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history. She has 3 gold medals in IMO 1989 (41 points), IMO 1990 (42) and IMO 1991 (42), missing only 1 point in 1989 to precede Manolescu's achievement.[87]\nTerence Tao (Australia) participated in IMO 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning bronze, silver and gold medals respectively. He won a gold medal when he just turned thirteen in IMO 1988, becoming the youngest person[88] to receive a gold medal (Zhuo Qun Song of Canada also won a gold medal at age 13, in 2011, though he was older than Tao). Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist with his 1986 bronze medal, followed by 2009 bronze medalist Ra\u00fal Ch\u00e1vez Sarmiento (Peru), at the age of 10 and 11 respectively.[89] Representing the United States, Noam Elkies won a gold medal with a perfect paper at the age of 14 in 1981. Both Elkies and Tao could have participated in the IMO multiple times following their success, but entered university and therefore became ineligible.\nOver the years, since its inception to present, the IMO has attracted far more male contestants than female contestants.[91][92][93] During the period 2000\u20132021, there were only 1,102 female contestants (9.2%) out of a total of 11,950 contestants. The gap is even more significant in terms of IMO gold medallists; from 1959 to 2021, there were 43 female and 1295 male gold medal winners.[94]\n^IMO 2021 was originally to be held in Washington D.C., US, but the US was forced to give up hosting soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused funding problems. Russia agreed to host for the second time in a row.[60]",

Based on the original The Voice of Holland and part of the Voice franchise, it has aired 23 seasons and aims to find unsigned singing talent (solo or duets, professional and amateur) contested by aspiring singers drawn from public auditions. Singers must be at least thirteen years of age to compete.[2]\nEach season begins with the \"Blind Auditions\", where coaches form their team of artists whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The number of artists varies per season, with a set range between 8 and 16 artists. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read \"I want you.\" At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects their coach if more than one coach expresses interest.[6] Introduced in the 14th season is \"Block\", which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestant.\nIn the \"Battle Rounds\", each coach pairs two of their team members to perform together, then chooses one to advance in the competition. Each coach are assisted by different celebrity advisors varies each season. In season one, coaches sit alongside their respective advisors in the battle stage; however, the advisors no longer join the coaches in the battle stage starting season two. In season 23, there are no advisors and its coach assumed the duties for advising the artists alone. Season three introduced \"steals\", allowing each coach to save/select individuals who were eliminated during a battle round by another coach. First seen in the eighth season, artists are either given a walkover or is reassigned to a three-way battle in the event of another artist withdrawing from the competition if each coach sees fit. Saves were also added starting Season 14, which lets a coach prevent someone that they eliminated on their team from going home; in Season 23, Saves are replaced with \"Playoff Pass\" (based on the Battle Pass from the Australian version) which allow one artist to exempt them from participating in the Knockouts and directly advance to the Playoffs (the other artist advancing to the Knockouts as usual).\nThe Knockout Rounds were also introduced in season three (except for seasons six and sixteen). A pair of artists within a team are selected to sing individual performances in succession. They are not told until a few minutes prior to their performances who their partner is. The artists get to choose their own songs in this round, although they continue to get help and advice from their respective coaches, and since season six, a celebrity advisor serving as a mega mentor (except seasons 14 and 22). At the conclusion of the performances, coaches would decide which one of each pair gets to advance to the next round.[6] Similar to the battle rounds, the coaches can steal one eliminated artist from another coach starting with season five. Starting in season 14, coaches can save one eliminated artist from their own team. From season 18 till 20, artists who were saved faced a Four-Way Knockout, with the winner decided through a public vote.[7]\nThe \"Battles, Round 2\" were introduced to replace the Knockout Rounds in season six.[6] Similar to the Knockout Rounds, each singer is paired within their team. One celebrity key adviser also assists all four of the coaches and their teams in preparation of these rounds. Coaches give each Battle pairing a list of songs and each pair must agree on which song to sing.[8] Like the first Battle round, each coach can still decide which of their singers in each pair will advance to the next round, and also allowed one steal.[9]\nIn the sixteenth season, the knockouts were replaced by The Live Cross Battles, a format identical to the Cross Battles from the Chinese version of The Voice. Each coach selects an artist to perform with another coach's artist together. The artist that receives the public vote will move on to the Playoffs, while the losing artist may be eliminated from the competition. The Live Cross Battles did not return in season seventeen due to poor reception.[10]\nPreviously eliminated artists can also advance to compete in the live shows; between seasons nine and thirteen (except season 11), each coach saved one artist (from either the Battle or Knockout rounds) to put through to the Live Playoffs. For seasons 15, 16 and 20, selected singers (prior to the Live elimination rounds) are put through to the \"Comeback Stage\" (which would be mentored by a fifth coach) and competed in a series of duels for a place in the live shows, with the winner earning a right to join a team of their choice. Season 21 added \"Voice Comeback\" where each coach picked one artist to compete in a Twitter poll, and only one artist with the most votes moves on.\nIn the final live performance phase of the competition (playoffs and elimination rounds), artists perform in weekly shows, where public voting narrows to a final group of artists and eventually declares a winner.[6]\nUnder the current format since season three in favor on a more competitive standard previously seen on other similar reality shows, any artists, regardless of each team, who earned the lowest number of votes were progressively eliminated each week until five artists remain (three until season 6, then four prior to season 17), hence introducing a possibility where at least one coach would not represent a single artist in the finale.\nPrior to season three, the coaches have the power to save one artist that had not received the public's vote that week, and as of season two, \"last chance performance\" are added where artists performed an additional song to vie for their coach's save, or other twists employed such as \"instant elimination\", where an artist faced immediate elimination without going through a public vote. However, in deciding who moves on to the final four phase, the television audience and the coaches have equal say. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale, where the outcome is decided solely by public vote. Season 18-20 temporarily reverted this format allowing each coach to guarantee at least one artist advancing in the finale to accommodate the short number of live shows at three weeks,[11] but these changes were reversed on Season 21 by reverting to the regular elimination format while retaining the top five finalists.[12]\nIn a first for a music competition series, NBC and Universal Republic Records offered fans of the show the ability to vote for their favorite artists by purchasing the studio versions of the songs that they perform on the live show each week via the iTunes Store. Alternative methods of voting can be done through toll-free phone calls (until season 8), text messaging, \"The Voice Official App on NBC\" app, and online votes via NBC.com and Facebook. Each method is limited to ten votes per user, and voting lasts until noon EST the next day.\nFrom the top 12 results show of season 3 to the end of season 17, a rule regarding voting was enacted with regard to iTunes singles purchases. In the first two seasons, voting via iTunes purchases of contestant performances counted singly during the official voting window and only accredited to the live show in concern. When a competitor's performance peaked within the Top 10 of the iTunes \"Top 200 Singles Chart\" during this window, it was given an iTunes bonus that multiplies iTunes votes made by ten. In season 5, the iTunes bonus multiplier was reduced to five for the studio versions of the songs performed by the competitors. The finale's vote count included a 'Cumulative iTunes Vote Total' of all singles (from the live shows onwards) purchased during and outside of the various voting windows, with iTunes bonuses previously earned.[13] Between seasons 15 and 17, the bonus multiplier was revised to include streams counting as a vote, and the only artist with the most streams after the voting window ended would receive the bonus.[14] The iTunes bonus multiplier was discontinued beginning with the live shows of season 18, as the performances are now recorded away from the studios and could not be recorded to iTunes or Spotify; this measure was initially enacted for safety reasons as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.[15] In season 19, studio performances are now recorded on YouTube Music, replacing the traditional iTunes and Spotify recordings that were done between the seasons 2\u201317, but this was changed back beginning season 20, though bonuses do not apply regardless if the song charted within the top 10 or not. Season 22 was the first season to not have any studio performances released on any platform overall.\nOnly the studio recording of the contestants' performances, not the live performance, were available on iTunes. In the first season, the battle rounds were recorded in the studio with both artists in the pairing. However, from season 2 to season 18, only the winner's version of the song from the battle round was released. Season 7 reverted to the old style of both artists. With the introduction of the Knockout Rounds in season three, where each contestant sang a separate song, only the winner's single was released.\nThe \"Instant Save\" was introduced in season five. During the live elimination episodes, viewers are given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants at risk of elimination by using their Twitter account (and since season 17, the official app) to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 13. Home viewers can only vote once per account for one contestant of their choice. Since season six, the instant saves now function as a last-chance performance where artists perform an additional song to rally votes.\nCeeLo Green of Gnarls Barkley and Adam Levine of Maroon 5 became the first confirmed coaches in February 2011,[16] followed by Christina Aguilera[17] and Blake Shelton in March.[18] Aguilera and Green did not return for season four and were replaced by Shakira and Usher.[19] Aguilera and Green then returned for season five, while Shakira and Usher returned for season six.[20][21] In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in February 2014, Green revealed that he would not be returning to The Voice.[22] On March 31, 2014, it was announced that Pharrell Williams would become Green's replacement.[23] On April 19, 2014, it was announced that No Doubt's Gwen Stefani would replace Aguilera in season seven due to her pregnancy.[citation needed] On May 20, 2014, Shakira and Usher confirmed that after season six, they would focus on their music.[24][25] On March 25, 2016, Miley Cyrus confirmed that following her role as key advisor during the tenth season that she would be joining the series once again in its eleventh season as a coach.[26] That same day, Alicia Keys was also announced to be joining the series as a coach for the eleventh season.[27] On October 18, 2016, it was announced that Stefani would re-join the coaches' panel for the series' twelfth season, alongside returning coaches Keys, Levine and Shelton; it was also confirmed that Cyrus would return for the thirteenth season.[28]\nOn April 27, 2017, in an interview published by TV Insider, Keys confirmed that the twelfth season would be her last.

Previously in 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that The Voice \"is most popular in North Dakota and least popular in New York. It was behind only Duck Dynasty and Fast N' Loud in its correlation with Trump voters\".[57]\nThe first season premiered strong at 11.78 million viewers and actually grew upon that audience through its first season. In the 18\u201349 demographic, the show constantly found itself in the top 5. For its average season rating, the show landed itself as no. 20 with total viewers at nearly 12 million viewers. In the 18\u201349 rankings, the show was no. 4 at a 5.4 ranking.\nThe second season premiered on Super Bowl Sunday, February 5, 2012, and for a while managed to keep a 6.0 in the adults 18\u201349 demographic and 17 million viewers. Partnering The Voice with Smash (NBC's musical drama) helped NBC win the Monday night ratings. However, by Monday, April 9, the ratings had fallen to a 4.0 rating in the adult 18\u201349 demographic.\nThe third season premiered on Monday, September 10, 2012, to 12.28 million viewers and a 4.2 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic and has since then grown to a season-high 4.8 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic on October 8, October 15 and 29, 2012 and a 4.9 rating in the finale. The Voice, along with NBC's new drama, Revolution has once again led NBC to win every Monday night of the season so far, just like it did last season. On Tuesdays, comedies Go On and The New Normal has been successful thanks to The Voice, leading NBC to be the only network of the Big 5 to grow in ratings from last season.\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\nThe Voice: I Want You is a video game based on the television show. It was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Wii U on October 21, 2014, and was published by Activision. The game includes a microphone and has songs from the show including songs performed by the coaches.\nThe Voice is broadcast on the NBC network in the United States.

        "context": "\nDuring the 19th century, women's peace groups in the United States tried establishing holidays and regular activities in favor of peace and against war. A common early activity was the meeting of groups of mothers whose sons had fought or died on opposite sides of the American Civil War.[3]\nIn 1868, Ann Jarvis, Anna Jarvis's mother, organized a committee to establish a \"Mother's Friendship Day\", the purpose of which was \"to reunite families that had been divided during the Civil War.\" Ann Jarvis, who had previously organized Mother's Day Work Clubs to improve sanitation and health for both Union and Confederate encampments undergoing a typhoid outbreak, wanted to expand these into an annual memorial for mothers, but she died in 1905 before the annual celebration was established.[4][5] Her daughter, who became almost obsessed with her, would continue her mother's efforts.\nThere were several limited observances in the 1870s and the 1880s. Still, none achieved resonance beyond the local level.[4] At the time, Protestant schools in the United States already held many celebrations and observations such as Children's Day, Temperance Sunday, Roll Call Day, Decision Day, Missionary Day and others.[6] In New York City, Julia Ward Howe led a \"Mother's Day for Peace\" anti-war observance on June 2, 1872,[4][6][7] which was accompanied by an \"Appeal to womanhood throughout the world\" (nowadays known as Mother's Day Proclamation). The observance continued in Boston for about ten years under Howe's sponsorship, then died out.[8] In these celebrations, mothers all around the world would work towards world peace.[6]\nSeveral years later, a Mother's Day observance on May 13, 1877, was held in Albion, Michigan over a dispute related to the temperance movement.[9] According to local legend, Albion pioneer Juliet Calhoun Blakeley stepped up to complete the sermon of the Rev. Myron Daughterty who was distraught because an anti-temperance group had forced his son and two other temperance advocates at gunpoint to spend the night in a saloon and become publicly drunk. From the pulpit, Blakeley called on other mothers to join her. Blakeley's two sons, both traveling salesmen, were so moved that they vowed to return each year to pay tribute to her and embarked on a campaign to urge their business contacts to do likewise. At their urging, in the early 1880s, the Methodist Episcopal Church in Albion set aside the second Sunday in May to recognize the special contributions of mothers.[citation needed]\nFrank E. Hering, alumnus and administrator at the University of Notre Dame and President of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, made a plea for \"setting aside one day in the year as a nationwide memorial to the memories of Mothers and motherhood\" in 1904.[10][11] After observing a class of Notre Dame students sending home penny postcards to their mothers, Hering went on to be a vocal advocate for a national Mother's Day for the next decade.[10] As Hering stated in a 1941 issue of Scholastic: \"Throughout history the great men of the world have given their credit for their achievements to their mothers. [The] Holy Church recognizes this, as does Notre Dame especially, and Our Lady who watches over our great institution.\"[10]\nMother's Day Historical Marker at Market and N. Juniper Sts. Philadelphia PAPresident Wilson's Mother's Day Proclamation of May 9, 1914\nIn its present form, Mother's Day was established by Anna Jarvis with the help of Philadelphia merchant John Wanamaker following the death of her mother, Ann Jarvis, on May 9, 1905. Jarvis never mentioned Howe or Mothering Sunday, and she never mentioned any connection to the Protestant school celebrations, always claiming that the creation of Mother's Day was hers alone.[12]\nJarvis then campaigned to establish Mother's Day first as a U.S. national holiday and then later as an international holiday.[14] The holiday was declared officially by the state of West Virginia in 1910, and the rest of the states followed quickly.[4]\nOn May 10, 1913, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on all federal government officials (from the president down) to wear a white carnation the following day in observance of Mother's Day.[15] On May 8, 1914, the U.S. Congress passed a law designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day and requesting a proclamation. The next day, President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation declaring the first national Mother's Day[16][17] as a day for American citizens to show the flag in honor of those mothers whose sons had died in war.[16] In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a stamp commemorating the holiday.[18]\nIn 1912 Anna Jarvis trademarked the phrases \"Second Sunday in May\" and \"Mother's Day\", and created the Mother's Day International Association.[22] She specifically noted that \"Mother's\" should \"be a singular possessive, for each family to honor its own mother, not a plural possessive commemorating all mothers in the world.\"[23] This is also the spelling used by President Woodrow Wilson in his 1914 presidential proclamation, by the Congress in relevant bills,[19][20] and by various presidents in their proclamations concerning Mother's Day.[24]\nTraditions on Mother's Day include churchgoing, the distribution of carnations, and family dinners.[1] Mother's Day is the third largest holiday in the United States for sending cards. According to the greeting card industry, it is estimated that more than 50 percent of American households send greeting cards on this holiday. The holiday has been heavily commercialized by advertisers and retailers, and has been criticized by some as a Hallmark Holiday.[25][26]\nCarnations have come to represent Mother's Day since Anna Jarvis delivered 500 at the first celebration in 1908.[4][17][21] Many religious services held later adopted the custom of giving away carnations.[4] This also started the custom of wearing a carnation on Mother's Day. The founder, Anna Jarvis, chose the carnation because it was her mother's favorite flower.[27] In part due to the shortage of white carnations, and in part due to the efforts to expand the sales of more types of flowers in Mother's Day, florists invented the idea of wearing a pink carnation if your mother was living, or a white one if she was dead; this was tirelessly promoted until it made its way into the popular observations at churches.[28] Other less traditional flower options may include roses, a live blooming plant, flower leis, or a bouquet of a variety of different flowers.\nThe commercialization of U.S. holidays began very early. Only nine years after the first official Mother's Day, it had become so rampant that Anna Jarvis herself became a prominent opponent of what the holiday had become,[23][29] spending all her inheritance and the rest of her life fighting what she saw as an abuse of the celebration.[23] She decried the practice of purchasing greeting cards, which she saw as a sign of being too lazy to write a personal letter. She was arrested in 1948 for disturbing the peace while protesting against the commercialization of Mother's Day, and she finally said that she \"...wished she would have never started the day because it became so out of control ...\"[29] She died later that year.\nMother's Day is now one of the most commercially successful American occasions, having become the most popular day of the year to dine out at a restaurant in the United States[30] and generating a significant portion of the U.S. jewelry industry's annual revenue, from custom gifts like mother's rings.[31] Americans spend approximately $2.6 billion on flowers, $1.53 billion on pampering gifts\u2014like spa treatments\u2014and another $68 million on greeting cards.[32]\nIt has been suggested that commercialization has ensured that the holiday has continued. In contrast, other holidays from the same time, such as Children's Day and Temperance Sunday,[33] are no longer celebrated.[34]\nFrom 2007\u20132018, The Players Championship men's golf tournament was held on Mother's Day weekend, except in 2011 and 2014 when May 1 fell on a Sunday. In those cases, it was held the following weekend. Previously, the Kingsmill Championship women's golf tournament was played on Mother's Day weekend from 2004 to 2009.\nProfessional sports players often wear pink clothing accessories on Mother's Day weekend.\n^O'Reilly, Andrea (April 6, 2010). Encyclopedia of Motherhood. Sage Publications (CA). p. 602. ISBN978-1-4522-6629-9. She organized the first official Mother's Day service at Andrews Methodist Church in Grafton, West Virginia, on the morning of May 10, 1908. That same afternoon, 15,000 people attended a Mother's Day service at the Wanamaker Store Auditorium in Philadelphia, which she also organized. Jarvis chose the second Sunday in May for Mother's Day to mark the anniversary of her mother's death and selected her mother's favorite flower, the white carnation, as the day's official emblem.\n^The First Anniversary of 'Mother's Day'\", The New York Times, June 3, 1874, p. 8: \"'Mother's Day,' which was inaugurated in this city on the 2nd of June, 1872, by Mrs. Julia Ward Howards[sic], was celebrated last night at Plimpton Hall by a mother's peace meeting...\"\n^ abRice, Susan Tracey and Robert Haven Schauffler (1915).

        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%27s_Day_(United_States)#:~:text=2023%C2%A0date,June%2018",
        "context": "\nFather's Day is an annual holiday honoring people's fathers and celebrating the fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society. It was first proposed by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, in 1909.[1] It is currently celebrated in the United States annually on the third Sunday in June.[2]\nFather's Day was inaugurated in the United States in the early 20th century to complement Mother's Day in celebrating fathers, fathering, and fatherhood.\nFather's Day was founded in Spokane, Washington, at the YMCA in 1910 by Sonora Smart Dodd, who was born in Arkansas.[3] Its first celebration was in the Spokane YMCA on June 19, 1910.[3][4] Her father, the Civil War veteran William Jackson Smart, was a single parent who raised his six children there.[3] After hearing a sermon about Anna Jarvis's Mother's Day at Central Methodist Episcopal Church in 1909, she told her pastor that fathers should have a similar holiday honoring them.[3][5] Although she initially suggested June 5, her father's birthday, the pastors of the Spokane Ministerial Alliance did not have enough time to prepare their sermons, and the celebration was deferred to the third Sunday of June.[6][7]\nIt did not have much success initially. In the 1920s, Dodd stopped promoting the celebration because she was studying at the Art Institute of Chicago, and it faded into relative obscurity, even in Spokane.[8] In the 1930s, Dodd returned to Spokane and started promoting the celebration again, raising awareness at a national level.[9] She had the help of those trade groups that would benefit most from the holiday, for example the manufacturers of ties, tobacco pipes, and any traditional present to fathers.[10] Since 1938, she had the help of the Father's Day Council, founded by the New York Associated Men's Wear Retailers to consolidate and systematize the commercial promotion.[11] Americans resisted the holiday at first, perceiving it as just an attempt by merchants to replicate the commercial success of Mother's Day, and newspapers frequently featured cynical and sarcastic attacks and jokes.[12] But the trade groups did not give up: they kept promoting it and even incorporated the jokes into their adverts, and they eventually succeeded.[13] By the mid-1980s, the Father's Council wrote that \"(...) [Father's Day] has become a Second Christmas for all the men's gift-oriented industries.\"[14]\nA bill to accord national recognition of the holiday was introduced in Congress in 1913.[15] In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson went to Spokane to speak at a Father's Day celebration[16] and wanted to make it official, but Congress resisted, fearing that it would become commercialized.[17] US President Calvin Coolidge recommended in 1924 that the day be observed by the nation but stopped short of issuing a national proclamation.[16] Two earlier attempts to formally recognize the holiday had been defeated by Congress.[16][18] In 1957, Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith wrote a proposal accusing Congress of ignoring fathers for 40 years while honoring mothers, thus \"[singling] out just one of our two parents\".[18] In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued the first presidential proclamation honoring fathers, designating the third Sunday in June as Father's Day.[17] Six years later, the day was made a permanent national holiday when President Richard Nixon signed it into law on April 24, 1972.[2][16][17][18]\nIn addition to Father's Day, International Men's Day is celebrated in many countries on November 19 for men and boys who are not fathers.\nA \"Father's Day\" service was held on July 5, 1908, in Fairmont, West Virginia, in the Williams Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church South, now known as Central United Methodist Church.[6] Grace Golden Clayton was mourning the loss of her father who died when, on December 6, 1907, the Monongah mining disaster in nearby Monongah killed 361 men, 250 of them fathers, leaving around a thousand fatherless children. Clayton suggested to her pastor, Robert Thomas Webb, that he should honor all those fathers.[19][20][21] Clayton chose the Sunday nearest to the birthday of her father, Methodist minister Fletcher Golden.\nClayton's event did not have repercussions outside of Fairmont for several reasons, among them: the city was overwhelmed by other events, the celebration was never promoted outside of the town itself and no proclamation was made in the City Council. Also two events overshadowed this event: the celebration of Independence Day July 4, 1908, with 12,000 attendees and several shows including a hot air balloon event, which took over the headlines in the following days, and the death of a 16-year-old girl on July 4. The local church and Council were overwhelmed and they did not even think of promoting the event, and it was not celebrated again for many years. The original sermon was not reproduced in the press, and it was lost. Finally, Clayton was a quiet person, who never promoted the event or even talked to other persons about it.[19][20][21]\nClayton also may have been inspired by Anna Jarvis' crusade to establish Mother's Day; two months prior, Jarvis had held a celebration for her dead mother in Grafton, West Virginia, a town about 15 miles (24 km) away from Fairmont.[citation needed]\nIn 1911, Jane Addams proposed a citywide Father's Day in Chicago, but she was turned down.[7]\nIn 1912, there was a Father's Day celebration in Vancouver, Washington, suggested by Methodist pastor J. J. Berringer of the Irvingtom Methodist Church. They believed mistakenly that they had been the first to celebrate such a day.[6] They followed a 1911 suggestion by the Portland Oregonian.[7]\nHarry C. Meek, member of Lions Clubs International, claimed that he had the first idea for Father's Day in 1915.[6][7] Meek claimed that the third Sunday of June was chosen because it was his birthday (it would have been more natural to choose his father's birthday).[7] The Lions Club has named him \"Originator of Father's Day\".[6] Meek made many efforts to promote Father's Day and make it an official holiday.[6][7]\nIn the United States, Dodd used the \"Fathers' Day\" spelling on her original petition for the holiday,[3] but the spelling \"Father's Day\" was already used in 1913 when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress as the first attempt to establish the holiday,[15] and it was still spelled the same way when its creator was commended in 2008 by the U.S. Congress.[22]\n^Butler, Joey (June 18, 2010). \"Father's Day has Methodist ties\". The United Methodist Church. Retrieved June 17, 2015. In 1909 in Spokane, Wash., Sonora Smart Dodd listened to a Mother's Day sermon at Central Methodist Episcopal Church. Dodd's own mother had died 11 years earlier, and her father had raised their six children alone. Dodd felt moved to honor her father, and fathers everywhere, with a special day as well. She proposed her idea to local religious leaders, and gained wide acceptance. June 19, 1910, was designated as the first Father's Day, and sermons honoring fathers were presented throughout the city.",

        "context": "\nThe Pepperstone ATP rankings[1] are the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) merit-based system for determining the rankings in men's tennis. The top-ranked player is the player who, over the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ranking points on the ATP Tour. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.[2] Starting in 1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week. Since 1973, 28 players have been ranked No. 1 by the ATP,[3][4] of which 17 have been year-end No. 1.\nSince the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo, the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250 tournaments. Lower-ranked players who are not eligible for some or all of the top tournaments may include additional ATP 500 and ATP 250 events, and also ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Men's Circuit tournaments. Players who qualify for the year-end ATP Finals also include any points gained from the tournament in their total, increasing the number of tournaments counted to 19.[5]\nCarlos Alcaraz is both the youngest world No. 1 (19 years, 4 months),[18] and the youngest year-end No. 1 (19 years, 7 months).[19] Federer is the oldest No. 1 (36 years, 10 months),[20] while Djokovic is the oldest year-end No. 1 (36 years, 7 months).[21]\nFederer is the player with the longest time span (14 years) between his first and most recent dates at No. 1 (February 2004\u2013June 2018),[22] while Rafael Nadal is the only player to hold the top ranking in three different decades, spanning 11 years and 5 months (2008\u20132020). Djokovic has the longest time span (12 years) between his first and last year-end No. 1 finish (2011\u20132023), and is the only player to be ranked No. 1 at least once in a year for 12 different years.[23]\nTwo players, Ivan Lendl and Marcelo R\u00edos, have reached No. 1 without previously having won a major singles title.[24] Lendl reached No. 1 on February 21, 1983, but did not win his first Grand Slam title until the 1984 French Open.[25] R\u00edos reached No. 1 on March 30, 1998, but retired without ever having won a Grand Slam title, making him the only No. 1 player with that distinction.[26][27]\nFederer holds the record of wire-to-wire No. 1 for three consecutive calendar years. Since 1973 when the ATP rankings started, there have been 13 years in which one player held the top spot for the entire year: Jimmy Connors in 1975, 1976, and 1978; Lendl in 1986 and 1987; Pete Sampras in 1994 and 1997; Hewitt in 2002; Federer in 2005, 2006, and 2007; and Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. In contrast, 1999 saw five players hold the No. 1 ranking (the most in any single year): Sampras, Carlos Moy\u00e1, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Andre Agassi, and Patrick Rafter.\nPrior to 2009, Federer accumulated the most year-end ATP ranking points in any season, with 8,370 points in 2006. Since the introduction of a new point scale for the ATP rankings from 2009, Djokovic achieved the same feat with 16,585 ranking points in 2015 season. Djokovic also holds the record of 16,950 ranking points on 6 June 2016, the most ATP points ever accumulated by any player.[28]\nJohn McEnroe held the No. 1 ranking a record 14 times, Sampras and Djokovic are the only two other players to have held it 10 or more times, with 11 and 10 stints respectively. Rafter spent the least time at number 1 (one week).\nNovak Djokovic holds an all-time record of eight year-end No. 1 finishes.Pete Sampras finished six consecutive seasons as year-end No. 1 in the 1990s.John McEnroe finished as the year-end No. 1 for four consecutive years in the 1980s.\nThe ATP year-end No. 1 (ATP Player of the Year), in recent decades, has been determined as the player who ends the year as world No. 1 in the ATP rankings. Prior to the early 1990s this was not always the case, in some instances the \"ATP Player of the Year\" and the Year-end No. 1 in the rankings were different players (1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1982, 1989). Novak Djokovic holds the ATP record of eight year-end No. 1 finishes.[15] Overall, 18 players have achieved the year-end No. 1 ranking, only four of them (Lendl, Federer, Djokovic, Nadal) have done so in non-consecutive years. Six players have stayed at No. 1 in the ATP rankings for every week of the calendar year. Connors and Federer have done so in three years, Connors non-consecutively and Federer consecutively.\n^Wilansky, Matt (August 31, 2006). \"Inside the numbers\". ESPN. ESPN Internet Ventures.

        "context": "\nA season is a period of the year that is distinguished by special climate conditions. The four seasons\u00e2\u0080\u0094spring, summer, fall, and winter\u00e2\u0080\u0094follow one another regularly. Each has its own light, temperature, and weather patterns that repeat yearly.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, winter generally begins on December 21 or 22. This is the winter solstice, the day of the year with the shortest period of daylight. Summer begins on June 20 or 21, the summer solstice, which has the most daylight of any day in the year. Spring and fall, or autumn, begin on equinoxes, days that have equal amounts of daylight and darkness. The vernal, or spring, equinox falls on March 20 or 21, and the autumnal equinox is on September 22 or 23.\nThe seasons in the Northern Hemisphere are the opposite of those in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that in Argentina and Australia, winter begins in June. The winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere is June 20 or 21, while the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, is December 21 or 22.\nSeasons occur because Earth is tilted on its axis relative to the orbital plane, the invisible, flat disc where most objects in the solar system orbit the sun. Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s axis is an invisible line that runs through its center, from pole to pole. Earth rotates around its axis.\nIn June, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rays hit it for a greater part of the day than in winter. This means it gets more hours of daylight. In December, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, with fewer hours of daylight.\nSeasons have an enormous influence on vegetation and plant growth. Winter typically has cold weather, little daylight, and limited plant growth. In spring, plants sprout, tree leaves unfurl, and flowersblossom. Summer is the warmest time of the year and has the most daylight, so plants grow quickly. In autumn, temperatures drop, and many trees lose their leaves.\nThe four-season year is typical only in the mid-latitudes. The mid-latitudes are places that are neither near the poles nor near the Equator. The farther north you go, the bigger the differences in the seasons. Helsinki, Finland, sees 18.5 hours of daylight in the middle of June. In mid-December, however, it is light for less than six hours. Athens, Greece, in southern Europe, has a smaller variation. It has 14.5 hours of daylight in June and 9.5 hours in December.\nPlaces near the Equator experience little seasonal variation. They have about the same amount of daylight and darkness throughout the year. These places remain warm year-round. Near the Equator, regions typically have alternating rainy and dry seasons.\nPolar regions experience seasonal variation, although they are generally colder than other places on Earth. Near the poles, the amount of daylight changes dramatically between summer and winter. In Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost city in the U.S., it stays light all day long between mid-May and early August. The city is in total darkness between mid-November and January.\nFast Fact\nSeasons in Alaska Sometimes, seasons are determined by both natural and artificial activity. In the U.S. state of Alaska, people like to say there are three seasons: \"winter, still winter, and construction season.\"\nFast Fact\nMeteorological Seasons Meteorologists, scientists who study the weather, divide each of the seasons into three whole months. Spring begins March 1, summer begins June 1, autumn begins September 1, and winter begins December 1.\nFast Fact\nRitu A ritu is a season in the traditional Hindu calendar, used in parts of India. There are six ritu: vasanta (spring); grishma (summer); varsha (rainy or monsoon); sharat (autumn); hemant (pre-winter); and shishira (winter).\nFast Fact\n'Tis the Season The word 'season' can be used to signify a time of year when an activity or process is allowed to happen. Seasons can be natural, like hurricane season, which is the time of year when hurricanes are most likely to develop. Seasons can also be artificially created, like hunting season, which is the time of year a community allows people to hunt certain wild animals.\nThe audio, illustrations, photos, and videos are credited beneath the media asset, except for promotional images, which generally link to another page that contains the media credit.

        "context": "\nThe Nebula Award for Best Novel is given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasynovels. A work of fiction is considered a novel by the organization if it is 40,000 words or longer; awards are also given out for pieces of shorter lengths, in the categories of short story, novelette, and novella. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration, a novel must have been published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible, provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition.[1] The Award has been given annually since 1966. Novels which were expanded forms of previously published stories are eligible, and novellas published individually can be considered as novels if the author requests it.[1] The award has been described as one of \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\" and \"the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent\" of the Emmy Awards.[2][3]\nNebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of SFWA, though the authors nominated do not need to be members. Works are nominated each year by members in a period around December 15 through January 31, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Soon after, members are given a month to vote on the ballot, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.[1]\nBeginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format, and nominated works must have been published during that calendar year. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as being one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication, and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Under the previous process, works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work if they felt it was overlooked.[4]\nDuring the 58 nomination years, 199 authors have had works nominated, and 45 of these have won (including co-authors and ties). Ursula K. Le Guin has received the most Nebula Awards for Best Novel, with four wins out of six nominations. Joe Haldeman has received the next most: three awards out of four nominations, while nine other authors have each won twice. Jack McDevitt has the most nominations at twelve (with one win), while Poul Anderson and Philip K. Dick tie for having the most nominations without winning an award, at five apiece.\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\". Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer's name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.",

        "context": "\nDonald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021.\nTrump received a BS in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, and his father named him president of his real estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it the Trump Organization and expanded its operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business reversals in the late twentieth century, he successfully launched various side ventures that required little capital, mostly by licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.\nTrump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote.[a] During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the first U.S. president with no prior military or government experience. The 2017\u20132019 special counsel investigation established that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump's campaign. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist and many as misogynistic.\nTrump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. He refused to concede defeat, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud, and attempted to overturn the results by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, which many of them then attacked, resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count.\nTrump is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he tried to pressure Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached in December by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress; he was acquitted by the Senate in February 2020. The House impeached him a second time in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection, and the Senate acquitted him the next month. Scholars and historians rank Trump as one of the worst presidents in American history.[1][2]\nWhile in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments during the Vietnam War era.[11] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968, a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve.[12] In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional medical deferment,[13] and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F due to bone spurs, permanently disqualifying him from service.[14]\nTrump has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\" but usually does not walk the course.[28] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes exercise depletes the body's energy \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\".[29] In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that Trump would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[30] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three Trump agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office.[30][31]\nIn 1982, Trump made the initial Forbes list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth (equivalent to $606 million in 2022).[32] His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[33] After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with the FEC in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10 billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities.[34]Forbes estimated his net worth dropped by $1.4 billion between 2015 and 2018.[35] In their 2021 billionaires ranking, Trump's net worth was estimated to be $2.4 billion (1,299th in the world).[36]\nJournalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that Trump called him in 1984, pretending to be a fictional Trump Organization official named \"John Barron\". Greenberg said that Trump, speaking as \"Barron\", falsely asserted that he owned more than 90 percent of his father's business to get a higher ranking for himself on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.[37]\nTrump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[38] He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's company.[39][40] In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance started an investigation.[40] His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets.[41][42]Forbes estimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $3.1 billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23 million to $3 million.[43]\nContrary to his claims of financial health and business acumen, Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250 million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7 million (equivalent to $1.76 billion in 2022).[44][45][32]\nIn 2020, the New York Times obtained Trump's tax information extending over two decades. Its reporters found that Trump reported losses of hundreds of millions of dollars and had, since 2010, deferred declaring $287 million in forgiven debt as taxable income. His income mainly came from his share in The Apprentice and businesses in which he was a minority partner, and his losses mainly from majority-owned businesses. Much income was in tax credits for his losses, which let him avoid annual income tax payments or lower them to $750. During the 2010s, Trump balanced his businesses' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower (due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.[46]\nAs of October 2021[update], Trump had over $1.3 billion in total debts, much of which is secured by his assets.[47] In 2020, he owed $640 million to banks and trust organizations, including Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, and approximately $450 million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt.[48]\nTrump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[53] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for Trump by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[50][54] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[55] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[56] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[57][58]\nIn 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks.[59] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[60] In 1995, Trump defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a humiliating restructuring that allowed Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy.[61][62] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they \"all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead.\"[62]\nIn 1996, Trump acquired the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building, and renovated it.[63] In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who were able to finance the project's completion, Riverside South.[64]\nIn 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[65] It was unprofitable, and Trump paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[66] In 1985, Trump bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[67] His wife Ivana managed it until 1988.[68] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[69]\nTrump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[70][71] Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, Trump gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[72] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[73]\nIn 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[74] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership.[65] He remained chairman until 2009.[75]\nIn 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[76] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[77] In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.[58]\nThe Trump name has been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings.[81][82] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, and they have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies.[83] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[81]\nTrump and New Jersey Generals quarterback Doug Flutie at a 1985 press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower\nIn September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (when they competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit against the organization.[84][85]\nFrom 1986 to 1988, Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[44] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail.[89]The New York Times found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".[44]\nIn 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $940 million in 2022)[32] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992.[90] Trump defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[91] The airline was eventually sold to US Airways.[90]\nIn 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20\u201350 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups.[40][92] The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units.[40]\nIn 2004, Trump co-founded Trump University, a company that sold real estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000.[99] After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[100]\nIn 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[101] In addition, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[102][103][104] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, Trump agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.[105]\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[106][107] In the foundation's final years, its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014.[108] The foundation gave to health-care- and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[109]\nIn 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[110] Also in 2016, the New York Attorney General determined the foundation to be in violation of state law for soliciting donations and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[111] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[112]\nIn June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[113][114] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[115] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[116][117]\nRoy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[118] According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.[118] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the United States government for $100 million (equivalent to $659 million in 2022)[32] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case went forward, ultimately resulting in a settlement.[119] In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[120] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[121]\nAccording to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[122] While Trump has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[123] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties.[123]\nDuring the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.[124] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[125] After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with Trump or his company in the future.[126]\nStarting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[133] He also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped! (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.[134][135] From 2011 until 2015, he was a weekly unpaid guest commentator on Fox & Friends.[136][137]\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Trump was co-producer and host of reality shows The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice. Trump played a flattering, highly fictionalized version of himself as a superrich and successful chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase \"You're fired\". The shows remade his image for millions of viewers nationwide.[138][139] With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million which he invested in largely unprofitable businesses.[140]\nIn February 2021, Trump resigned from the Screen Actors Guild he had been a member of since 1989 rather than face a disciplinary committee hearing for inciting the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and for his \"reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists\".[141] Two days later, the union permanently barred him from readmission.[142]\nTrump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in 1987;[143] a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999;[144] a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[143]\nIn 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers,[145] expressing his views on foreign policy and on how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[146] He ruled out running for local office but not for the presidency.[145] In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's running mate. Bush found the request \"strange and unbelievable\".[147]\nTrump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[156] He adopted the phrase \"truthful hyperbole\", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style.[128][157] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[158] and a record number of them were false.[159][160][161] The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has.\"[162][163] Trump said he disdained political correctness and frequently made claims of media bias.[164][165]\nTrump campaigning in Arizona, March 2016\nTrump announced his candidacy in June 2015.[166][167]His campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[168] He became the front-runner in March 2016[169] and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[170]\nTrump helped bring far-right fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[185] Trump was slow to disavow an endorsement from David Duke after he was questioned about it during a CNN interview on February 28, 2016.[186] Duke enthusiastically supported Trump and said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to \"take our country back\".[187][188] In August 2016, Trump hired Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u2014described by Bannon as \"the platform for the alt-right\"\u2014as his campaign CEO.[189] The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[190][191][192]\nTrump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.[34][193]\nTrump did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[194][195] He said his tax returns were being audited, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[196] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the United States Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[197][198]\nIn October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.[199]\nTrump's election victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities in the days following the election.[206][207] On the day after Trump's inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including an estimated half million in Washington, D.C., protested against Trump in the Women's Marches.[208]\nTrump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[209]\nBefore being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and a business associate.[212][213] Though he said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic. Trump continued to profit from his businesses and to know how his administration's policies affected his businesses.[213][214]\nIn December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The bill had been passed by both Republican-controlled chambers of Congress without any Democratic votes. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025, and eliminated the penalty associated with Affordable Care Act's individual mandate.[220][221] The Trump administration claimed that the act would either increase tax revenues or pay for itself by prompting economic growth. Instead, revenues in 2018 were 7.6 percent lower than projected.[222]\nDespite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump approved large increases in government spending and the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.[223] Under Trump, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75trillion by the end of his term, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post-World War II high.[224] Trump also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[225]\nTrump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3 million people.[218]\nTrump aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels.[230][231] Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[232][233] Trump rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Trump's actions while president have been called \"a very aggressive attempt to rewrite our laws and reinterpret the meaning of environmental protections\".[234]\nIn January 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, though it did not require elimination.[235] He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[236][237] labor,[238][237] and the environment,[239][237] among other topics. Trump signed 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions repealing federal regulations, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[240] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[241] often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[242] The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of Trump's proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[243]\nDuring his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[244] In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders 13765[245] and 13813.[246] Trump expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[247][248] Trump falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA.[249] In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the ACA unconstitutional.[250][251] If they had succeeded, it would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans.[250] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020, he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.[252]\nIn response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 deaths in 2019.[253]\nTrump barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[254] He said he supported \"traditional marriage\" but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[255] In March 2017, his administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBT people.[256] Trump's attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections for transgender patients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after the Supreme Court's ruling in July had extended employees' civil rights protections to gender identity and sexual orientation.[257]\nTrump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush.[267]\nOnly 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[268][269]\nFrom 2017 to 2019, he pardoned, amongst others, former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of classified areas inside a submarine;[270] and right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza.[271] Following a request by celebrity Kim Kardashian, Trump commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who had been convicted of drug trafficking.[272] Trump also pardoned or reversed the sentences of three American servicemen convicted or accused of committing war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq.[273]\nTrump and group of officials and advisors on the way from White House complex to St. John's Church\nOn June 1, 2020, federal law-enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House.[278][279] Trump then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church, where protesters had set a small fire the night before; he posed for photographs holding a Bible, with senior administration officials later joining him in photos.[278][280] Trump said on June 3 that the protesters were cleared because \"they tried to burn down the church [on May 31] and almost succeeded\", describing the church as \"badly hurt\".[281]\nReligious leaders condemned the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[282] Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[283]\nTrump attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.[290][291]\nFrom 2018 onward, Trump deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border[292] to stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum. In 2020, his administration widened the public charge rule to further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency via green cards.[293] Trump reduced the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. to record lows. When Trump took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.[294][295] Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted compared to the allowed limits.[296]\nFollowing the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[297] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[298]\nThe temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[305] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017,[306] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling.[307]\nThe Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[308][309] In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted.[310] This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors.[311] Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.[312]\nThe policy of family separations was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.[312][313] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration's policy.[314][315][316]\nAlthough Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" doing so would pose a risk to the child.[317][318] On June 26, 2018, Judge Dana Sabraw concluded that the Trump administration had \"no system in place to keep track of\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;[319] Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.[320] After the federal-court order, the Trump administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; the ACLU contended that the Trump administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.[309]\nOne of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[321] By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64 km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53 km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587 km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[322]\nIn 2018, Trump refused to sign any appropriations bill from Congress unless it allocated $5.6 billion in funds for the border wall,[323] resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.[324][325] Around 800,000 government employees were furloughed or worked without pay.[326] Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall.[324] The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3 billion to the economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office.[327] About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped.[328]\nTrump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[335] and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[336] His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of populist, neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments.[337] Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty,[336] a lack of a consistent foreign policy,[338] and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies.[339] He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from the alliance.[340][341]\nTrump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[342] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[343] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[344] While Trump said that import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[345] Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the trade deficit in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, \"was the largest monthly deficit since July 2008\".[346] Following a 2017\u20132018 renegotiation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[347]\nHowever, no denuclearization agreement was reached,[381] and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[382] While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.[383][384]\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meeting with Taliban delegation in Qatar in September 2020\nU.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[385] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[386] In February 2020, the Trump administration signed a conditional peace agreement with the Taliban, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000 Taliban imprisoned by the Afghan government.[387][388][389] By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating Al-Qaeda members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[389]\nIn December 2018, Trump declared \"we have won against ISIS\", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.[401][402] The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling his decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s Kurdish allies who played a key role in fighting ISIS.[403] One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.[404]\nIn October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area and Turkey invaded northern Syria, attacking and displacing American-allied Kurds in the area.[405] Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for \"abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe\".[406][407]\nAfter an Iranian missile test on January 29, 2017, and Houthi attacks on Saudi warships, the Trump administration sanctioned 12 companies and 13 individuals suspected of being involved in Iran's missile program.[408] In May 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program.[409][410] Analysts determined that, after the United States's withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[411]\nThe Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[418] As of early July 2018[update], 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[419] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[420] Both figures set a record for recent presidents\u2014more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[421] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[421] Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee, and Keith Schiller quit or were forced out.[422] Some, including Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts.[423] Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[424]\nOn May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's roles in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[428] At a private conversation in February, Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.[429] In March and April, Trump asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.[429][430]\nTurnover was relatively high within the Trump Cabinet.[422] Trump lost three of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year.[431] Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.[431][422] Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.[432][433]\nTrump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[434] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61 percent) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37 percent).[435]\nTrump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. Trump's attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of Trump's statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.[444][445][446]\nTrump's public statements on COVID-19 were at odds with his private statements. In February 2020 Trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly than influenza, was \"very much under control\", and would soon be over.[451] At the same time he acknowledged the opposite in a private conversation with Bob Woodward. In March 2020, Trump privately told Woodward that he was deliberately \"playing it down\" in public so as not to create panic.[452][453]\nTrump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[454][455] Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak, and largely ignored the danger.[456] By mid-March, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the emerging pandemic.[457]\nOn March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.[458] On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic,[447] and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13.[459] That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \"horrible\" but \"a temporary moment\" and saying there was no financial crisis.[460] On March 13, he declared a national emergency, freeing up federal resources.[461] Trump falsely claimed that \"anybody that wants a test can get a test\", despite the availability of tests being severely limited.[462]\nIn September 2019, the Trump administration terminated United States Agency for International Development's PREDICT program, a $200 million epidemiological research program initiated in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad.[463][464] The program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. One such laboratory was the Wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes COVID-19. After revival in April 2020, the program was given two 6-month extensions to help fight COVID-19 in the U.S. and other countries.[465][466]\nOn April 22, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration to the United States.[467] In late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.[468]\nTrump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020.[469] Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[470] sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[471] Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[470][472] On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[473] His repeated use of the terms \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[474][475][476]\nBy early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the World Health Organization (WHO).[477] The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[478] the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[479][480]\nIn early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would \"indefinitely\" continue.[481] By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced.[482]\nPrior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[483] His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[483] In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus\" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic.[483][484][485] He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[483] Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[483][486][487] In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021.[484][485] The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\".[484][485]\nIn June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\".[488][489] The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[490][491] In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[492][493] The day after this political interference was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested.[493]\nIn April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[494][495] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[496] even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's own guidelines for reopening.[497] In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[498] Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy.[499]\nTrump often refused to wear a face mask at public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public[500] and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus.[501] By June, Trump had said masks were a \"double-edged sword\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[501] Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[500][501]\nDespite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are \"totally harmless\".[502][503] He also began insisting that all states should open schools to in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.[504]\nTrump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[492] such as approving unproven treatments[505][506] or speeding up the approval of vaccines.[506] Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[507][508] Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[509]\nOn October 2, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID-19.[510][511] His wife, their son Barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected.[512][513]\nLater that day Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to labored breathing and a fever. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October 5, still struggling with the disease.[514] During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.[512] In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case of the disease.[513]\nBy July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue for the 2020 presidential election.[515] Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election.[516] Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[515] and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[517] In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths.[518] A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[519]\nAfter he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[520] There were 30 investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[521]\nDuring the 2016 presidential election campaign, American Media, Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer,[528] and a company set up by Cohen paid Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actressStormy Daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[529] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump to influence the presidential election.[530] Trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017.[531][532] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[533] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[534][535] Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019,[536] but the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments[537] and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns.[538] In November 2022, The New York Times reported that Manhattan prosecutors were \"newly optimistic about building a case\" against Trump.[539]\nIn January 2017, American intelligence agencies\u2014the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence\u2014jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[540][541] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[542] Many suspicious[543]links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies were discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\" were widely reported by the press.[544][545]\nManafort, one of Trump's campaign managers, worked from December 2004 to February 2010 to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency.[546] Other Trump associates, including Flynn and Stone, were connected to Russian officials.[547][548] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[549] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[550][551] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.[552] Trump told Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[553]\nTrump and his allies promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election\u2014which was also promoted by Russia to frame Ukraine.[554] After the Democratic National Committee was hacked, Trump first claimed it withheld \"its server\" from the FBI (in actuality there were more than 140 servers, of which digital copies were given to the FBI); second, that CrowdStrike, the company that investigated the servers, was Ukraine-based and Ukrainian-owned (in actuality, CrowdStrike is U.S.-based, with the largest owners being American companies); and third that \"the server\" was hidden in Ukraine. Members of the Trump administration spoke out against the conspiracy theories.[555]\nIn July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamed Crossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[556] After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia.[557] Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[558] but deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ended the investigation into Trump's direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that Mueller would pursue the matter.[559][560]\nIn May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, special counsel for the Department of Justice (DOJ), ordering him to \"examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the Trump campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference\".[559] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[561] and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[562] Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[563]\nIn March 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr.[564] Two days later, Barr sent a letter to Congress purporting to summarize the report's main conclusions. A federal court, as well as Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation's conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.[565][566][567] Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not exonerate him.[568]\nA redacted version of the report was publicly released in April 2019. It found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's.[569] Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the report found that the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[570][571] The report revealed sweeping Russian interference[571] and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing \"[they] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\".[572][573][574][575]\nThe report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not make a \"traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on whether Trump broke the law, suggesting that Congress should make such a determination.[576][577] Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\" as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,[578] and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[579] The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[578] The House of Representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[580][581]\nSeveral Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller's investigation and related cases, including Manafort, convicted on eight felony counts,[582] deputy campaign manager Rick Gates,[583] foreign policy advisor Papadopoulos,[584] and Flynn.[585][586] Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as \"Individual-1\" in the court documents.[587] In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering regarding his attempts to learn more about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 election. The sentencing judge said Stone \"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\".[588]\nIn August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter.[589] The whistleblower said that the White House had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.[590]\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[591] Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.[592][593] On September 25, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.[589][594] The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[595] In October, William B. Taylor Jr., the charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment investigating the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[596] He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.[597]\nDuring the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers presented their case for three days. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution's impeachment process.[600]\nTrump displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted\"\nResponding over the next three days, Trump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[601] They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[601]\nOn January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents; 51 Republicans formed the majority for this vote.[602] The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.[603]\nTrump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority, 52\u201348 on abuse of power and 53\u201347 on obstruction of Congress. Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict Trump on one charge, the abuse of power.[604] Following his acquittal, Trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.[605]\nBreaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[606] He held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office[607] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.[608]\nIn his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million and began 2019 with $19.3 million in cash.[609] By July 2020, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1 billion and spent $800 million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.[610] The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.[611]\nTrump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won the presidency.[612] Trump repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions[613][614] and shifted to appeals to racism.[615]\nStarting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[616][617] In July, Trump raised the idea of delaying the election.[618] When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[619] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.[620][621]\nBiden won the election on November 3, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent)[622][623] and 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.[624]\nAt 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[625] After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump stated that \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[626] Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[627][628] Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials.[629] After Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17.[630] On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from the Texas attorney general that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[631]\nTrump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.[632] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition.[633][634] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[635] Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.[636][637]\nThe Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14.[624] From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results of the election, personally pressuring various Republican local and state office-holders,[638] Republican state and federal legislators,[639] the Justice Department,[640] and Vice President Pence,[641] urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result.[639] On February 10, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.[642]\nIn December 2020, Newsweek reported the Pentagon was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if Trump decided to declare martial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of elections.[644]\nWhen Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and CIA director Gina Haspel became concerned about the threat of a possible coup attempt or military action against China or Iran.[645][646] Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed Haspel and NSA director Paul Nakasone to monitor developments closely.[647][648]\nOn January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the United States Capitol, Trump held a noon rally at the Ellipse, Washington, D.C.. He called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol to \"show strength\" and \"fight like hell\".[649][650] Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. Around 2:15p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[651] During the violence, Trump watched TV and posted messages on Twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. At 6p.m., Trump tweeted that the rioters should \"go home with love & in peace\", calling them \"great patriots\" and \"very special\" and repeating that the election was stolen from him.[652] After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning.[653] According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.[654][655]\nIn March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a song to benefit the prisoners, and, in June, he said that, if elected, he would pardon a large number of them.[656]\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signing the second impeachment of Trump\nOn January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection against the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[657] The House voted 232\u2013197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[658] Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment\u2014the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[659]\nOn February 13, following a five-day Senate trial, Trump was acquitted when the Senate voted 57\u201343 for conviction, falling ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.[660][661] Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January 20; the Senate voted 56\u201344 the trial was constitutional);[662] included in the latter group was Mitch McConnell.[663]\nAt the end of his term, Trump went to live at his Mar-a-Lago club.[664] As provided for by the Former Presidents Act,[665] he established an office there to handle his post-presidential activities.[665][666]\nTrump's false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \"big lie\" in the press and by his critics. In May 2021, Trump and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself.[667][668] The Republican Party used Trump's false election narrative to justify the imposition of new voting restrictions in its favor.[668][669] As late as July 2022, Trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election by rescinding the state's electoral votes for Biden.[670]\nUnlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; he has been compared to a modern-day party boss. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, hinted at a third candidacy, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on the people in charge of elections and how elections are run. In the 2022 midterm elections he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices, most of whom supported his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.[674][675][676] A majority of candidates endorsed by him won in Republican primary elections.[675]\nIn February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social, a Twitter-like social-media platform.[682] As of March 2023[update], Trump Media, which had taken $8 million from Russia-connected entities, was being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible money laundering.[683][684]\nWhen Trump left the White House in January 2021, he took government documents and material with him to Mar-a-Lago. By May 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the federal agency that preserves government records, realized that important documents had not been turned over to them at the end of Trump's term and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA later informed the Department of Justice that some of the retrieved documents were classified material.[692] The Justice Department began an investigation in April 2022 and convened a grand jury.[693] The Justice Department sent Trump a subpoena for additional material on May 11.[692] On June 3, Justice Department officials visited Mar-a-Lago and received some classified documents from Trump's lawyers.[692] One of the lawyers signed a statement affirming that all material marked as classified had been returned to the government.[694] Later that month an additional subpoena was sent requesting surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, which was provided.[692][695][696]\nOn August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Trump's residence, office, and storage areas at Mar-a-Lago to recover government documents and material Trump had taken with him when he left office in violation of the Presidential Records Act,[697][698] reportedly including some related to nuclear weapons.[696] The search warrant, authorized by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and approved by a federal magistrate judge, and the written inventory of the seized items were made public on August 12. The text of the search warrant indicates an investigation of potential violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice laws.[699] The items taken in the search included 11 sets of classified documents, four of them tagged as \"top secret\" and one as \"top secret/SCI\", the highest level of classification.[697][698]\nOn March 30, 2023, a New York grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.[703][704] On April 4, he surrendered and was arrested and arraigned; he pleaded not guilty on all counts and was released.[705] The trial is scheduled to begin on March 25, 2024.[706]\nOn June 8, the Justice Department indicted Trump in Miami federal court for 31 counts of \"willfully retaining national defense information under the Espionage Act\", one count of making false statements, and, jointly with a personal aide, single counts of conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding government documents, corruptly concealing records, concealing a document in a federal investigation and scheming to conceal their efforts.[707] Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.[708] In July a superseding indictment added three additional criminal charges, bringing the number of charges in the case to 40.[709] The trial is scheduled to begin on May 20, 2024.[706]\nOn August 1, a Washington, D.C., federal grand jury indicted Trump on four counts for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. He was charged with conspiring with unnamed co-conspirators to defraud the United States, obstruct the certification of the Electoral College vote, and deprive people of the civil right to have their votes counted, as well as obstructing an official proceeding.[710] Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.[711] The case is slated to go to trial on March 4, 2024.[706]\nOn August 14, a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury indicted Trump and 18 allies for racketeering \u2013 among other felonies \u2013 after Trump campaign officials accessed voting machines with election officials.[712][713] On August 24, Trump surrendered, was placed under arrest and processed at Fulton County Jail, and released on bail. He posted the mug shot on Twitter and on his campaign website with a fundraising pitch.[714] On August 31, he pleaded not guilty.[715]\nIn 2018, four investors filed a federal class action lawsuit against Trump, the Trump Organization, and his three eldest children for not disclosing that they were paid by ACN, Inc., when they recommended the company as a sound investment on The Apprentice.[716] In July 2019, a district judge permitted the lawsuit to proceed with state-level claims of fraud, false advertising, and unfair competition.[717] The case is slated to go to trial on January 29, 2024.[718]\nIn September 2022, the New York State Attorney General filed a civil fraud case against Trump, his three oldest children, and the Trump Organization.[719] In December 2021, the Attorney General's office had subpoenaed Trump to produce documents related to his business.[720] In April 2022, a New York state judge held Trump in contempt of court for failing to comply with the subpoena and imposed a fine of $10,000 per day until he does.[721] Trump was deposed in August and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times.[722] The judge presiding over the civil suit ruled in September 2023 that Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization repeatedly committed fraud and ordered their New York business certificates canceled and their business entities sent into receivership for dissolution.[723]\nIn May 2023, a New York jury in a federal lawsuit brought by journalist E. Jean Carroll found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered him to pay her $5 million.[724] Trump asked the district court for a new trial or a reduction of the damage award, arguing that the jury had not found him liable for rape, and also, in a separate lawsuit, countersued Carroll for defamation. The judge for the two lawsuits ruled against Trump in July and August.[725][726] Trump appealed both decisions to an appeals court.[725][727] The trial in the defamation case is scheduled to begin on January 15, 2024.[706]\nC-SPAN, which has surveyed presidential historians on presidential leadership each time the administration changed since 2000,[731] ranked Trump fourth\u2013lowest overall in their Presidential Historians Survey 2021, with Trump rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.[1][732][733] The Siena College Research Institute (SCRI) has surveyed presidential scholars during the second year of the first term of each president since 1982. In their 2022 survey, SCRI ranked Trump 43rd out of 45 presidents. He was ranked last on background, integrity, intelligence, foreign policy accomplishments, and executive appointments, and second to last on ability to compromise, executive ability, and present overall view. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership.[2]\nTrump was the only president never to reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938. His approval ratings showed a record-high partisan gap: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.[734] Until September 2020, the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of 49 percent and a low of 35 percent.[735] Trump finished his term with an approval rating between 29 percent and 34 percent\u2014the lowest of any president since modern polling began\u2014and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency.[734][736]\nIn Gallup's annual poll asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for most admired man in 2019, and was named most admired in 2020.[737][738] Since Gallup started conducting the poll in 1948, Trump is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.[739]\nA Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between the years 2016 and 2017 found that Trump led Obama in job approval in only 29 countries, most of them non-democracies;[740] approval of U.S. leadership plummeted among allies and G7 countries. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the George W. Bush presidency.[741] By mid-2020, only 16 percent of international respondents to a 13-nation Pew Research poll expressed confidence in Trump, a lower score than those accorded to Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.[742]\nAs a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks[163][159] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[746][747] His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.[746]\nTrump's false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied a total of 30,573 false or misleading statements made by Trump over his four-year term.[743] Trump's falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about six false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to 16 per day in his second year, 22 per day in his third year, and 39 per day in his final year.[748]\nSome of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his claim of the \"biggest inaugural crowd ever\".[749][750] Others had more far-reaching effects, such as his promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19 in a press conference and on Twitter.[751][752] The claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the United States and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[753][754] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served Trump's domestic political purposes.[755] As a matter of principle, Trump does not apologize for his falsehoods.[756]\nDespite the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, the media rarely referred to them as lies.[757][758] The first time The Washington Post did so was in August 2018, when it declared that some of Trump's misstatements, in particular those concerning hush money paid to Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, were lies.[759][758]\nIn 2020, Trump was a significant source of disinformation on mail-in voting and misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic.[760][761] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices served to weaken public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,[762][763] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.[455][760]\nJames Pfiffner, professor of policy and government at George Mason University, wrote in 2019 that Trump lies differently from previous presidents, because he offers \"egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well-known facts\"; these lies are the \"most important\" of all Trump lies. By calling facts into question, people will be unable to properly evaluate their government, with beliefs or policy irrationally settled by \"political power\"; this erodes liberal democracy, wrote Pfiffner.[764]\nDuring and since the 2020 presidential election, Trump has promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat including dead people voting,[771] voting machines changing or deleting Trump votes, fraudulent mail-in voting, throwing out Trump votes, and \"finding\" suitcases full of Biden votes.[772][773]\nResearch suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes.[774][775] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[776][777] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence.[778][779] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against members of minority groups.[780]\nTrump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He tweeted frequently during the 2016 election campaign and as president until Twitter banned him in the final days of his term.[781] Trump often used Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public and sidelining of the press.[782] In June 2017, a White House press secretary said that Trump's tweets were official presidential statements.[783] Trump often announced terminations of administration officials over Twitter.[784]\nAfter years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checking warnings in May 2020.[785] In response, Trump tweeted that \"Social Media Platforms totally silence conservative[] voices\" and that he would \"strongly regulate[] or close them down\".[786] In the days after the storming of the United States Capitol, Trump was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms.[787] The loss of Trump's social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[788][789] and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter.[790] Trump's early attempts to re-establish a social media presence were unsuccessful.[791] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[792]Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, reinstated Trump's Twitter account in November 2022.[793]\nTrump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love\u2013hate\" relationship with the press.[794] In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[156]The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV.\"[795]\nAs a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[796] In 2018, journalist Lesley Stahl recounted Trump's saying he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[797]\nAs president, Trump privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.[798] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[799] In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump.[800] The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[799]\nTrump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.[801] In early 2020, the Trump campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference.[802][803] Legal experts said that the lawsuits lacked merit and were not likely to succeed.[801][804] By March 2021, the lawsuits against The New York Times and CNN had been dismissed.[805][806]\nMany of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist.[807][808] In national polling, about half of respondents said that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[809][810] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[811][812] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[813]\nIn 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[49] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. As of 2019, he maintained this position.[814]\nIn 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, he became the leading proponent of the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.[815][816] In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him \"very popular\".[817][818] In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[819] In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views in private.[820]\nAccording to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist appeals to whites\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[821] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\".[822][823] His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding Trump University were also criticized as racist.[824]\nTrump answers questions from reporters about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\nIn a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[829] His remarks were condemned as racist.[830][831]\nIn July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen\u2014all from minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans\u2014should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[832] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240\u2013187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[833]White nationalist publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[834] Trump continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[835]\nTrump has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to media and on social media.[836][837] He made lewd comments, demeaned women's looks, and called them names, such as \"dog\", \"crazed\", \"crying lowlife\", \"face of a pig\", or \"horseface\".[837][838][839]\nAt least 26 women publicly accused Trump of rape, kissing, and groping without consent; looking under women's skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.[840][841][842] Trump has denied all of the allegations.[842]\nIn October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\"[843] The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign[844] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[845]\nTrump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature on television, in films, and in comics. He has been named in hundreds of hip hop songs since the 1980s\u2014until 2015, most of these references cast Trump in a positive light, but they turned largely negative after he began running for office.[846]\n^Presidential elections in the U.S. are decided by the Electoral College. Each state names a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress and (in most states) all electors vote for the winner of their state's popular vote.\n^Kumar, Anita (September 26, 2020). \"Trump's legacy is now the Supreme Court\".

        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphins%E2%80%93Patriots_rivalry#:~:text=Latest%20meeting,31%2C%20Patriots%2017",
        "context": "\nWhile not as famous as some other rivalries, the rivalry has a long history that dates back to the 1960s. The beginning of the rivalry was dominated by the Dolphins, as at the time the Dolphins were one of the NFL's most successful teams, while the Patriots were one of the worst. This trend would change during the early 2000s when the Patriots became more and more successful, eventually culminating with the Brady & Belichick dynasty, while the Dolphins, and the rest of the AFC East, would become mired in mediocrity.[2][3][4][5][6] The Patriots finally made the Super Bowl in 1985, having defeated Miami in the AFC Championship game to get there.[7]\nStarting in 1986, the rivalry was a little bit more even, with the Pats having a 7-game winning streak from 1986 to 1988. The Dolphins then took over the rivalry once again, winning 13 of the next 15 matchups between the 2 teams. Both teams had great quarterbacks in the 1990s, with the Patriots having Drew Bledsoe and the Dolphins with Dan Marino, both of whom appeared in at least one Super Bowl; Marino in Super Bowl XIX and Bledsoe in Super Bowl XXXI. The Dolphins continued to dominate the rivalry through the late 1990s with the Dolphins sweeping the Patriots in back to back years, 1999 and 2000.\nMiami is one of 3 teams in the AFC with a winning overall record against New England (the others being the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs). Since 2003, the Patriots have dominated the rivalry, but not as much as their rivalries with their two other AFC East opponents.[8][9] In 2004, one of the most famous moments in the rivalry happened where the Dolphins, 2\u201311 at the time, upset the defending champion Patriots, who were 12\u20131, in a game that has been known as \"The Night That Courage Wore Orange\".[10] The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when Nick Saban (who previously served as defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns, coached by Bill Belichick at the time) was hired as the Dolphins head coach and when he nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees with the Dolphins, as well as in 2008 when the Dolphins became the only team other than the Patriots since 2003 to win the division.[11] In Week 3 of the aforementioned 2008 season, the Dolphins used the Wildcat formation to throw the Patriots (who were without Tom Brady that year because of an ACL injury earlier in the season) off and went on to upset them, 38\u201313, snapping their 20-game regular season winning streak that dated back to December 10, 2006, which coincidentally, the Patriots were also beat by the Dolphins.[12] In 2018, the Dolphins upset the Patriots in Miami for the second year in a row, this time with a last-minute hook and lateral scoring play in what is known as the \"Miracle in Miami\".[13]\nOn February 4, 2019, the Dolphins hired a long-time Patriots assistant, Brian Flores (who had been with the team since their 2004 Super Bowl-winning season) as the 12th head coach in franchise history. In 2021, the rivalry intensified once again after the Patriots drafted Alabama quarterback Mac Jones, a former college teammate of Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, whom Jones backed up in the first half of the 2019 season until a season-ending hip injury from Tagovailoa caused Jones to take the helms at quarterback for Alabama. Both quarterbacks led Alabama to national titles in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Jones and Tagovailoa were also backups to future Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts during the 2017 season, Jones and Tagovailoa's true freshman years.[citation needed] In 2022, the Dolphins hired former Patriots wide receiver Wes Welker to be their new wide receivers coach. Welker previously played for the Dolphins from 2004\u20132006 and the hiring would reunite him with Dolphins defensive coordinator and former long-time Patriots assistant Josh Boyer, whom was serving as a defensive assistant and later the defensive backs coach during Welker's tenure with New England (2007\u20132012).\nGame in Miami was the de facto AFC East Championship Game. But due to the Jets' loss the previous day, this game ironically decided whom would finish as the #3 seed and host the loser (as the #6 seeded wild card) in the AFC Wild Card Round the following week.\nDolphins frequently use the \"Wildcat\" formation to defeat Patriots, this formation gains popularity in the league. Dolphins win AFC East, the only season the Patriots did not win the division as well as miss the playoffs from 2003\u20132019. Tom Brady did not play in either game due to a season-ending knee injury in the season opener.",

The games considered for the award are family-style games. War games, role-playing games, collectible card games, and other complicated, highly competitive, or hobbyist games are outside the scope of the award. Since 1989, there has been a separate award for children's games. The jury is not subject to public scrutiny and members of the public are not offered the opportunity to influence the voting.\nOn occasion, the jury has awarded a special prize for more complex games, such as Agricola in 2008 or World Without End in 2010. Prior to 2011, this award was an exceptional award which was not necessarily awarded annually. In 2011, however, this practice was formalized when the jury created a new category for more complex games called Kennerspiel des Jahres. Along with the nominations, the jury also gives a list of recommended games, and occasionally gives out special prizes for games which will not be considered for the main award. The criteria on which a game is evaluated are:[4]\ngame concept (originality, playability, game value)\nrule structure (composition, clearness, comprehensibility)\nlayout (box, board, rules),\ndesign (functionality, workmanship)\nThe jury does not release its scoring system or provide insight into how the categories are weighted.\nThe nominations for the 2011 awards were announced on May 23, 2011, and the winners on June 27, 2011.

        "context": "\nSuper Bowl I is the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the U.S. by two different broadcasters simultaneously. At the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game, and each network used its own announcers, but NBC was only allowed to use the CBS feed instead of producing its own.[1][2] Beginning with Super Bowl II, NBC televised the game in even years and CBS in odd years. This annual rotation between the two networks continued through the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger when NBC was given the rights to televise AFC games and CBS winning the rights to broadcast NFC games. Although ABC began broadcasting Monday Night Football in 1970, it was not added to the Super Bowl rotation until Super Bowl XIX, played in January 1985. ABC, CBS and NBC then continued to rotate the Super Bowl until 1994, when Fox replaced CBS as the NFC broadcaster. CBS then took NBC's place in the rotation after the former replaced the later as the AFC broadcaster in 1998. As a result of new contracts signed in 2006, with NBC taking over Sunday Night Football from ESPN, and Monday Night Football moving from ABC to ESPN, NBC took ABC's place in the Super Bowl rotation. The rotation between CBS, Fox, and NBC will continue until the new contracts that will take effect starting in 2024, allowing ABC to return and starting a four-network rotation.[3]\nThe four-year rotation beginning with Super Bowl LVIII also allows each broadcaster to offer simulcasts or alternative broadcasts on its sister networks and platforms.[3] CBS's sister network Nickelodeon is planning to air an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII.[4] And ABC's rights include ESPN simulcasts and alternative broadcasts on other ESPN networks.[3]\nThe NFL has broken the traditional broadcasting rotation at least twice.[5][6][7] NBC originally had broadcasting rights for Super Bowl XXVI and CBS for Super Bowl XXVII, but the NFL allowed the networks to switch the two games in order to allow CBS a significant lead-in to its coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics. Likewise, NBC was to air Super Bowl LV and CBS for Super Bowl LVI, but the two networks agreed to swap the broadcasting rights. Therefore, CBS benefitted from holding rights to the Super Bowl and the 2021 NCAA final Four, and NBC was allowed to pair its Super Bowl coverage with the 2022 Winter Olympics.[7][8] Under the four-network rotation that will take effect in 2024, the league awarded NBC the Super Bowl during Winter Olympic years.[3]\nCBS has televised the most Super Bowl games, with Super Bowl LV as its 21st.\n^Note 1 : Super Bowl I was simulcast on both CBS (at the time the sole NFL network) and NBC[23] (the AFL network). From Super Bowl II onward, the networks began rotating exclusive coverage of the game on an annual basis. Super Bowls I\u2013VI were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place.\n^Note 3 : The television contract for 1990\u20131993 had each network having one Super Bowl telecast of the first three games as part of the package. The fourth Super Bowl (XXVIII) was up for a separate sealed bid. NBC won the bid, and since they were last in the rotation for Super Bowl coverage in the regular contract, ended up with two straight Super Bowls. CBS is the only other network to televise two Super Bowls (I and II) in a row. It is also of note that Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII are the first (and to date, only) back-to-back Super Bowls to feature the same two teams (Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills).\n^Note 5 : Under the 2013 television contract, Super Bowl LV was originally assigned to NBC, while Super Bowl LVI was originally assigned to CBS. In March 2019, CBS agreed to trade Super Bowl LVI to NBC in exchange for Super Bowl LV so that the former would not have to compete against the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n^Note 6 : CBS's sister network Nickelodeon is planning to air an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII. This would mark the first time that an alternative broadcast of the game will air on the broadcaster's sister network.[4]\n1 \u2013 Dates in the list denote the season, not necessarily the calendar year in which the championship game was played. For instance, Super Bowl LIV was played in 2020, but was the championship for the 2019 season.\n2 \u2013 From 1966 to 1969, the first four Super Bowls were \"World Championship\" games played between two independent professional football leagues, AFL and NFL, and when the league merged in 1970 the Super Bowl became the NFL Championship Game.",

        "context": "\nThe agricultural Berber calendar still in use is almost certainly derived from the Julian calendar, introduced in the Roman province of Africa at the time of Roman domination. The names of the months of this calendar are derived from the corresponding Latin names and traces of the Roman calendar denominations of Kalends, Nones and Ides exist: El Qabisi, an Islamic jurisconsult by Kairawan who lived in the 11th century, condemned the custom of celebrating \"pagans'\" festivals and cited, among traditional habits of North Africa, that of observing the Qalandas (\"Kalends\") of January (1 January, i.e. the Julian New Year's Day).[2] The length of the year and of the individual months is the same as in the Julian calendar: three years of 365 days followed by a leap year of 366, without exceptions, and 30- and 31-day months, except for the second one that has 28 days. The only slight discrepancy lies in that the extra day in leap years is not usually added at the end of February, but at the end of the year. This means that the beginning of the year (the first day of yennayer) corresponds to the 14th day of January in the Gregorian calendar, which coincides with the offset accumulated during the centuries between astronomical dates and the Julian calendar.\nIn addition, some of the month names in Maltese are of Berber origin, specifically January (jannar), February (frar), May (mejju), and August (awwissu), with the others deriving from Italian. Berber and Italian month names are different enough that it is possible to easily determine the source language of each Maltese month name.\nIn addition to the subdivision by months, within the traditional agricultural calendar there are other partitions, by \"seasons\" or by \"strong periods\", characterized by particular festivals and celebrations.\nNot all the four seasons have retained a Berber denomination: the words for spring and autumn are used almost everywhere, more sparingly the winter and, among northern Berbers, the Berber name for the autumn has been preserved only in Jebel Nafusa (Libya).\nAn interesting element is the existing opposition between two 40-day terms, one representing the allegedly coldest part of winter (\"The nights\", llyali) and one the hottest period of summer (\"The Dog Days\", ssmaym, awussu).[5]\nA page from a Tunisian calendar, showing the correspondence of 1 Yennayer \u02bfajmi (in red on bottom) with 14 January of the Gregorian calendar. The writing on the bottom signals that it is \u02bfajmiNew Year's Day and that al-lyali al-sud (\"the black nights\") are beginning.\nThe coldest period is made up by 20 \"white nights\" (Berber: i\u1e0dan imellalen, Arabic: al-lyali al-bi\u1e0d), from 12 to 31 dujamber (Gregorian dates: 25 December - 13 January), and 20 \"black nights\" (Berber: i\u1e0dan tiberkanin/is\u1e6d\u1e6dafen, Arabic al-lyali al-sud), beginning on the first day of yennayer, corresponding to the Gregorian 14 January.\nThe first day of the year is celebrated in various ways in the different parts of North Africa. A widespread tradition is a meal with particular foods, which vary from region to region (such as a couscous with seven vegetables). In some regions, it is marked by the sacrifice of an animal (usually a chicken). In January 2018, Algeria declared Yennayer a national holiday \u2013 a landmark policy considering how the Amazigh are marginalized in Northern Africa.[6]\nA characteristic trait of this festivity, which often blurs with the Islamic Day of Ashura, is the presence, in many regions, of ritual invocations with formulas like bennayu, babiyyanu, bu-ini, etc. Such expressions, according to many scholars, may be derived from the ancient bonus annus (happy new year) wishes.[7]\nA curious aspect of the Yennayer celebrations concerns the date of New Year's Day. Though once this anniversary fell everywhere on 14 January,[8] because of a likely mistake introduced by some Berber cultural associations very active in recovering customs on the verge of extinction, at present in a wide part of Algeria it is common opinion that the date of \"Berber New Year's Day\" is 12 January and not the 14th. Previously the celebration at the 12, two days before the traditional one, it had been explicitly signaled in the city of Oran.[9]\nBefore the cold ends completely and spring begins fully, there is a period of the year that is very feared. It consists of ten days straddling the months of furar and mars (the last five of the former and the first five of the latter), and it is characterised by strong winds. It is said that, during this term, one should suspend many activities (agricultural and artisan), should not marry nor go out during the night, leaving instead full scope to mysterious powers, which in that period are particularly active and celebrate their weddings. Due to a linguistic taboo, in Djerba these creatures are called imbarken, i.e. \"the blessed ones\", whence this period takes its name.\nJamrat el Ma (Arabic: \u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621), \"embers of the sea\", 27 February, is marked by a rise in sea temperature.[10]\nJamrat el Trab (Arabic: \u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0628), \"land embers\" in English, is the period from 6 to 10 March and known to be marked by a mixture of heavy rain and sunny weather. The term jamrat (literally 'coal') is in reference to the warm state of the earth during this period .[11]\nLike the strong winter cold, the Dog Days also last 40 days, from 12 yulyuz (25 July) to 20 ghusht (2 September). The apical moment of the period is the first of ghusht \"August\" (also the name awussu, widespread in Tunisia and Libya, seems to date back to Latin augustus). On this date, particular rites are performed, which manifestly derive from pre-Islamic, and even pre-Christian, traditions. They consist, in particular, of bonfires (which in many locations take place around the summer solstice: a custom already condemned as Pagan by St. Augustine), or water rituals, like those, common in the coastal towns of Tunisia and Tripolitania, that provide to dive in the seawaters for three nights, in order to preserve one's health. In these ceremonies, whole families used to enter the water, bringing with them even their pets. Though the rite has been revisited in an Islamic frame (in those nights, the water of the Zamzam Well, in Mecca, would spill over, and in the sea there would be beneficial sweet water waves), many call this celebration \"the nights of the error\". It was in fact usual that, in order to achieve fertility and prosperity, men and women copulated among the flucts.\nAnother important period for the agricultural calendar is that of the ploughing. In this context, a date considered fundamental is the 17th of (k)tuber, in which one may start ploughing his fields. In Arabic, this period is called \u1e25ertadem, that is \"Adam's ploughing\", because in that date the common ancestor of humanity is said to have begun his agricultural works.\nFollowing centuries-long contacts with the Arab-Islamic culture, the celebrations linked to the Julian calendar have been sometimes integrated into the Islamic calendar, leading to the suppression of some traditional holidays or to the creation of duplicates.\nThe most evident example are the celebrations for the new year, which in many cases have been transferred to the first Islamic month, i.e. Mu\u1e25arram, and more precisely to the \u02bf\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019, which falls on the 10th day of that month. This holiday has an important mournful meaning in the Shia Islam, but it is substantially ignored among Sunnis. Many studies have shown the relationships between the joyful celebration of this holiday in North Africa and the ancient New Year's Day celebrations.\nNot much is known about the division of time among the ancient Berbers. Some elements of a pre-Islamic, and almost certainly a pre-Roman calendar, emerge from some medieval writings, analyzed by Nico van den Boogert. Some correspondences with the traditional Tuareg calendar suggest that in antiquity there existed, with some degree of diffusion, a Berber time computation, organized on native bases.\nThere are not enough elements to reconstruct this calendar fully, but known characteristics include many month names' appearing in couples (in the Tuareg world, even in triplets), which suggests a time division different from the present one, made up of months of about 30 days.\nSome further information, although difficult to specify and correlate with the situation in the rest of North Africa, may be deduced from what is known about time computation among the Guanches of the Canary Islands. According to a 17th-century manuscript by Tom\u00e1s Mar\u00edn de Cubas, they\ncomputed their year, called Acano, by lunations of 29 days (suns) beginning from the new moon. It began in summer, when the sun enters in Cancer, on June 21: at the first conjunction (at the first new moon after the Summer solstice) they celebrated nine festival days for the crop.[13]\nThe same manuscript states (although somewhat obscurely) that graphical-pictorical records of such calendarial events (tara) were made on different supports, and on this basis some modern scholars identified alleged descriptions of astronomical events connected to annual cycles in a series of geometric paintings in some caves of Gran Canaria island, but the results of these studies are for now highly speculative.[14][15]\nThe name of only one month is known in the native language, handed down as Be\u00f1esmet. It seems it was the second month of the year, corresponding to August. Such a name, in case it was made up by something like *wen \"that of\" + (e)smet (or (e)zmet?), may correspond, in the list of medieval Berber month names, with the ninth and tenth months, awzimet (properly aw \"baby of\" + zimet \"gazelle\"). But data are too scarce for this hypothesis to be deepened.[12]\nThe traditional Berber calendar was not linked to an era with respect to which years were calculated. Where traditional ways to compute the years have been preserved (Tuareg civilization), years are not expressed with numbers but each of them has a name characterizing it.\nStarting from the 1960s, however, on the initiative of the Acad\u00e9mie Berb\u00e8re of Paris, some Berbers have begun computing the years starting from 950 BC, the approximate date of the rising into power of the first Libyan Pharaoh in Egypt, Shoshenq I, whom they identified as the first prominent Berber in history (he is recorded as being of Libyan origin).[16] For example, the Gregorian year 2023 corresponds to the 2973rd year of the Berber calendar.\nThis innovation has been adopted with conviction by many supporters of the Berber culture and is now a part of the cultural heritage of this people, fully integrated in the system of traditional customs related the North-African calendar.[citation needed]\nPhoto taken on 31 December 2007 near Tafraout (Morocco), with the writings aseggas ameggaz (\"good year\") in Tifinagh and bonne ann\u00e9e 2959 (\"good year 2959\") in French. Note the 1-year mistake, as 2959 corresponds to the Gregorian year 2009.\n^The etymology proposed for bu-ini of Aures from Masqueray (1886: 164), was welcomed and extended to other similar terms related to the start of the year festivities by several authors, including Doutt\u00e9 (1909: 550), Laoust (1920: 195), Delheure (1988: 156). Drouin (2000: 115) defines these etymological research as \"unconvincing\".\n^\"In Oran the Ennayer parties are made on 11 and 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, that is two days before the common agricultural calendar ...\" Mohamed Benhadji Serradj, F\u00eates d'Enn\u00e2yer aux Beni snus (tlemc\u00e9nien folklore) in IBLA, vol. 1950, pp. 247-258.",

        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan#:~:text=2023%C2%A0date,March%20%E2%80%93%2021%20April",
        "context": "\nRamadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard \u02f9to distinguish between right and wrong\u02fa. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or on a journey, then \u02f9let them fast\u02fa an equal number of days \u02f9after Rama\u1e0d\u00e2n\u02fa. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.\nAccording to Al-Bukhari, Muhmmad initially chose the date of the fast as the day of Ashura (the 10th day of the 1st month), probably the JewishYom Kippur.[51] This fast was later replaced with the fast of the 9th month (Ramadan).[52]\nRamadan beginning dates between Gregorian years 1938 and 2038; including an error on the ante-penultimate line. This table is based on an unspecified variant of the Islamic calendar and that, according to local practices, there can be differences of one (or even two) days.\nBecause the Hil\u0101l, or crescent moon, typically occurs approximately one day after the new moon, Muslims can usually estimate the beginning of Ramadan;[53] however, many[who?] prefer to confirm the opening of Ramadan by direct visual observation of the crescent.[54]\nQadr Night is considered the holiest night of the year.[55][56] It is generally believed to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan; the Dawoodi Bohra believe that Laylat al-Qadr was the twenty-third night of Ramadan.[57][58]\nThe holiday of Eid al-Fitr (Arabic: \u0639\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0637\u0631), which marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Shawwal,[59] the next lunar month, is declared after a crescent new moon has been sighted or after completion of thirty days of fasting if no sighting of the moon is possible. Eid celebrates the return to a more natural disposition (fitra) of eating, drinking, and marital intimacy.[60]\nThe common practice is to fast from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the suhur, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is called iftar.[61]\nMuslims devote more time to prayer and acts of charity, striving to improve their self-discipline, motivated by hadith:[62][63] \"When Ramadan arrives, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of hell are locked up and devils are put in chains.\"[64]\nRamadan is a time of spiritual reflection, self-improvement, and heightened devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (sawm) begins at dawn and ends at sunset. In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking during this time, Muslims abstain from sexual relations[3] and sinful speech and behaviour during Ramadan fasting or month. The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, its purpose being to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Muslims believe that Ramadan teaches them to practice self-discipline, self-control,[65] sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate, thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity (zakat).[66] Muslims also believe fasting helps instill compassion for the food-insecure poor.\nExemptions from fasting include those traveling, menstruating, severely ill, pregnant, or breastfeeding. However, Muslims in these categories may still choose to fast, in order to satisfy their spiritual needs, even though it is not recommended by hadith.[61] Those unable to fast are obligated to make up the missed days later.[67]\nAt sunset, families break the fast with the iftar, traditionally opening the meal by eating dates to commemorate Muhammad's practice of breaking the fast with three dates.[70][71] They then adjourn for Maghrib, the fourth of the five required daily prayers, after which the main meal is served.[72]\nSocial gatherings, many times in buffet style, are frequent at iftar. Traditional dishes are often highlighted, including traditional desserts, particularly those made only during Ramadan.[example needed] Water is usually the beverage of choice, but juice and milk are also often available, as are soft drinks and caffeinated beverages.[73]\nIn the Middle East, iftar consists of water, juices, dates, salads and appetizers; one or more main dishes; and rich desserts, with dessert considered the most important aspect of the meal.[74] Typical main dishes include lamb stewed with wheat berries, lamb kebabs with grilled vegetables, and roasted chicken served with chickpea-studded rice pilaf. Desserts may include luqaimat, baklava or kunafeh.[75]\nZakat, often translated as \"the poor-rate\", is the fixed percentage of income a believer is required to give to the poor; the practice is obligatory as one of the pillars of Islam. Muslims believe that good deeds are rewarded more handsomely during Ramadan than at any other time of the year; consequently, many Muslims donate a larger portion \u2013 or even all \u2013 of their yearly zak\u0101t during this month.[citation needed]\nTarawih (Arabic: \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a\u062d) are extra nightly prayers performed during the month of Ramadan. Contrary to popular belief, they are not compulsory.[78]\nMuslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran, which comprises thirty juz' (sections), over the thirty days of Ramadan. Some Muslims incorporate a recitation of one juz' into each of the thirty tarawih sessions observed during the month.[citation needed]\nOn the island of Java, many believers bathe in holy springs to prepare for fasting, a ritual known as Padusan.[83] The city of Semarang marks the beginning of Ramadan with the Dugderan carnival, which involves parading the warak ngendog, a horse-dragon hybrid creature allegedly inspired by the Buraq.[84] In the Chinese-influenced capital city of Jakarta, firecrackers are widely used to celebrate Ramadan, although they are officially illegal.[85] Towards the end of Ramadan, most employees receive a one-month bonus known as Tunjangan Hari Raya.[86] Certain kinds of food are especially popular during Ramadan, such as large beef or buffalo in Aceh and snails in Central Java.[87] The iftar meal is announced every evening by striking the bedug, a giant drum, in the mosque.[88]\nCommon greetings during Ramadan include Ramadan mubarak and Ramadan kareem, which mean (have a) \"blessed Ramadan\" and \"generous Ramadan\" respectively.[89]\nDuring Ramadan in the Middle East, a mesaharati beats a drum across a neighbourhood to wake people up to eat the suhoor meal. Similarly in Southeast Asia, the kentonganslit drum is used for the same purpose.\nIn some countries, on the contrary, the observance of Ramadan has been restricted by governments. In the USSR, the practice of Ramadan was suppressed by officials.[105][106] In Albania, Ramadan festivities were banned during the communist period.[107] However, many Albanians continued to fast secretly during this period.[108]\nSome countries impose modified work schedules. In the UAE, employees may work no more than six hours per day and thirty-six hours per week. Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait have similar laws.[118]\nThere are various health effects of fasting in Ramadan. Ramadan fasting is considered safe for healthy individuals; it may pose risks for individuals with certain pre-existing conditions. Most Islamic scholars hold that fasting is not required for those who are ill. Additionally, the elderly and pre-pubertal children are exempt from fasting.[119] Pregnant or lactating women are also exempt from fasting during Ramadan.[120] There are known health risks involved in pregnant women who fast, which include the potential of induced labour and gestational diabetes.[121][122][123][124][125]\nThere are some health benefits of fasting in Ramadan including increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing insulin resistance.[126] It has also been shown that there is a significant improvement in 10 years coronary heart disease risk score and other cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids profile, systolic blood pressure, weight, BMI and waist circumference in subjects with a previous history of cardiovascular disease.[127] The fasting period is usually associated with modest weight loss, but weight can return afterwards.[128]\nIn many cultures, it is associated with heavy food and water intake during Suhur and Iftar times, which may do more harm than good.[129] Ramadan fasting is safe for healthy people provided that overall food and water intake is adequate but those with medical conditions should seek medical advice if they encounter health problems before or during fasting.[130]\nThe education departments of Berlin and the United Kingdom have tried to discourage students from fasting during Ramadan, as they claim that not eating or drinking can lead to concentration problems and bad grades.[131][132]\nConversion of Hijri years 1343 to 1500 to the Gregorian calendar, with first days of al-Muharram (brown), Ramadan (grey) and Shawwal (black) bolded, and Eid al-Adha dotted \u2013 in the SVG file, hover over a spot to show its dates and a line to show the month\nA study on 55 professional Algerian soccer players showed that performance during Ramadan declined significantly for speed, agility, dribbling speed and endurance, and most stayed low 2 weeks after the conclusion of Ramadan.[134]\nThe length of the dawn to sunset time varies in different parts of the world according to summer or winter solstices of the Sun. Most Muslims fast for eleven to sixteen hours during Ramadan. However, in polar regions, the period between dawn and sunset may exceed twenty-two hours in summer. For example, in 2014, Muslims in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Trondheim, Norway, fasted almost twenty-two hours, while Muslims in Sydney, Australia, fasted for only about eleven hours. In areas characterized by continuous night or day, some Muslims follow the fasting schedule observed in the nearest city that experiences sunrise and sunset, while others follow Mecca time.[19][20][21]\nAs sunrise and sunset occur sixteen times each a day in low-Earth orbit, Muslim astronauts in space schedule religious practices around the time zone of the last place on Earth they were on. For example, this means an astronaut from Malaysia launching from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida would center their fast according to sunrise and sunset times in Cape Canaveral, in Florida's Eastern Time. This includes times for daily prayers, as well as sunset and sunrise for Ramadan.[135][136]\nMuslims continue to work during Ramadan;[137][138] however, in some countries, such as Oman and Lebanon, working hours are shortened.[139][140] It is often recommended that working Muslims inform their employers if they are fasting, given the potential for the observance to impact performance at work.[141] The extent to which Ramadan observers are protected by religious accommodation varies by country. Policies putting them at a disadvantage compared to other employees have been met with discrimination claims in the United Kingdom and the United States.[142][143][144] An Arab News article reported that Saudi Arabian businesses were unhappy with shorter working hours during Ramadan, some reporting a decline in productivity of 35\u201350%.[145] The Saudi businesses proposed awarding salary bonuses in order to incentivize longer hours.[146] Despite the reduction in productivity, merchants can enjoy higher profit margins in Ramadan due to increase in demand.[147]",

It was built using the technologies Apple acquired from NeXT, but did not include the signature Aqua user interface (UI). The desktop version aimed at regular users\u2014Mac OS X 10.0\u2014shipped in March 2001. Since then, several more distinct desktop and server editions of macOS have been released. Starting with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, macOS Server is no longer offered as a standalone operating system; instead, server management tools are available for purchase as an add-on. The macOS Server app was discontinued on April 21, 2022 and will stop working on macOS 13 Ventura or later. Starting with the Intel build of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, most releases have been certified as Unix systems conforming to the Single UNIX Specification.[2][3][4][5][6]\nLion was referred to by Apple as \"Mac OS X Lion\" and sometimes as \"OS X Lion\"; Mountain Lion was officially referred to as just \"OS X Mountain Lion\", with the \"Mac\" being completely dropped. The operating system was further renamed to \"macOS\" starting with macOS Sierra.\nFrom the introduction of machines not supporting the classic Mac OS in 2003 until the introduction of iPhone OS in early 2007, Mac OS X was Apple's only software platform.\nmacOS retained the major version number 10 throughout its development history until the release of macOS 11 Big Sur in 2020.\nMac OS X 10.0 and 10.1 were given names of big cats as internal code names (\"Cheetah\" and \"Puma\"). Starting with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, big cat names were used as marketing names; starting with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, names of locations in California were used as marketing names instead.\nThe current major version, macOS 14 Sonoma, was announced on June 5, 2023 at WWDC 2023 and released on September 26 of that year.\nIt was updated to macOS 14.1 Sonoma on the 2nd of November that same year.\nA diagram of the relationships between Unix systems including the ancestors of macOS\nAfter Apple removed Steve Jobs from management in 1985, he left the company and attempted to create the \"next big thing\", with funding from Ross Perot[7] and himself. The result was the NeXT Computer. As the first workstation to include a digital signal processor (DSP) and a high-capacity optical disc drive, NeXT hardware was advanced for its time, but was expensive relative to the rapidly commoditizing workstation market. The hardware was phased out in 1993; however, the company's object-oriented operating systemNeXTSTEP had a more lasting legacy as it eventually became the basis for Mac OS X.\nAll but abandoning the idea of an operating system, NeXT managed to maintain a business selling WebObjects and consulting services, only ever making modest profits in its last few quarters as an independent company. NeXTSTEP underwent an evolution into OPENSTEP which separated the object layers from the operating system below, allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms. OPENSTEP was, for a short time, adopted by Sun and HP.\nHowever, by this point, a number of other companies \u2014 notably Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and even Sun itself \u2014 were claiming they would soon be releasing similar object-oriented operating systems and development tools of their own. Some of these efforts, such as Taligent, did not fully come to fruition; others, like Java, gained widespread adoption.[citation needed]\nOn February 4, 1997, Apple Computer acquired NeXT for $427 million, and used OPENSTEP as the basis for Mac OS X, as it was called at the time.[9] Traces of the NeXT software heritage can still be seen in macOS. For example, in the Cocoa development environment, the Objective-C library classes have \"NS\" prefixes, and the HISTORY section of the manual page for the defaults command in macOS straightforwardly states that the command \"First appeared in NeXTStep.\"[citation needed]\nMeanwhile, Apple was facing commercial difficulties of its own. The decade-old Macintosh System Software had reached the limits of its single-user, co-operative multitasking architecture, and its once-innovative user interface was looking increasingly outdated. A massive development effort to replace it, known as Copland, was started in 1994, but was generally perceived outside Apple to be a hopeless case due to political infighting and conflicting goals. By 1996, Copland was nowhere near ready for release, and the project was eventually cancelled. Some elements of Copland were incorporated into Mac OS 8, released on July 26, 1997.\nAfter considering the purchase of BeOS \u2014 a multimedia-enabled, multi-tasking OS designed for hardware similar to Apple's, the company decided instead to acquire NeXT and use OPENSTEP as the basis for their new OS. Avie Tevanian took over OS development, and Steve Jobs was brought on as a consultant. At first, the plan was to develop a new operating system based almost entirely on an updated version of OPENSTEP, with the addition of a virtual machine subsystem \u2014 known as the Blue Box \u2014 for running \"classic\" Macintosh applications. The result was known by the code name Rhapsody, slated for release in late 1998.\nApple expected that developers would port their software to the considerably more powerful OPENSTEP libraries once they learned of its power and flexibility. Instead, several major developers such as Adobe told Apple that this would never occur, and that they would rather leave the platform entirely. This \"rejection\" of Apple's plan was largely the result of a string of previous broken promises from Apple; after watching one \"next OS\" after another disappear and Apple's market share dwindle, developers were not interested in doing much work on the platform at all, let alone a re-write.\nApple's financial losses continued and the board of directors lost confidence in CEO Gil Amelio, asking him to resign. The board asked Steve Jobs to lead the company on an interim basis, essentially giving him carte blanche to make changes to return the company to profitability. When Jobs announced at the World Wide Developer's Conference that what developers really wanted was a modern version of the Mac OS, and Apple was going to deliver it[citation needed], he was met with applause.\nOver the next two years, a major effort was applied to porting the original Macintosh API to Unix libraries known as Carbon. Mac OS applications could be ported to Carbon without the need for a complete re-write, making them operate as native applications on the new operating system. Meanwhile, applications written using the older toolkits would be supported using the \"Classic\" Mac OS 9 environment. Support for C, C++, Objective-C, Java, and Python were added, furthering developer comfort with the new platform.[citation needed]\nDuring this time, the lower layers of the operating system (the Mach kernel and the BSD layers on top of it[10]) were re-packaged and released under the Apple Public Source License. They became known as Darwin. The Darwin kernel provides a stable and flexible operating system, which takes advantage of the contributions of programmers and independent open-source projects outside Apple; however, it sees little use outside the Macintosh community.[citation needed]\nDuring this period, the Java programming language had increased in popularity, and an effort was started to improve Mac Java support. This consisted of porting a high-speed Java virtual machine to the platform, and exposing macOS-specific \"Cocoa\" APIs to the Java language.[citation needed]\nThe first release of the new OS \u2014 Mac OS X Server 1.0 \u2014 used a modified version of the Mac OS GUI, but all client versions starting with Mac OS X Developer Preview 3 used a new theme known as Aqua. Aqua was a substantial departure from the Mac OS 9 interface, which had evolved with little change from that of the original Macintosh operating system: it incorporated full color scalable graphics, anti-aliasing of text and graphics, simulated shading and highlights, transparency and shadows, and animation. A new feature was the Dock, an application launcher which took advantage of these capabilities.\nDespite this, Mac OS X maintained a substantial degree of consistency with the traditional Mac OS interface and Apple's own Apple Human Interface Guidelines, with its pull-down menu at the top of the screen, familiar keyboard shortcuts, and support for a single-button mouse. The development of Aqua was delayed somewhat by the switch from OpenStep's Display PostScript engine to one developed in-house that was free of any license restrictions, known as Quartz.[citation needed]\nAfter the code name \"Jaguar\" for version 10.2 received publicity in the media, Apple began openly using the names to promote the operating system: 10.3 was marketed as \"Panther\", 10.4 as \"Tiger\", 10.5 as \"Leopard\", 10.6 as \"Snow Leopard\", 10.7 as \"Lion\", and 10.8 as \"Mountain Lion\". \"Panther\", \"Tiger\", and \"Leopard\" were registered as trademarks.\nIn 2016, OS X was renamed to macOS. A few years later, in 2020, with the release of macOS Big Sur, the first component of the version number was incremented from 10 to 11, so Big Sur's initial release's version number was 11.0 instead of 10.16, making the version numbers of macOS behave the way the version numbers of Apple's other operating systems do.[35] All subsequent major releases also increased the first component of the version number.\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95[36] \"preview\" version of Mac OS X (internally codenamed Kodiak) in order to gain feedback from users.[37] It marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface, and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in spring 2001.[38]\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).[39]\nThe initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.\nMac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released on September 25, 2001.[40]\nIt has better performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users. Apple released a US$129 upgrade CD for Mac OS 9.\nOn January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[41]\nOn August 23, 2002,[42]\nApple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.[43]\nIt brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple[44]\n), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATIRadeon or NvidiaGeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16 MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[45]\nThe Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X 10.2.\nOn January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel x86-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.[48] 10.4.4 introduced Rosetta, which translated 32-bit PowerPC machine code to 32-bit x86 code, allowing applications for PowerPC to run on Intel-based Macs without modification.\nOnly PowerPC Macs can be booted from retail copies of the Tiger client DVD, but there is a Universal DVD of Tiger Server 10.4.7 (8K1079) that can boot both PowerPC and Intel Macs.\nMac OS X Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. Apple called it \"the largest update of Mac OS X\". Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for Macs with the G3 processor was dropped, and Macs with the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867 MHz and at least 512 MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed,[49] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features.\nLeopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.[2][50] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications,[51] and was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.\nMac OS X Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009, the last version to be available on disc. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, the development of Snow Leopard was deliberately focused on \"under the hood\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes are these: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean installation compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser.[52]\nAn update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications and subsequent macOS upgrades.[52] Snow Leopard only supports Macs with Intel CPUs, requires at least 1 GB of RAM, and drops default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta can be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[53]\nMac OS X Lion (also known as OS X Lion) was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications (Launchpad) and (a greater use of) multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incapable of running PowerPC applications. It dropped support for 32-bit Intel processors and requires 2GB of memory. Changes made to the GUI (Graphical User Interface) include the Launchpad (similar to the home screen of iOS and iPadOS devices), auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control, which unifies Expos\u00e9, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[54]\nApple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed (similar to iOS). Documents auto-save by default.\nOS X Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud. 2GB of memory is required.[55] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features, including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine.[56]Notification Center is added, providing an overview of alerts from applications. Notes is added, as an application separate from Mail, synching with its iOS counterpart[57][58] through the iCloud service. Messages, an instant messagingsoftware application,[59] replaces iChat.[60]\nOS X Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013, as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide.[61]\nIt placed emphasis on battery life, Finder enhancements, other enhancements for power users, and continued iCloud integration, as well as bringing more of Apple's iOS apps to the OS X platform. iBooks and Apple Maps applications were added. Mavericks requires 2GB of memory to operate. It is the first version named under Apple's then-new theme of places in California, dubbed Mavericks after the surfing location.[62][63] Unlike previous versions of OS X, which had progressively decreasing prices since 10.6, 10.9 was available at no charge to all users of compatible systems running Snow Leopard (10.6) or later,[64] beginning Apple's policy of free upgrades for life on its operating system and business software.[65]\nOS X Yosemite was released to the general public on October 16, 2014, as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide. It featured a major overhaul of user interface, replaced skeuomorphism with flat graphic design and blurred translucency effects, following the aesthetic introduced with iOS 7. It introduced features called Continuity and Handoff, which allow for tighter integration between paired OS X and iOS devices: the user can handle phone calls or text messages on either their Mac or their iPhone, and edit the same Pages document on either their Mac or their iPad. A later update of the OS included Photos as a replacement for iPhoto and Aperture.[citation needed]\nOS X El Capitan was revealed on June 8, 2015, during the WWDC15 keynote speech.[66] It was made available as a public beta in July and was made available publicly on September 30, 2015. Apple described this release as containing \"Refinements to the Mac Experience\" and \"Improvements to System Performance\" rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, as well as adopting San Francisco as the system font. Metal API, an application enhancing software, had debuted in this operating system, being available to \"all Macs since 2012\".[67]\nmacOS Sierra was announced on June 13, 2016, during the WWDC16 keynote speech. The update brought the Siri assistant to macOS, featuring several Mac-specific features, like searching for files. It also allowed websites to support Apple Pay as a method of transferring payment, using either a nearby iOS device or Touch ID to authenticate. iCloud also received several improvements, such as the ability to store a user's Desktop and Documents folders on iCloud so they could be synced with other Macs on the same Apple ID. It was released publicly on September 20, 2016.[68]\nmacOS High Sierra was announced on June 5, 2017, during the WWDC17 keynote speech. It was released on September 25, 2017. The release includes many under-the-hood improvements, including a switch to Apple File System (APFS), the introduction of Metal 2, support for HEVC video, and improvements to VR support. In addition, numerous changes were made to standard applications including Photos, Safari, Notes, and Spotlight.[69]\nmacOS Mojave was announced on June 4, 2018, during the WWDC18 keynote speech. It was released on September 24, 2018. Some of the key new features were Dark wallpaper in dark mode, Desktop stacks and Dynamic Desktop, which changes the desktop background image to correspond to the user's current time of day.[70]\nmacOS Catalina was announced on June 3, 2019, during the WWDC19 keynote speech. It was released on October 7, 2019. It primarily focuses on updates to built-in apps, such as replacing iTunes with separate Music, Podcasts, and TV apps, redesigned Reminders and Books apps, and a new Find My app. It also features Sidecar, which allows the user to use an iPad as a second screen for their computer, or even simulate a graphics tablet with an Apple Pencil. It is the first version of macOS not to support 32-bit applications. The Dashboard application was also removed in the update.[71][72] Since macOS Catalina, iOS apps can run on macOS with Project Catalyst but requires the app to be made compatible[73] unlike ARM-powered Apple silicon Macs that can run all iOS apps by default.[74]\nmacOS Big Sur was announced on June 22, 2020, during the WWDC20 keynote speech.[75] It was released November 12, 2020.[76] The major version number is changed, for the first time since \"Mac OS X\" was released, making it macOS 11. It brings ARM support, new icons, GUI changes to the system,[77] and other bug fixes.\nSince macOS 11.2.3, it is no longer possible to install iOS apps by default from an IPA file instead of the Mac App Store on Apple silicon Macs, which now requires third-party software to unlock the functionality.[78][79] Big Sur introduced Rosetta 2 to allow 64-bit Intel applications to run on Apple silicon Macs. However, Intel-based Macs are unable to run ARM-based applications, including iOS and iPadOS apps.\nmacOS Monterey was announced on June 7, 2021, during the WWDC21 keynote speech.[80] It was released on October 25, 2021.[81] macOS Monterey introduces new features such as Universal Control, which allows users to use a single keyboard and mouse to move between devices; AirPlay, which now allows users to present and share almost anything; the Shortcuts app, also introduced to macOS, gives users access to galleries of pre-built shortcuts, designed for Macs, a service brought from iOS, and users can now also set up shortcuts, among other things.[82] macOS Monterey is the final version of macOS that officially supports macOS Server.\nmacOS Ventura was announced on June 6, 2022, during the WWDC22 keynote speech.[83] It was released on October 24, 2022.[84] macOS Ventura introduces Stage Manager, a new and optional window manager, a redesigned settings app, and Continuity Camera, which is a program that allows Mac users to use their iPhone as a camera, and several other new features.[83] It is also the first version of macOS without macOS Server support.\nmacOS Sonoma was announced on June 5, 2023, during the WWDC23 keynote speech. Key changes include a revamp of Widgets, the user lock screen, and a video wallpaper/screensaver feature using Apple TV's screen saver videos.[85] It was released on September 26, 2023.[86]\n^Trademark #78257226 for Panther, #78269988 for Tiger, #78270003 for Leopard, #78271630 for Cougar and #78271639 for Lynx, all registered in 2004 by Apple Computer, Inc.\n\"United States Patent and Trademark Office\".

        "question": "How many exoplanets have been discovered?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_exoplanets#:~:text=5%2C539%20confirmed%20exoplanets",
        "context": "\nThe convention for naming exoplanets is an extension of the system used for designating multiple-star systems as adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). For exoplanets orbiting a single star, the IAU designation is formed by taking the designated or proper name of its parent star, and adding a lower case letter.[3] Letters are given in order of each planet's discovery around the parent star, so that the first planet discovered in a system is designated \"b\" (the parent star is considered \"a\") and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the designation of circumbinary planets. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.\nPlanets are extremely faint compared to their parent stars. For example, a Sun-like star is about a billion times brighter than the reflected light from any exoplanet orbiting it. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore, the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge which requires extreme optothermal stability.[4] All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than Jupiter) and widely separated from their parent stars.\nSpecially designed direct-imaging instruments such as Gemini Planet Imager, VLT-SPHERE, and SCExAO will image dozens of gas giants, but the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods.\nWhen the star is behind a planet, its brightness will seem to dimIf a planet crosses (or transits) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other factors. Because the transit method requires that the planet's orbit intersect a line-of-sight between the host star and Earth, the probability that an exoplanet in a randomly oriented orbit will be observed to transit the star is somewhat small. The Kepler telescope used this method.\nAs a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocity\u2014that is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from Earth\u2014can be detected from displacements in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. Extremely small radial-velocity variations can be observed, of 1 m/s or even somewhat less.[6]\nWhen multiple planets are present, each one slightly perturbs the others' orbits. Small variations in the times of transit for one planet can thus indicate the presence of another planet, which itself may or may not transit. For example, variations in the transits of the planet Kepler-19b suggest the existence of a second planet in the system, the non-transiting Kepler-19c.[7][8]\nWhen a planet orbits multiple stars or if the planet has moons, its transit time can significantly vary per transit. Although no new planets or moons have been discovered with this method, it is used to successfully confirm many transiting circumbinary planets.[9]\nMicrolensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing star can cause detectable anomalies in magnification as it varies over time. Unlike most other methods which have a detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, the microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1\u201310 AU away from Sun-like stars.\nAstrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky and observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion is so small, however, this method has not yet been very productive. It has produced only a few disputed detections, though it has been successfully used to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.\nA pulsar (the small, ultradense remnant of a star that has exploded as a supernova) emits radio waves extremely regularly as it rotates. If planets orbit the pulsar, they will cause slight anomalies in the timing of its observed radio pulses. The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.\nLike pulsars, there are some other types of stars which exhibit periodic activity. Deviations from periodicity can sometimes be caused by a planet orbiting it. As of 2013, a few planets have been discovered with this method.[10]\nWhen a planet orbits very close to a star, it catches a considerable amount of starlight. As the planet orbits the star, the amount of light changes due to planets having phases from Earth's viewpoint or planets glowing more from one side than the other due to temperature differences.[11]\nWith the polarimetry method, a polarized light reflected off the planet is separated from unpolarized light emitted from the star. No new planets have been discovered with this method, although a few already discovered planets have been detected with this method.[14][15]\nDisks of space dust surround many stars, thought to originate from collisions among asteroids and comets. The dust can be detected because it absorbs starlight and re-emits it as infrared radiation. Features on the disks may suggest the presence of planets, though this is not considered a definitive detection method.",

        "context": "\nNew England and Virginia colonists originally celebrated days of fasting, as well as days of thanksgiving, thanking God for blessings such as harvests, ship landings, military victories, or the end of a drought.[4] These were observed through church services, accompanied with feasts and other communal gatherings.[3][b]\nThe event that Americans commonly call the \"first Thanksgiving\" was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in October 1621.[5] This feast lasted three days and was attended by 90 Native American Wampanoag people[6][c]\nand 53 survivors of the Mayflower (Pilgrims).[7] Less widely known is an earlier Thanksgiving celebration in Virginia in 1619 by English settlers who had just landed at Berkeley Hundred aboard the ship Margaret.[8]\nThanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, with a proclamation by President George Washington after a request by Congress.[9] President Thomas Jefferson chose not to observe the holiday, and its celebration was intermittent until President Abraham Lincoln, in 1863, proclaimed a national day of \"Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens\", calling on the American people to also, \"with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience ... fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation\". Lincoln declared it for the last Thursday in November.[10][11] On June 28, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Holidays Act that made Thanksgiving a yearly appointed federal holiday in Washington, D.C.[12][13][14] On January 6, 1885, an act by Congress made Thanksgiving, and other federal holidays, a paid holiday for all federal workers throughout the United States.[15] Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the date was moved to one week earlier, observed between 1939 and 1941 amid significant controversy. From 1942 onwards, Thanksgiving, by an act of Congress received a permanent observation date, the fourth Thursday in November, no longer at the discretion of the president.[16][17]\nShrine of the first U.S. Thanksgiving in 1619 at Berkeley Plantation in Charles City County, Virginia\nSetting aside time to give thanks for one's blessings, along with holding feasts to celebrate a harvest, are both practices that long predate the European settlement of North America. The Puritans observed days of fasting to pray for God's favor, as well as days of thanksgiving to thank God for a bountiful harvest, victory and other joyous occasions.[3] Documented thanksgiving services in territory currently belonging to the United States were conducted in the 16th century by Spaniards[18][19] and the French.[20] These days of thanksgiving were celebrated through church services and feasting.[3] Historian Michael Gannon claimed St. Augustine, Florida, was founded with a shared thanksgiving meal on September 8, 1565.[21]\nThanksgiving services were routine in what became the Commonwealth of Virginia as early as 1607;[22] the first permanent settlement of Jamestown, Virginia, held a thanksgiving in 1610.[18] On December 4, 1619, 38 English settlers celebrated a thanksgiving immediately upon landing at Berkeley Hundred in Charles City County, Virginia. The group's London Company charter specifically required \"that the day of our ships arrival at the place assigned for plantation in the land of Virginia shall be yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God\".[8][23] This celebration has, since the mid 20th century, been commemorated there annually at present-day Berkeley Plantation, the ancestral home of the Harrison family of Virginia.[24]\nThe Plymouth settlers, known as Pilgrims, had settled in a land abandoned when all but one of the Patuxet Indians died in a disease outbreak. After a harsh winter killed half of the Plymouth settlers, the last surviving Patuxet, Tisquantum, more commonly known by the diminutive variant Squanto (who had learned English and avoided the plague as a slave in Europe), came in at the request of Samoset, the first Native American to encounter the Pilgrims. Squanto taught the Pilgrims how to catch eel and grow corn and served as an interpreter for them until he too succumbed to the disease a year later. The Wampanoag leader Massasoit also gave food to the colonists during the first winter when supplies brought from England were insufficient. Massasoit had hoped to establish an alliance between the Wampanoag, themselves greatly weakened by the same plague that extirpated the Patuxet, and the better-armed English in their long-running rivalry with a Narragansett tribe that had largely been spared from the epidemic; the tribe reasoned that, given that the Pilgrims had brought women and children, they had not arrived to wage war against them.[26]\nThe Pilgrims celebrated at Plymouth for three days after their first harvest in 1621. The exact time is unknown, but James Baker, the Plimoth Plantation vice president of research, stated in 1996, \"The event occurred between Sept. 21 and Nov. 11, 1621, with the most likely time being around Michaelmas (Sept. 29), the traditional time.\"[27] Seventeenth-century accounts do not identify this as a Thanksgiving observance, rather it followed the harvest. It included 50 people who were on the Mayflower (all who remained of the 100 who had landed) and 90 Native Americans.[27] The feast was cooked by the four adult Pilgrim women who survived their first winter in the New World (Eleanor Billington, Elizabeth Hopkins, Mary Brewster, and Susanna White), along with young daughters and male and female servants.[27][28] According to accounts by Wampanoag descendants, the harvest was originally set up for the Pilgrims alone; the surviving natives, hearing celebratory gunfire and fearing war, arrived to see the feast and were warmly welcomed to join the celebration, contributing their own foods to the meal.[26]\nThe Puritan by Augustus St. Gaudens, 1904. The \"buckle hat\" atop the sculpture's head, now associated with the Pilgrims in pop culture, was fictional; Pilgrims never wore such an item, nor has any such hat ever existed as a serious piece of apparel.\nThey began now to gather in the small harvest they had, and to fit up their houses and dwellings against winter, being all well recovered in health and strength and had all things in good plenty. For as some were thus employed in affairs abroad, others were exercised in fishing, about cod and bass and other fish, of which they took good store, of which every family had their portion. All the summer there was no want; and now began to come in store of fowl, as winter approached, of which this place did abound when they can be used (but afterward decreased by degrees). And besides waterfowl, there was a great store of wild turkeys, of which they took many, besides venison, etc. Besides, they had about a peck a meal a week to a person, or now since harvest, Indian corn to the proportion. Which made many afterward write so largely of their plenty here to their friends in England, which were not feigned but true reports.[32]\nOur harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the fruits of our labor. They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company almost a week. At which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised our arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest their greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three days we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five deer, which we brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor, and upon the captain and others. And although it be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with us, yet by the goodness of God, we are so far from want that we often wish you, partakers of our plenty.[33]\nThe First Thanksgiving 1621, oil on canvas by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris (1899). The painting shows common misconceptions about the event which persist to modern times: Pilgrims did not wear such outfits, nor did they eat at a dinner table, and the Wampanoag are dressed in the style of Native Americans from the Great Plains.[34]\nThe Pilgrims held a true Thanksgiving celebration in 1623[35][36] following a fast[37] and a refreshing 14 day rain,[38] which resulted in a larger harvest. William DeLoss Love calculates that this thanksgiving was made on Wednesday, July 30, 1623, a day before the arrival of a supply ship with more colonists,[37] but before the fall harvest. In Love's opinion, this 1623 thanksgiving was significant because the order to recognize the event was from civil authority[39]\n(Governor Bradford), and not from the church, making it likely the first civil recognition of Thanksgiving in New England.[37]\nReferring to the 1623 harvest after the nearly catastrophic drought, Bradford wrote:\nAnd afterward, the Lord sent them such seasonable showers, with the interchange of fair warm weather as, through His blessing, caused a fruitful and liberal harvest, to their no small comfort and rejoicing. For which mercy, in time convenient, they also set apart a day of thanksgiving ... By this time harvest was come, and instead of famine now God gave them plenty ... for which they blessed God. And the effect of their particular planting was well seen, for all had ... pretty well ... so as any general want or famine had not been amongst them since to this day.[40]\nThese firsthand accounts do not appear to have contributed to the early development of the holiday. Bradford's \"Of Plymouth Plantation\" was not published until the 1850s. The booklet \"Mourt's Relation\" was summarized by other publications without the now-familiar thanksgiving story. By the eighteenth century, the original booklet appeared to be lost or forgotten; a copy was rediscovered in Philadelphia in 1820, with the first full reprinting in 1841. In a footnote the editor, Alexander Young, was the first person to identify the 1621 feast as the first Thanksgiving.[41]\nAccording to historian James Baker, debates over where any \"first Thanksgiving\" took place on modern American territory are a \"tempest in a beanpot\".[41] Jeremy Bang opines that, \"Local boosters in Virginia, Florida, and Texas promote their own colonists, who (like many people getting off a boat) gave thanks for setting foot again on dry land.\"[42] According to Baker, \"the American holiday's true origin was the New England Calvinist Thanksgiving. Never coupled with a Sabbath meeting, the Puritan observances were special days set aside during the week for thanksgiving and praise in response to God's providence.\"[41]\nPolitically, the 1619 codification and celebration of an annual thanksgiving according to the Berkeley Hundred charter in Virginia prompted President John F. Kennedy to acknowledge the claims of both Massachusetts and Virginia to America's earliest celebrations. He issued Proclamation 3560 on November 5, 1963, saying: \"Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massachusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of thanksgiving. On the appointed day, they gave reverent thanks for their safety, for the health of their children, for the fertility of their fields, for the love which bound them together and for the faith which united them with their God.\"[43]\nThe Wampanoag were collaboratively active in the first historical Thanksgiving dinner with the Pilgrims. Different accounts of the Thanksgiving meal exist from that the time. \"While the celebrants might well have feasted on wild turkey, the local diet also included fish, eels, shellfish, and a Wampanoag dish called nasaump, which the Pilgrims had adopted: boiled cornmeal mixed with vegetables and meats. There were no potatoes (an indigenous South American food not yet introduced into the global food system) and no pies (because there was no butter, wheat flour, or sugar).\".[44]\nThe Wampanoag tribe has aligned what they eat with tradition, nature, and time of the season.[45] Their farming and hunting techniques produced much of the dinner for the Pilgrims at the time, but they had a separate notion. Much of today's image and literary text promotes the idea that every party involved ate solely turkey.[46]\nThe First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving was given by the Continental Congress in 1777 from its temporary location in York, Pennsylvania, while the British occupied the national capital at Philadelphia. Delegate Samuel Adams created the first draft. Congress then adopted the final version:\nFor as much as it is the indispensable Duty of all Men to adore the superintending Providence of Almighty God; to acknowledge with Gratitude their Obligation to him for Benefits received, and to implore such farther Blessings as they stand in Need of: And it had pleased him in his abundant Mercy, not only to continue to us the innumerable Bounties of his common Providence; but also to smile upon us in the Prosecution of a just and necessary war, for the Defense and Establishment of our unalienable Rights and Liberties; particularly in that he hath been pleased, in so great a Measure, to prosper the Means used for the Support of our Troops, and to crown our Arms with most signal success:\nIt is therefore recommended to the legislative or executive Powers of these United States to set apart Thursday, the eighteenth Day of December next, for Solemn Thanksgiving and Praise: That at one Time and with one Voice, the good People may express the grateful Feelings of their Hearts, and consecrate themselves to the Service of their Divine Benefactor; and that, together with their sincere Acknowledgments and Offerings, they may join the penitent Confession of their manifold Sins, whereby they had forfeited every Favor; and their humble and earnest Supplication that it may please God through the Merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of Remembrance; That it may please him graciously to afford his Blessing on the Governments of these States respectively, and prosper the public Council of the whole: To inspire our Commanders, both by Land and Sea, and all under them, with that Wisdom and Fortitude which may render them fit Instruments, under the Providence of Almighty God, to secure for these United States, the greatest of all human Blessings, Independence and Peace: That it may please him, to prosper the Trade and Manufactures of the People, and the Labor of the Husbandman, that our Land may yield its Increase: To take Schools and Seminaries of Education, so necessary for cultivating the Principles of true Liberty, Virtue and Piety, under his nurturing Hand; and to prosper the Means of Religion, for the promotion and enlargement of that Kingdom, which consisteth \"in Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost.\nAnd it is further recommended, That servile Labor, and such Recreation, as, though at other Times innocent, may be unbecoming the Purpose of this Appointment, be omitted on so solemn an Occasion.[47]\nGeorge Washington, leader of the revolutionary forces in the American Revolutionary War, proclaimed a Thanksgiving in December 1777 as a victory celebration honoring the defeat of the British at Saratoga.[48]\nThe Continental Congress, the legislative body that governed the United States from 1774 to 1789, issued several \"national days of prayer, humiliation, and thanksgiving\",[49] a practice that was continued by presidents Washington and Adams under the Constitution, and has manifested itself in the established American observances of Thanksgiving and the National Day of Prayer today.[50] This proclamation was published in The Independent Gazetteer, or the Chronicle of Freedom, on November 5, 1782, the first being observed on November 28, 1782:\nBy the United States in Congress assembled,\nPROCLAMATION.\nIt being the indispensable duty of all nations, not only to offer up their supplications to Almighty God, the giver of all good, for His gracious assistance in a time of distress, but also in a solemn and public manner, to give Him praise for His goodness in general, and especially for great and signal interpositions of His Providence in their behalf; therefore, the United States in Congress assembled, taking into their consideration the many instances of Divine goodness to these States in the course of the important conflict, in which they have been so long engaged; the present happy and promising state of public affairs, and the events of the war in the course of the year now drawing to a close; particularly the harmony of the public Councils which is so necessary to the success of the public cause; the perfect union and good understanding which has hitherto subsisted between them and their allies, notwithstanding the artful and unwearied attempts of the common enemy to divide them; the success of the arms of the United States and those of their allies; and the acknowledgment of their Independence by another European power, whose friendship and commerce must be of great and lasting advantage to these States; Do hereby recommend it to the inhabitants of these States in general, to observe and request the several states to interpose their authority, in appointing and commanding the observation of THURSDAY the TWENTY-EIGHTH DAY OF NOVEMBER next as a day of SOLEMN THANKSGIVING to GOD for all His mercies; and they do further recommend to all ranks to testify their gratitude to God for His goodness by a cheerful obedience to His laws and by promoting, each in his station, and by his influence, the practice of true and undefiled religion, which is the great foundation of public prosperity and national happiness.\nDone in Congress at Philadelphia, the eleventh day of October, in the year of our LORD, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two, and of our Sovereignty and Independence, the seventh.\nOn Thursday, September 24, 1789, the first House of Representatives voted to recommend the First Amendment of the newly drafted Constitution to the states for ratification. The next day, Congressman Elias Boudinot from New Jersey proposed that the House and Senate jointly request of President Washington to proclaim a day of thanksgiving for \"the many signal favors of Almighty God\". Boudinot said he \"could not think of letting the session pass over without offering an opportunity to all the citizens of the United States of joining, with one voice, in returning to Almighty God their sincere thanks for the many blessings he had poured down upon them.\"[51]\nAs President, on October 3, 1789, George Washington made the following proclamation and created the first Thanksgiving Day designated by the national government of the United States of America:\nWhereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor, and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me \"to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.\"\nNow therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be. That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks, for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country previous to their becoming a Nation, for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his providence, which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war, for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed, for the peaceable and rational manner, in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted, for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed; and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.\nAnd also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually, to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed, to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shown kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord. To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and Us, and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.\nGiven under my hand at the City of New York the third day of October in the year of our Lord 1789.[52]\nOn January 1, 1795, Washington proclaimed a Thanksgiving Day to be observed on Thursday, February 19.\nThe affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist association, give me the highest satisfaction. My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents, & in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more & more pleasing.\nBelieving with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.\nI reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection & blessing of the common father and creator of man, and tender you for yourselves & your religious association, assurances of my high respect & esteem.\nJames Madison renewed the tradition in 1814, in response to resolutions of Congress, at the close of the War of 1812. Caleb Strong, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, declared the holiday in 1813, \"for a day of public thanksgiving and prayer\" for Thursday, November 25 of that year.[55]\nMadison also declared the holiday twice in 1815; however, neither of these was celebrated in autumn. In 1816, Governor Plumer of New Hampshire appointed Thursday, November 14 to be observed as a day of Public Thanksgiving and Governor Brooks of Massachusetts appointed Thursday, November 28 to be \"observed throughout that State as a day of Thanksgiving\".[56]\nA thanksgiving day was annually appointed by the governor of New York, De Witt Clinton, in 1817. In 1830, the New York State Legislature officially sanctioned thanksgiving as a holiday, making New York the first state outside of New England to do so.[57]\nIn 1846, Sara Josepha Hale began a campaign to make Thanksgiving a national holiday, to be held on the last Thursday in November. She wrote to presidents, members of Congress, and every governor of every state and territory for the next seventeen years to promote the idea, as well as popularizing it in her books and editorials. Hale hoped that Thanksgiving, as a national holiday, would foster the \"moral and social reunion of Americans\".[58] She also proposed that churches mark the holiday by collecting funds for the purchasing of slaves and their education and repatriation back to Africa.[58]\nBy 1860 proclamations appointing a day of thanksgiving were issued by the governors of thirty states and three territories.[58]\nThe year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, the order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax had enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. The population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years, with large increase of freedom.\nNo human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Highest God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.\nIt has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and voice by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to his tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility and Union.\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.\nSince 1863, Thanksgiving has been observed annually in the United States. The holiday superseded Evacuation Day, a de facto national holiday that had been held on November 25 each year prior to the Civil War and commemorated the British withdrawal from the United States after the American Revolution.[60]\n\"Uncle Sam's Thanksgiving Dinner: Come one come all Free and equal\" Thomas Nast cartoon promoting the passage of the 15th amendmentServicemen eating a Thanksgiving dinner after the end of World WarI (1918)\nOn June 28, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Holidays Act that made Thanksgiving a yearly \"appointed or remembered\" federal holiday in Washington D.C. Three other holidays included in the law were New Year, Christmas, and July 4. The law did not extend outside of Washington D.C., while the date assigned for Thanksgiving was left to the discretion of the President.[12][13][14] In January 1879, George Washington's Birthday, February 22, was added by Congress to the federal holidays list.[15] On January 6, 1885, a Congressional act expanded the Holidays Act to apply to all federal departments and employees throughout the nation. Federal workers received pay for all the holidays, including Thanksgiving.[15]\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, Thanksgiving traditions in America varied from region to region. A traditional New England Thanksgiving, for example, consisted of a raffle held on Thanksgiving Eve (in which the prizes were mainly geese or turkeys), a shooting match on Thanksgiving morning (in which turkeys and chickens were used as targets), church services \u2014 and then the traditional feast, which consisted of some familiar Thanksgiving staples such as turkey and pumpkin pie, and some not-so-familiar dishes such as pigeon pie. The earliest high school football rivalries took root in the late 19th century in Massachusetts, stemming from games played on Thanksgiving; professional football took root as a Thanksgiving staple during the sport's genesis in the 1890s, and the tradition of Thanksgiving football both at the high school and professional level continues to this day. The Southern United States had long resisted adopting the holiday before largely accepting it with the increased influence of football on the day.[61]\nIn New York City, people would dress up in fanciful masks and costumes and roam the streets in merry-making mobs. By the beginning of the 20th century, these mobs had morphed[citation needed] into Ragamuffin parades consisting mostly of children dressed as \"ragamuffins\" in costumes of old and mismatched adult clothes and with deliberately smudged faces, but by the late 1950s the tradition had diminished enough to only exist in its original form in a few communities around New York, with many of its traditions subsumed into the Halloween custom of trick-or-treating.[62]\nAbraham Lincoln's successors as president followed his example of annually declaring the final Thursday in November to be Thanksgiving. But in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke with this tradition.[16] November had five Thursdays that year (instead of the more-common four), Roosevelt declared the fourth Thursday as Thanksgiving rather than the fifth one. Although many popular histories state otherwise, he made clear that his plan was to establish the holiday on the next-to-last Thursday in the month instead of the last one. With the country still in the midst of The Great Depression, Roosevelt thought an earlier Thanksgiving would give merchants a longer period to sell goods before Christmas. Increasing profits and spending during this period, Roosevelt hoped, would help bring the country out of the Depression. At the time, advertising goods for Christmas before Thanksgiving was considered inappropriate. Fred Lazarus, Jr., founder of the Federated Department Stores (later Macy's), is credited with convincing Roosevelt to push Thanksgiving to a week earlier to expand the shopping season, and within two years the change passed through Congress into law.[63][64]\nRepublicans decried the change, calling it an affront to the memory of Lincoln. People began referring to November 30 as the \"Republican Thanksgiving\" and November 23 as the \"Democratic Thanksgiving\" or \"Franksgiving\".[65]\nOn October 6, 1941, both houses of the United States Congress passed a joint resolution fixing the traditional last-Thursday date for the holiday beginning in 1942. However, in December of that year the Senate passed an amendment to the resolution that split the difference by requiring that Thanksgiving be observed annually on the fourth Thursday of November, in order to prevent confusion on the occasional years in which November has five Thursdays.[66][13] The amendment also passed the House, and on December 26, 1941, President Roosevelt signed this bill, for the first time making the date of Thanksgiving a matter of federal law and fixing the day as the fourth Thursday of November.[67]\nThe centerpiece of most Thanksgiving celebrations is the Thanksgiving dinner, consisting mainly of foods native to the Americas.[68]\nTurkey, usually roasted and stuffed (but sometimes deep-fried instead), is typically the featured item on most Thanksgiving feast tables. 40 million turkeys were consumed on Thanksgiving Day alone in 2019.[69] With 85 percent of Americans partaking in the meal, an estimated 276 million Americans dine on the festive poultry, spending an expected $1.05 billion on turkeys for Thanksgiving in 2016.[70][71]\nMashed potatoes with gravy, stuffing, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, sweet corn, various fall vegetables, squash, and pumpkin pie are among the side dishes commonly associated with Thanksgiving dinner.[72] All these are actually native to the Americas or were introduced as a new food source to the Europeans when they arrived. Turkey may be an exception.[citation needed]Philbrick (2006)[73] suggests that the Pilgrims might already have been familiar with turkey in England, even though the bird is native to the Americas. The Spaniards had brought domesticated turkeys back from Central America in the early 17th century, and the birds soon became popular fare all over Europe, including England, where turkey (as an alternative to the traditional goose) became a \"fixture at English Christmases\".[73]\nThe Pilgrims did not observe Christmas,[74] as they could find no evidence in the scriptures as to when such a holiday should be celebrated and felt its December scheduling was a spurious Roman Catholic invention.[61]\nAs a result of the size of Thanksgiving dinner, Americans eat more food on Thanksgiving than on any other day of the year.[75]\nThanksgiving dinners tend to be shorter when the participants have political differences.[76]\nThe tradition of giving thanks to God is continued today in many forms, most notably the attendance of religious services, as well as the saying of a mealtime prayer before Thanksgiving dinner. Many houses of worship offer worship services and events on Thanksgiving themes the weekend before, the day of, or the weekend after Thanksgiving.[78] At home, it is a holiday tradition in many families to begin the Thanksgiving dinner by saying grace (a prayer before or after a meal).[79] The custom is portrayed in the photograph \"Family Holding Hands and Praying Before a Thanksgiving Meal\". Before praying, it is a common practice at the dining table for \"each person [to] tell one specific reason they're thankful to God that year\".[80] While grace is said, some families hold hands until the prayer concludes, often indicated with an \"Amen\".[81][82]\nJoy Fisher, a Baptist writer, states that \"this holiday takes on a spiritual emphasis and includes recognition of the source of the blessings they enjoy year round \u2014 a loving God.\"[83] In the same vein, Hesham A. Hassaballa, an American Muslim scholar and physician, has written that Thanksgiving \"is wholly consistent with Islamic principles\" and that \"few things are more Islamic than thanking God for His blessings\".[84] Similarly many Sikh Americans also celebrate the holiday by \"giving thanks to Almighty\".[85]\nHungry diners line up outside a performing arts center for a free Thanksgiving meal in Eugene, Oregon, in 2013.\nThe poor are often provided with food at Thanksgiving time. Most communities have annual food drives that collect non-perishable packaged and canned foods, and corporations sponsor charitable distributions of staple foods and Thanksgiving dinners.[87] The Salvation Army enlists volunteers to serve Thanksgiving dinners to hundreds of people in different locales.[88][89] Additionally, pegged to be five days after Thanksgiving is Giving Tuesday, a celebration of charitable giving.[citation needed]\nSince 1924, in New York City, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is held annually every Thanksgiving Day from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, and televised nationally by NBC. The parade features parade floats with specific themes, performances from Broadway musicals, large balloons of cartoon characters, TV personalities, and high school marching bands. The float that traditionally ends the Macy's Parade is the Santa Claus float, the arrival of which is an unofficial sign of the beginning of the Christmas season. It is billed as the world's largest parade.[90]\nFor many years the Santa Claus Lane Parade (now Hollywood Christmas Parade) in Los Angeles was held on the Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving. In 1978 this was switched to the Sunday following the holiday.[104]\nAmerican football is an important part of many Thanksgiving celebrations in the United States, a tradition that dates to the earliest era of the sport in the late 19th century.[105] Professional football games are often held on Thanksgiving Day; until recently, these were the only games played during the week apart from Sunday or Monday night. The National Football League has played games on Thanksgiving every year since its creation except during World War II. The Detroit Lions have hosted a game every Thanksgiving Day from 1934 to 1938 and again every year since 1945.[106] In 1966, the Dallas Cowboys, which were founded six years earlier, adopted the practice of hosting Thanksgiving games.[107] The league added a third game in primetime in 2006; unlike the traditional afternoon doubleheader, this game has no fixed host.[108]\nSome high school football games (which include some state championship games), and informal \"Turkey Bowl\" contests played by amateur groups and organizations, are frequently held on Thanksgiving weekend.[110] Games of football preceding or following the meal in the backyard or a nearby field are also common during many family gatherings. Amateur games typically follow less organized backyard-rules, two-hand touch or flag football styles.[111]\nA U.S. Army serviceman in a turkey costume leads the Kabul Satellite Turkey Chase 10K Run on Thanksgiving Day 2011.\nThough golf and auto racing are in their off-seasons on Thanksgiving, there are events in those sports that take place on Thanksgiving weekend. The Turkey Night Grand Prix is an annual automobile race that takes place at various venues in southern California on Thanksgiving night;[116] due in part to the fact that this is after the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and IndyCar Series have finished their seasons, it allows some of the top racers in the United States to participate. In golf, Thanksgiving weekend was the traditional time of the Skins Game from 1983 to 2008.[117]\nThe world championship pumpkin chunking contest was held in early November in Delaware and televised each Thanksgiving on Science Channel, but the event was mired in liability disputes following injuries at the events in the 2010s; it has been held only once since 2016,[118] a 2019 contest in Illinois that had far fewer competitors and ran a financial loss.[119]\nIn ice hockey, the National Hockey League announced, as part of its decade-long extension with NBC, that they would begin airing a game on the Friday afternoon following Thanksgiving beginning the 2011\u201312 NHL season; the game has since been branded as the \"Thanksgiving Showdown\". (The Boston Bruins have played matinees on Black Friday since at least 1990, but 2011 was the first time the game was nationally televised.)[120]\nMany American cities hold road running events, known as \"turkey trots\", on Thanksgiving morning, so much so that as of 2018[update], Thanksgiving is the most popular race day in the U.S.[123] Depending on the organizations involved, these can range from one-mile (1.6 km) fun runs to full marathons (although no races currently use the latter; the Atlanta Marathon stopped running on Thanksgiving in 2010).[124]\nIn soccer, Major League Soccer announced in 2021 that a MLS Cup Playoffs match will be held on Thanksgiving for the first time, with a Conference Semifinals match of the 2021 Playoffs between the Colorado Rapids and the Portland Timbers held on that day. While the MLS Cup playoffs were usually held from October to December, no MLS match was held on a Thanksgiving Day before 2021.[125] There will be no MLS Cup Playoff match expected to take place on Thanksgiving in 2022 to avoid conflicts with the 2022 FIFA World Cup which also begins days before Thanksgiving.[126] That MLS Cup match that would air on Fox will be determined by the year Fox has the early NFL game or late NFL game for their \"Football-Futbol Doubleheader\" format.[citation needed]\nWhile not as prolific as Christmas specials, which usually begin right after Thanksgiving, there are many special television programs transmitted on or around Thanksgiving, such as A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, in addition to the live parades and football games mentioned above. In some cases, television broadcasters begin programming Christmas films and specials to run on Thanksgiving Day, taking the day as a signal for the beginning of the Christmas season.[citation needed]\n\"Alice's Restaurant\", an 18-minute monologue by Arlo Guthrie which is partially based on an incident that happened on Thanksgiving in 1965, was first released in 1967. It has since become a tradition on numerous classic rock and classic hits radio stations to play the full, uninterrupted recording to much fanfare each Thanksgiving Day, a tradition that appears to have originated with counterculture radio host Bob Fass, who introduced the song to the public on his radio show.[127] Another song that traditionally gets played on numerous radio stations (of many different formats) is \"The Thanksgiving Song\", a 1992 song by Adam Sandler.[128]\nIn the beginning of the 21st century, Thanksgiving or the day after was the traditional start date when radio stations flipped to continuous Christmas music. Due to Christmas creep, this date has progressed to well before Thanksgiving for most stations that follow this strategy.\nSome legends date the origins of pardoning turkey to the Harry Truman administration or even to Abraham Lincoln pardoning his son's Christmas turkey;[129] both stories have been quoted in more recent presidential speeches, but neither has any evidence in the Presidential record.[130]\nIn more recent years, two turkeys have been pardoned, in case the original turkey becomes unavailable for presidential pardoning.[131][132]\nGeorge H. W. Bush made the turkey pardon a permanent annual tradition upon assuming the presidency in 1989, a tradition that was possibly inspired in part by a joke his predecessor Ronald Reagan had cracked during the 1987 presentation and has been carried on by every president each year since.[133][134] After stints at Frying Pan Farm Park in Herndon, Virginia (1989 to 2004),[135] the Disney Resorts (2005 to 2009),[134]Mount Vernon (the estate of George Washington, 2010 to 2012), and Morven Park (the estate of Westmoreland Davis, 2013 to 2015), turkeys have lived the remainder of their lives in the care of agricultural departments of major universities. The turkeys rarely lived to see the next Thanksgiving due to being bred for large size;[129] this gradually improved over the course of the 2010s as Morven Park and the universities have been more aggressive in maintaining the turkeys' health.[136]\nU.S. President George W. Bush visits Iraq to have Thanksgiving dinner with soldiers in 2003.\nOn Thanksgiving Day, families and friends usually gather for a large meal or dinner.[137] Consequently, the Thanksgiving holiday weekend is one of the busiest travel periods of the year.[138] Thanksgiving is a four-day or five-day weekend vacation for schools and colleges. Most business and government workers (78% as of 2007) are given Thanksgiving and the day after as paid holidays.[139] Thanksgiving Eve (also known as Blackout Wednesday), the night before Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest nights of the year for bars and clubs as many college students and others return to their hometowns to reunite with friends and family.[140]\nMuch like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is observed by some as a \"National Day of Mourning\", in acknowledgment of the genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists.[141][142][143] Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of \"Pilgrims and Natives looking past their differences\" to break bread.[144] Professor R.W. Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: \"One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting.\"[145] Some of the controversy regarding Thanksgiving has been used to justify the Christmas creep (the act of putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving). Those who sympathize with this view acknowledge it as a small minority view; author and humanist J.G. Rodwan, who does not celebrate Thanksgiving, noted\n\"If you put forth the interpretation ... that touches on the dishonorable treatment of the native population that lived in what became the United States, then you are likely to be dismissed as some sort of crank\".[60]\nThanksgiving Day, a function which originated in New England two or three centuries ago when those people recognized that they really had something to be thankful for \u2014 annually, not oftener \u2014 if they had succeeded in exterminating their neighbors, the Indians, during the previous twelve months, instead of getting exterminated by their neighbors, the Indians. Thanksgiving Day became a habit, for the reason that in the course of time, as the years drifted on, it was perceived that the exterminating had ceased to be mutual and was all on the white man's side, consequently on the Lord's side; hence it was proper to thank the Lord for it and extend the usual compliments.\nThe perception of Thanksgiving among Native Americans is not, however, universally negative and some do celebrate the holiday. Tim Giago (Oglala Lakota, 1934\u20132022), founder of the Native American Journalists Association, sought to reconcile Thanksgiving with Native American fall harvest celebrations. He compares Thanksgiving to \"wopila\", a thanks-giving celebration practiced by Native Americans of the Great Plains. He wrote in The Huffington Post: \"The idea of a day of Thanksgiving has been a part of the Native American landscape for centuries. The fact that it is also a national holiday for all Americans blends in perfectly with Native American traditions.\" He also shares personal anecdotes of Native American families coming together to celebrate Thanksgiving.[150]\nMembers of the Oneida Indian Nation marched in the 2010 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with a float called \"The True Spirit of Thanksgiving\" and have done so every year since.[151]\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism (4A) opposed the celebration of Thanksgiving Day, offering an alternative observance called Blamegiving Day, which was in their eyes, \"a protest against Divine negligence, to be observed each year on Thanksgiving Day, on the assumption, for the day only, that God exists\".[152] Citing their view of the separation of church and state, some atheists in recent times have particularly criticized the annual recitation of Thanksgiving proclamations by the President of the United States, because these proclamations often revolve around the theme of giving thanks to God.[153]\nThe move by retailers to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day (as opposed to the traditional day after) has been criticized as forcing (under threat of being fired) low-end retail workers, who compose an increasing share of the nation's workforce, to work odd hours and to handle atypical, unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest.[154] In response to this controversy, Macy's and Best Buy (both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving, even earlier than they had the year before) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees who would rather have the day after Thanksgiving off instead of Thanksgiving itself.[155][156] By 2021, retailers had largely abandoned efforts to hold Thanksgiving doorbusters and returned their focus to Black Friday proper.[157]Blue laws in several Northeastern states[which?] prevent retailers in those states from opening on Thanksgiving. Such retailers typically opened at midnight on the day after Thanksgiving.[156]\nJournalist Edward R. Murrow and producer David Lowe deliberately chose Thanksgiving weekend 1960 to release Murrow's final story for CBS News. Entitled Harvest of Shame, the hour-long documentary was designed \"to shock Americans into action\" regarding the treatment of impoverished migrant workers in the country, hoping to contrast Thanksgiving dinner and its excesses with the poverty of those who picked the vegetables.[158] Murrow acknowledged the documentary portrayed the United States from a hostile perspective and, when he left CBS to join the United States Information Agency in 1961, unsuccessfully tried to stop the special from being aired in the United Kingdom.[159][160]\nSince being fixed on the fourth Thursday in November by law in 1941,[67] the holiday in the United States can occur on any date from November 22 to 28. When it falls on November 22 or 23, it is not the last Thursday, but the penultimate Thursday in November. Regardless, it is the Thursday preceding the last Saturday of November.\nBecause Thanksgiving is a federal holiday, all United States government offices are closed and all employees are paid for that day. It is also a holiday for the New York Stock Exchange and most other financial markets and financial services companies.[161]\nThe date of Thanksgiving Day follows a 28-year cycle, broken only by century years that are not a multiple of 400 (e.g. 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500 ...). The break in the regular cycle is an effect of the leap year algorithm, which dictates that such years are common years as an adjustment for the calendar / season alignment that leap years provide. Past and future dates of celebration include:[162]\nA broader period of Thanksgivingtide leads into and follows the holiday of Thanksgiving itself. The day after Thanksgiving is a holiday for some companies and most schools. In the last two decades of the 20th century, it became known as Black Friday, the beginning of the Christmas shopping season and a day for chaotic, early-morning sales at major retailers that were closed on Thanksgiving.[163] A contrasting movement known as Buy Nothing Day originated in Canada in 1992.[164] The day after Thanksgiving is also Native American Heritage Day, a day to pay tribute to Native Americans for their many contributions to the United States.[165]\nSmall Business Saturday, a movement promoting shopping at smaller local establishments, takes place on the last Saturday in November, two days after Thanksgiving.[166]Cyber Monday is a nickname given to the Monday following Thanksgiving; the day evolved in the early days of the Internet, when consumers returning to work took advantage of their employers' broadband Internet connections to do online shopping and retailers began offering sales to meet the demand.[167] (Green Monday is a similar observance in Christmastide.) Giving Tuesday takes place on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.[168]\n^\nFootball games are scheduled and televised throughout the nation; an elaborately constructed, now traditional Macy's parade may be viewed. There are special services, which some attend, and turkeys and other foods are given by churches and other charitable organizations to the poor.[1]\n^\nHowever, Puritans did participate in occasional days of fasting and days of thanksgiving, sometimes declared by the Church of England but developed even further by the Puritans. ... A day of thanksgiving might be declared to celebrate and thank God for particular military victory, or good health following a wave of disease, or an especially bountiful harvest that saved people from starvation. ... The annual days of thanksgiving consisted mainly of worship services and family dinners, and this was repeated over the years.[3]\n^\n... many of the Indians coming amongst us, and amongst the rest their greatest king Massasoyt, with some ninetie men, whom for three dayes we entertained and feasted ...[6]\n^Winslow, Edward (1624). \"Good Newes from New-England\"(PDF).

        "context": "\nP. J. McGuire, Vice President of the American Federation of Labor, is frequently credited as the father of Labor Day in the United States.\nBeginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, diverse groups of trade unionists chose a variety of days on which to celebrate labor. In the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the early 1880s.\nAlternative accounts of the event's origin exist. Descendants of two men with similar last names claim their great-grandfather was the true father of the holiday.[7]\nAccording to one early history of Labor Day, the event originated in connection with a General Assembly of the Knights of Labor convened in New York City in September 1882.[8] In connection with this clandestine Knights assembly, a public parade of various labor organizations was held on September 5 under the auspices of the Central Labor Union (CLU) of New York.[8] Secretary of the CLU Matthew Maguire is credited for first proposing that a national Labor Day holiday subsequently be held on the first Monday of each September in the aftermath of this successful public demonstration.[2][7]\nAn alternative theory maintains that the idea of Labor Day was the brainchild of Peter J. McGuire, a vice president of the American Federation of Labor, who, after a visit to Toronto where he saw parades celebrating labor that May,[9][10] had put forward the initial proposal in the spring of 1882.[4] According to McGuire, on May 8, 1882, he made a proposition to the fledgling Central Labor Union in New York City that a day be set aside for a \"general holiday for the laboring classes\".[11] According to McGuire he further recommended that the event should begin with a street parade as a public demonstration of organized labor's solidarity and strength, with the march followed by a picnic, to which participating local unions could sell tickets as a fundraiser.[11] According to McGuire he suggested the first Monday in September as an ideal date for such a public celebration, owing to optimum weather and the date's place on the calendar, sitting midway between the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving public holidays.[11]\nLabor Day picnics and other public gatherings frequently featured speeches by prominent labor leaders.[12]\nIn 1909, the American Federation of Labor convention designated the Sunday preceding Labor Day as \"Labor Sunday\", to be dedicated to the spiritual and educational aspects of the labor movement.[2] This secondary date failed to gain significant traction in popular culture, although some churches continue to acknowledge it.[13]\nThe popularity of the event spread across the country. In 1887, Oregon became the first state of the United States to make Labor Day an official public holiday. By 1894, thirty U.S. states were already officially celebrating Labor Day. In that year, Congress passed a bill recognizing the first Monday of September as Labor Day and making it an official federal holiday. President Grover Cleveland signed the bill into law on June 28.[14][4] The federal law, however, only made it a holiday for federal workers. As late as the 1930s, unions were encouraging workers to strike to make sure they got the day off.[15] All U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories have subsequently made Labor Day a statutory holiday.[16] Labor Day became a federal holiday shortly after the Pullman Strike.\nThe date of May 1 (an ancient European folk holiday known as May Day) emerged in 1886 as an alternative holiday for the celebration of labor, later becoming known as International Workers' Day. The date had its origins at the 1885 convention of the American Federation of Labor, which passed a resolution calling for adoption of the eight-hour day effective May 1, 1886.[17] While negotiation was envisioned for achievement of the shortened work day, use of the strike to enforce this demand was recognized, with May 1 advocated as a date for coordinated strike action.[17] The proximity of the date to the bloody Haymarket affair of May 4, 1886, further accentuated May First's radical reputation.[13]\nThere was disagreement among labor unions at this time about when a holiday celebrating workers should be, with some advocating for continued emphasis of the September march-and-picnic date while others sought the designation of the more politically charged date of May 1. Conservative Democratic President Grover Cleveland was one of those concerned that a labor holiday on May 1 would tend to become a commemoration of the Haymarket affair and would strengthen socialist and anarchist movements that backed the May 1 commemoration around the globe.[18] In 1887, he publicly supported the September Labor Day holiday as a less inflammatory alternative,[19] formally adopting the date as a United States federal holiday through a law that he signed in 1894.[2]\nSince the mid-1950s, the United States has celebrated Loyalty Day and Law Day on May 1. Unlike Labor Day, neither are legal public holidays (in that government agencies and most businesses do not shut down to celebrate them) and therefore have remained relatively obscure. Loyalty Day is formally celebrated in a few cities, while some bar associations hold Law Day events to celebrate the rule of law.[20][21]\nLabor Day is called the \"unofficial end of summer\"[22] because it marks the end of the U.S. culture's nominal summer season. Many take their two-week vacations during the two weeks ending Labor Day weekend.[23] Many fall activities, such as school and sports (particularly football), begin about this time.\nIn the United States, many school districts resume classes around the Labor Day holiday weekend (see First day of school). Some begin the week before, making Labor Day weekend the first three-day weekend of the school calendar, while others return the Tuesday following Labor Day. Many districts across the Midwest are opting to begin school after Labor Day.[24]\nIn the U.S. state of Virginia, the amusement park industry has successfully lobbied for legislation requiring most school districts in the state to have their first day of school after Labor Day, in order to give families another weekend to visit amusement parks in the state. The relevant statute has been nicknamed the \"Kings Dominion law\" after one such park.[25] This law was repealed in 2019.[26]\nIn the U.S. state of Minnesota, the State Fair ends on Labor Day. Under state law, public schools normally do not begin until after the holiday. One reason given for this timing was to allow time for schoolchildren to show 4-H projects at the Fair.[27]\nIn fashion, Labor Day is (or was) considered the last day when it is acceptable to wear white[33] or seersucker.[34][35]\nThere are numerous events and activities organized in major cities. For example, New York offers the Labor Day Carnival, and fireworks over Coney Island.[36] In Washington, one popular event is the Labor Day Concert at the U.S. Capitol featuring the National Symphony Orchestra with free attendance.[37]\nTo take advantage of large numbers of potential customers with time to shop, Labor Day has become an important weekend for discounts and allowances by many retailers in the United States, especially for back-to-school sales. Some retailers claim it is one of the largest sale dates of the year, second only to the Christmas season's Black Friday.[38]\n^ abcThe Bridgemen's magazine.

The full listing of teams with consecutive appearances is below in order of first occurrence; winning games are in bold:\n^ abThe Seahawks and Buccaneers each began play in 1976. For scheduling purposes, the Seahawks were placed in the NFC and the Buccaneers were placed in the AFC for their first year of play. In 1977, the two teams switched conferences, placing the Seahawks in the AFC and the Buccaneers in the NFC. In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC. Neither the Seahawks nor Buccaneers have played in the Super Bowl representing the AFC.\nThe New England Patriots played their first championship game in Super Bowl XX (pictured) where they lost to the Bears. This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos).\nFour current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002 (the year Houston joined the NFL). The other two teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl (Cleveland and Detroit) both held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season[n 7]. Teams are listed below according to the length of their current Super Bowl droughts:\n^The New York Jets and Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (Super Bowl III) is the only Super Bowl matchup that cannot be repeated under the current playoff alignment, as the Colts have since been placed in the AFC (at the time, along with all of the former AFL teams, including the Jets) as part of the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970. For the same reason, it is the only Super Bowl rematch that is capable of being played in the postseason outside of the Super Bowl.\n^ abcdThree NFL franchises, the Colts, Steelers, and Browns, were placed in the newly-formed AFC, joining the ten extant AFL franchises, when the two leagues merged in 1970. The Colts are the only team to have qualified for the Super Bowl for both the \"National\" and \"American\" sides.\n^ abcAlthough the 1995 Cleveland Browns became the 1996 Baltimore Ravens, the Browns' name, brand and history remained in Cleveland and was continued by the 1999 Cleveland Browns; the Ravens, for historical purposes, are considered a separate franchise.\n^The Jets and the Chiefs are the only non-NFL teams to win the Super Bowl, both being members of the now-defunct AFL at the time.

        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Animated_Feature#:~:text=2022%0A(95th,del%20Toro%27s%20Pinocchio",
        "context": "\nThe Academy Award for Best Animated Feature is given each year for the best animated film. An animated feature is defined by the academy as a film with a running time of more than 40 minutes in which characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique, a significant number of the major characters are animated, and animation figures in no less than 75 percent of the running time. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in 2002 for films released in 2001.[1][2][3]\nThe entire AMPAS membership has been eligible to choose the winner since the award's inception. If there are sixteen or more films submitted for the category, the winner is voted from a shortlist of five films, otherwise there will only be three films on the shortlist.[4]\nBy 2001, the rise of sustained competitors to Disney in the feature animated film market, such as DreamWorks Animation (founded by former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg), created an increase of film releases of significant annual number enough for AMPAS to reconsider.[11] The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first given out at the 74th Academy Awards,[12] held on March 24, 2002.[13] The academy included a rule that stated that the award would not be presented in a year in which fewer than eight eligible films opened in theaters.[14] It dropped the rule on April 23, 2019, to make voting for animated films more acceptable.[15] People in the animation industry, as well as fans, expressed hope that the prestige from this award and the resulting boost to the box office would encourage the increased production of animated features.\nIn 2009, when the nominee slots for Best Picture were doubled to ten, Up was nominated for both Animated Feature and Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards, the first to do so since the inception of the Animated Feature category. This feat was repeated the following year by Toy Story 3.\nSome members and fans have criticized the award, however, saying it is only intended to prevent animated films from having a chance of winning Best Picture. DreamWorks had advertised heavily during the holiday 2001 season for Shrek, but was disappointed when the rumored Best Picture nomination did not materialize, though it was nominated for and ultimately won the inaugural Best Animated Feature award.[1]\nThe criticism surrounding the Best Animated Feature category was particularly prominent at the 81st Academy Awards, in which WALL-E won the award but was not nominated for Best Picture, despite receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike and being generally considered to be one of the best films of 2008.[19][20][21][22] This sparked controversy over whether the film was deliberately snubbed of such nomination by the academy. Film critic Peter Travers commented that \"if there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, it's WALL-E.\" However, official Academy Award regulations state that any film nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture.[4]\nFrom 2010 onward, with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category, Pixar (a perennial nominee) did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box-office receipts, while Pixar's sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards.[23]\nAt the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, Bailey stated that animated films are \"formative experiences as kids who watch them,\" as James put it, \"So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again.\" Scott added: \"I see some parents who know exactly what we're talking about.\"[24] The remarks were heavily criticized by animation fans and those working in the animation industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are strictly for children, especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of Hollywood content and revenue during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phil Lord, co-producer of one of the nominated films, The Mitchells vs. the Machines, tweeted that it was \"super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure.\" The film's official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading: \"Animation is cinema.\"[25][26] A week later, Lord and his producing partner Christopher Miller wrote a guest column in Variety criticizing the academy for the joke and how Hollywood has been treating animation writing that \"no one set out to diminish animated films, but it's high time we set out to elevate them.\" They also suggested to the academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema.[27]\nAdding to the controversy was that the award for Best Animated Short Film (the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children) was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast.[28] The winner for the Best Animated Short award was The Windshield Wiper, a multilingual Spanish-American film which is adult animated, while another nominee in three categories: Best Animated Feature, Best Documentary Feature, and Best International Feature Film, was Flee, a PG-13 rated animated documentary about an Afghan refugee. Alberto Mielgo, director of The Windshield Wiper, later gave an acceptance speech for the Oscar: \"Animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine. Animation for adults is a fact. It's happening. Let's call it cinema. I'm very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation.\"[29] Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision to not broadcast the award.[30]\nUp and Toy Story 3 are the first two films to have won both Best Animated Feature and to have received Best Picture nominations. Their nominations after the academy expanded the potential number of nominees for Best Picture from five to ten.\nShrek is the only non-Disney/Pixar animated film to be nominated for a screenwriting category, Best Adapted Screenplay, while winning the inaugural Best Animated Feature category.[56][57]\n\u2021Dates and years listed for each ceremony were the eligibility period of film release in Los Angeles County. For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period was done on a seasonal basis, from August to July. For the 6th ceremony, held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933. From the 7th ceremony, held in 1935, through the 92nd ceremony, held in 2020, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. For the 93rd ceremony, held in 2021, the eligibility period was from January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. For the 94th ceremony, held in 2022, the eligibility period was from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021.",

        "context": "\nThe version history of the Androidmobile operating system began with the public release of its first beta on November 5, 2007. The first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released on September 23, 2008. The operating system is developed by Google on a yearly cycle since at least 2011.[1] New major releases are announced at Google I/O along with its first public beta to supported Google Pixel devices. The stable version is then released later in the year.\nThe development of Android started in 2003 by Android, Inc., which was purchased by Google in 2005.[2] There were at least two internal releases of the software inside Google and the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) before the beta version was released.[3][4] The beta was released on November 5, 2007,[5][6] while the software development kit (SDK) was released on November 12, 2007.[7] Several public beta versions of the SDK were released.[8] These releases were done through software emulation as physical devices did not exist to test the operating system. Both the operating system itself and the SDK were released along with their source code, as free software under the Apache License.[9]\nThe first public release of Android 1.0 occurred with the release of the T-Mobile G1 (aka HTC Dream) in October 2008.[10] Android 1.0 and 1.1 were not released under specific code names.[11] The code names \"Astro Boy\" and \"Bender\" were tagged internally on some of the early pre-1.0 milestone builds and were never used as the actual code names of the 1.0 and 1.1 releases of the OS.[12]\nThe project manager, Ryan Gibson, conceived using a confectionery-themed naming scheme for public releases, starting with Android 1.5 Cupcake. Google announced in August 2019 they were ending the confectionery theming scheme to use numerical ordering for future versions.[13] The first release under the numerical order format was Android 10, which was released September 2019.\nIn 2017, Google announced that Google Play would begin to require apps to target a recent Android version.[14] Since then, a new major Android version has been released in the second half of each year, and apps must target it by August 31 of the following year for new apps, or November 1 for app updates.[15]\n^12L launched as part of the March 2022 security update to supported Pixel devices. The factory images for March 2022 and subsequent updates display the version as 12.1.[25] The device's about page will still show the Android version as 12.[26]\nThe following tables show the release dates and key features of all Android operating system updates to date, listed chronologically by their official application programming interface (API) levels.\nAndroid 1.0 (API 1)\nAndroid 1.0, the first commercial version of the software, was released on September 23, 2008.[29] The first commercially available Android device was the HTC Dream.[30] Android 1.0 incorporated the following features:\nOn February 9, 2009, the Android 1.1 update was released, initially for the HTC Dream only. Android 1.1 was known as \"Petit Four\" internally, though this name was not used officially.[12][37] The update resolved bugs, changed the Android API and added a number of features:[38]\nVersion\nRelease date\nFeatures\n1.1\nFebruary 9, 2009\nDetails and reviews available when a user searches for businesses on Maps.\nLonger in-call screen timeout by default when using the speakerphone, plus the ability to show/hide the dialpad.\nOn April 27, 2009, the Android 1.5 update was released, based on Linux kernel 2.6.27.[39][40] This was the first release to officially use a codename based on a dessert item (\"Cupcake\"), a theme used for all releases until Android Pie, with Android 10 and later using a number-only system. The update included several new features and UI amendments:[41]\nOpen Accessory Library support. Open Accessory was introduced in 3.1 (Honeycomb) but the Open Accessory Library grants 2.3.4 added support when connecting to a USB peripheral with compatible software and a compatible application on the device.[77]\nSwitched the default encryption for SSL from AES256-SHA to RC4-MD5.[78][79]\nOn February 22, 2011, the Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) SDK \u2013 the first tablet-only Android update \u2013 was released, based on Linux kernel 2.6.36.[85][86][87][88] The first device featuring this version, the Motorola Xoom tablet, was released on February 24, 2011.[89] The update's features included:[85]\nDisallows applications from having to write access to secondary storage (memory cards on devices with internal primary storage) outside of designated, application-specific directories. Full access to primary internal storage is still allowed through a separate application-level permission.[91][92]\nThe SDK for Android 4.0.1 (Ice Cream Sandwich), based on Linux kernel 3.0.1,[98] was publicly released on October 19, 2011.[99] Google's Gabe Cohen stated that Android 4.0 was \"theoretically compatible\" with any Android 2.3.x device in production at that time.[100] The source code for Android 4.0 became available on November 14, 2011.[101] Ice Cream Sandwich was the last version to officially support Adobe Systems' Flash player.[102] The update introduced numerous new features:[103][104][105]\nGoogle announced Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) at the Google I/O conference on June 27, 2012. Based on Linux kernel 3.0.31, Jelly Bean was an incremental update with the primary aim of improving the functionality and performance of the user interface. The performance improvement involved \"Project Butter\", which uses touch anticipation, triple buffering, extended vsync timing and a fixed frame rate of 60 fps to create a fluid and \"buttery-smooth\" UI.[114] Android 4.1 Jelly Bean was released to the Android Open Source Project on July 9, 2012,[115] and the Nexus 7 tablet, the first device to run Jelly Bean, was released on July 13, 2012.\nVersion\nRelease date\nFeatures\nImage(s)\n4.1\nJuly 9, 2012\nSmoother user interface:\nVsync timing across all drawing and animation done by the Android framework, including application rendering, touch events, screen composition and display refresh.\nGoogle was expected to announce Jelly Bean 4.2 at an event in New York City on October 29, 2012, but the event was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy.[123] Instead of rescheduling the live event, Google announced the new version with a press release, under the slogan \"A new flavor of Jelly Bean\". Jelly Bean 4.2 was based on Linux kernel 3.4.0, and debuted on Google's Nexus 4 and Nexus 10, which were released on November 13, 2012.[124][125]\nAccessibility improvements: triple-tap to magnify the entire screen, pan and zoom with two fingers. Speech output and Gesture Mode navigation for blind users.\nNew clock application with a built-in world clock, stop watch and timer.\nAll devices now use the same interface layout, previously adapted from phones on 4.1 for smaller tablets (with centered software buttons, the system bar at the top of the screen, and a home screen with a dock and centered application menu), regardless of screen size.\nIncreased number of extended notifications and Actionable Notifications for more applications, allowing users to respond to certain notifications within the notification bar and without launching the application directly.\nGoogle released Jelly Bean 4.3 under the slogan \"An even sweeter Jelly Bean\" on July 24, 2013, during an event in San Francisco called \"Breakfast with Sundar Pichai\". Most Nexus devices received the update within a week, although the second-generation Nexus 7 tablet was the first device to officially ship with it.[136] A minor bug fix update was released on August 22, 2013.[137]\nGoogle announced Android 4.4 KitKat on September 3, 2013. Although initially under the \"Key Lime Pie\" (\"KLP\") codename, the name was changed because \"very few people actually know the taste of a key lime pie.\"[149] Some technology bloggers also expected the \"Key Lime Pie\" release to be Android 5.[150] KitKat debuted on Google's Nexus 5 on October 31, 2013, and was optimized to run on a greater range of devices than earlier Android versions, having 512 MB of RAM as a recommended minimum; those improvements were known as \"Project Svelte\" internally at Google.[151] The required minimum amount of RAM available to Android is 340 MB, and all devices with less than 512 MB of RAM must report themselves as \"low RAM\" devices.[152]\nStorage Access Framework, an API allowing apps to retrieve files in a consistent manner. As part of the framework, a new system file picker allows users to access files from various sources (including those exposed by apps, such as online storage services).[91]\nAndroid 5.0 \"Lollipop\" was unveiled under the codename \"Android L\" on June 25, 2014, during Google I/O. It became available as an official over-the-air (OTA) update on November 12, 2014, for select devices that run distributions of Android serviced by Google, including Nexus and Google Play edition devices. Its source code was made available on November 3, 2014.[182][183]\nLollipop features a redesigned user interface built around a responsive design language referred to as \"material design\". Other changes include improvements to the notifications, which can be accessed from the lockscreen and displayed within applications as top-of-the-screen banners. Furthermore, Google made internal changes to the platform, with the Android Runtime (ART) officially replacing Dalvik for improved application performance, and with changes intended to improve and optimize battery usage, known internally as Project Volta.[184][185][186][187]\nGuest logins and multiple user accounts are available on more devices, such as phones.[192]\nAudio input and output through USB devices.\nThird-party applications regain the ability to read and modify data located anywhere on external storage, such as on SD cards. However, those must be adapted to the storage access framework of Android API level 21 or higher.[193][194]\nFixes a bug with TRIM support (introduced in Version 4.3), which prevented devices from running on-charger cleanups of file system allocations if the device was turned off at midnight, or if it was charged only when in use.[203]\nChanges how alarms wake the CPU, and how alarms compete for system resources.[204]\nAndroid 6.0 \"Marshmallow\" was unveiled under the codename \"Android M\" during Google I/O on May 28, 2015, for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 phones, Nexus 9 tablet, and Nexus Player set-top box, under the build number MPZ44Q.[210] The third developer preview (MPA44G) was released on August 17, 2015, for the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player devices,[211] and was updated to MPA44I that brought fixes related to Android for Work profiles.[212]\nAndroid \"Nougat\" (codenamed N in-development) is the seventh major release of the Android operating system. It was first released as a developer preview on March 9, 2016, with factory images for supported Nexus devices, as well as with the new \"Android Beta Program\" which allows supported devices to be upgraded directly to the Android Nougat beta via an over-the-air update. The final release was on August 22, 2016. The final preview build was released on July 18, 2016,[233] with the build number NPD90G.\nOn October 19, 2016, Google released Android 7.1.1 as a developer preview for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and the Pixel C. A second preview became available on November 22, 2016, before the final version was released to the public on December 5, 2016.\nAndroid Oreo is the eighth major release of the Android operating system. It was first released as a developer preview, codenamed Android O, on March 21, 2017, with factory images for supported Nexus and Pixel devices. The final developer preview was released on July 24, 2017, with the stable version released in August 2017.\nAndroid 8.1 Oreo is the sixteenth minor release of the Android operating system. It was first released as a developer preview on October 25, 2017, with factory images for current Nexus and Pixel devices. A second developer preview was made available on November 27, 2017, for Nexus and Pixel devices, before the stable version was released on December 5, 2017.\nAndroid Pie is the ninth major version of the Android operating system. It was first announced by Google on March 7, 2018, and the first developer preview was released on the same day. The second preview, considered beta quality, was released on May 8, 2018. The final beta of Android Pie (fifth preview, also considered as a \"Release Candidate\") was released on July 25, 2018. The first official release was released on August 6, 2018.\nAndroid 12L[c] is an interim release for Android 12 that includes design tweaks for larger displays and minor stability changes to the operating system. It was announced on October 2021 alongside Beta releases with a stable version launching on March 7, 2022.\nVersion\nRelease date\nFeatures\nImage(s)\n12L\nMarch 7, 2022\nImprovements specific for foldable phones, tablets, desktop-sized screens and Chromebooks, and modifications to the user interface to tailor it to larger screens.[297]\nART update with a new garbage collector (GC) utilizing the Linux userfaultfd system call.[303][304][305] It reduces memory pressure, compiled code size, jank and prevents the risk of killing apps because of low memory during GC.[305] Other changes also improve app startup, reduce jank and improve performance.[305] Because of the Mainline project, Android 12 ART will also be updated.[303]\nThe main hardware platform for Android is the 64-bitARM architecture (i.e. ARMv8-A; previously the 32-bitARMv7 architecture was supported and first ARMv5), with x86[d] and MIPS[e] architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android, but MIPS support has since been deprecated and support was removed in NDK r17.[311]\nAndroid1.0 through 1.5 required a 2 megapixel camera with autofocus camera. This was relaxed to a fixed-focus camera with Android1.6.[312]\nIn 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones[313] and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64.[314][315] Since Android5.0 Lollipop, 64-bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the 32-bit variants.\nRequirements for the minimum amount of RAM for devices running Android 7.1 depend on screen size and density and type of CPU, ranging from 816MB\u20131.8GB for 64-bit and 512MB\u20131.3GB for 32-bit meaning in practice 1GB for the most common type of display (while minimum for Android watch is 416MB).[316][f] The recommendation for Android4.4 is to have at least 512MB of RAM,[317] while for \"low RAM\" devices 340MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor.[152] Android 4.4 requires a 32-bitARMv7, MIPS or x86 architecture processor,[318] together with an OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible graphics processing unit (GPU).[319] Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.2 and since Android 7.0 Vulkan (and version 1.1 available for some devices[320]). Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.[319] In 2021, Android was ported to RISC-V.[321] In 2021, Qualcomm said it will support more updates.[322]\n^The 2.3.6 update had the side-effect of impairing the Wi-Fi hotspot functionality of many Canadian Nexus S phones. Google acknowledged this problem and fixed it in late September.[83][84]\n^For Canadian consumers, 4.0.2 reportedly created a bug on the Galaxy Nexus that crashed the application market when users attempted to view details of any Android application. It also inadvertently reduced the NFC capabilities of the Nexus phone.[109][110]\n^Mithun Chandrasekhar (February 2, 2011). \"Google's Android Event Analysis\". AnandTech. Retrieved February 5, 2011.

Based on a series of Osage Indian murders that occurred over 20 years in the early 20th century after oil was discovered on the natives' land in Oklahoma, the film has already earned US$137million and received Oscar buzz for those involved in the film.\nOnly with its season/series finale the return of Tom Hiddleston as the Asgardian God of Mischief warranted an entry here. It's easy to see why, as Secret Invasion already frustrated those following the Disney+ Marvel Cinematic Universe shows, and the previous five episodes of Loki mostly focused on complicated time mechanics that would make Doctor Who jealous.

        "question": "Which movie won the latest Academy Award for Best Picture?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture#2020s:~:text=2022%0A(95th),All%20at%20Once",
        "context": "\nThe Academy Award for Best Picture is one of the Academy Awards (also known as Oscars) presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) since the awards debuted in 1929. This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot.[1] The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.[2][3][4]\nThe Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception.[5] There have been 591 films nominated for Best Picture and 95 winners.[6]\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture,\" the former being won by the war epic Wings, and the latter by the art film Sunrise. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, The Jazz Singer was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a sui generis item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.[7]\nThe following year, the Academy dropped the Unique and Artistic Picture award, deciding retroactively that the award won by Wings was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award.[8] Although the award kept the title Outstanding Picture for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called Best Picture.[6]\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of Shakespeare in Love had received the award.[9][10][11]\nAs of 2020[update], the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:[12]\nThose with screen credit of \"producer\" or \"produced by\", explicitly excluding those with the screen credit \"executive producer, co-producer, associate producer, line producer, or produced in association with\"\nthose three or fewer producers who have performed the major portion of the producing functions\nThe rules allow a bona fide team of not more than two people to be considered a single \"producer\" if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.[12]\nThe Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for The Reader.[13] As of 2014[update] the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in \"rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].\"[12]\nSteven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at twelve, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. As for the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer holds the record with five wins and 40 nominations.\nOn June 24, 2009, AMPAS announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from five to ten, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009).[15] Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of The Dark Knight and WALL-E (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture.[16][17][18] Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when eight to 12 films were nominated each year. \"Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,\" AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. \"I can't wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.\"[15]\nAt the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting).[19] In 2011, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between five and ten; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process.[20] Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, \"A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system. Oliver! is the only G-rated film and Midnight Cowboy is the only X-rated (now NC-17) film, so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been downgraded to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was Patton (1970) and the most recent was Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was The Last Emperor (1987) and the most recent was CODA (2021).\nOnly three animated films have been nominated for Best Picture: Beauty and the Beast (1991), Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010). The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won.\nThe Best Documentary Feature category was initiated in 1941, leaving Chang as the only documentary feature previously nominated, and that in the \"Unique and Artistic Production\" category at the 1927/28 awards.\nToy Story 3, Mad Max: Fury Road and Top Gun: Maverick are the only sequels to be nominated without any predecessors being nominated. The Godfather Part II and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King are the only sequels to have won the award, and their respective trilogies are the only series to have three films nominated. The Godfather series is the only film series with multiple Best Picture winners, with the first film winning the award for 1972 and the second film winning the award for 1974.[23]\nClint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima was a companion piece to his film Flags of Our Fathers that was released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back.\nThe Artist (2011) was the first essentially silent (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and a dream sequence with sound effects) film since Wings to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928's The Patriot. It was the first Best Picture winner to be produced entirely in black-and-white since 1960's The Apartment. (Schindler's List, the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but contains some color sequences.)[26]\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\" which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023.[38] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development.[38] As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\".[39] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities, or who are deaf or hard of hearing.[38]\nFor the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were required to submit a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form to be considered for Best Picture but were not required to fulfill the standards.[39] These standards will only apply to the Best Picture category and do not affect a film's eligibility in other Oscar categories.[38]\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees.[6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, however, it may be the year after first release (as with Casablanca and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, Crash). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\nUntil 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of Shakespeare in Love made speeches after its win.[9][10] A three-producer limit has been applied some years since.[10][11] There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of Crash and Little Miss Sunshine.[11] The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for The Reader.[13] However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.\nFor the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten; it was adjusted from 2011 to 2020 to vary between five and ten, but has been a full ten since 2021.\nFor the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. This has been the rule every year since except 2020, when the end date was extended to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021, which was correspondingly limited to March 1 to December 31.\n^The 2nd Academy Awards is unique in being the only occasion where there were no official nominees. Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of de facto nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges at the time.\n^The Academy also announced that A Farewell to Arms came in second, and Little Women third.\n^The Academy also announced that The Barretts of Wimpole Street came in second, and The House of Rothschild third.\n^The Academy also announced that The Informer came in second, and Captain Blood third.\n\u2021Dates and years listed for each ceremony were the eligibility period of film release in Los Angeles County. For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period was done on a seasonal basis, from August to July. For the 6th ceremony, held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933. From the 7th ceremony, held in 1935, through the 92nd ceremony, held in 2020, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. For the 93rd ceremony, held in 2021, the eligibility period was from January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. For the 94th ceremony, held in 2022, the eligibility period was from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021.",

        "context": "\nPatch Tuesday[1] (also known as Update Tuesday[1][2]) is an unofficial term used to refer to when Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle and others regularly release software patches for their software products.[3] It is widely referred to in this way by the industry.[4][5][6] Microsoft formalized Patch Tuesday in October 2003.[1][7] Patch Tuesday is known within Microsoft also as the \"B\" release, to distinguish it from the \"C\" and \"D\" releases that occur in the third and fourth weeks of the month, respectively.[1]\nPatch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month[8] in North America. Critical security updates are occasionally released outside of the normal Patch Tuesday cycle; these are known as \"Out-of-band\" releases. As far as the integrated Windows Update (WU) function is concerned, Patch Tuesday begins at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.[9] Vulnerability information is immediately available in the Security Update Guide. The updates show up in Download Center before they are added to WU, and the KB articles are unlocked later.\nLess experienced users often remained unaware of Windows Update and did not install it. Microsoft countered this issue in Windows ME with the Automatic Updates component, which displayed availability of updates, with the option of automatic installation.\nCustomers with multiple copies of Windows, such as corporate users, not only had to update every Windows deployment in the company but also to uninstall patches issued by Microsoft that broke existing functionality.\nMicrosoft introduced \"Patch Tuesday\" in October 2003 to reduce the cost of distributing patches after the Blaster worm.[10] This system accumulates security patches over a month, and dispatches them all on the second Tuesday of each month, an event for which system administrators may prepare. The following day, informally known as \"Exploit Wednesday\",[11] marks the time when exploits may appear in the wild which take advantage on unpatched machines of the newly announced vulnerabilities.\nTuesday was chosen as the optimal day of the week to distribute software patches. This is done to maximize the amount of time available before the upcoming weekend to correct any issues that might arise with those patches, while leaving Monday free to address other unexpected issues that might have arisen over the preceding weekend[citation needed].\nAn obvious security implication is that security problems that have a solution are withheld from the public for up to a month. This policy is adequate when the vulnerability is not widely known or is extremely obscure, but that is not always the case.\nThere have been cases where vulnerability information became public or actual worms were circulating prior to the next scheduled Patch Tuesday. In critical cases Microsoft issues corresponding patches as they become ready, alleviating the risk if updates are checked for and installed frequently.\nAt the Ignite 2015 event, Microsoft revealed a change in distributing security patches. They release security updates to home PCs, tablets and phones as soon as they are ready, while enterprise customers will stay on the monthly update cycle, which was reworked as Windows Update for Business.[12]\nMany exploitation events are seen shortly after the release of a patch;[13]analysis of the patch helps exploit developers to immediately take advantage of the previously undisclosed vulnerability, which will remain in unpatched systems.[14] Therefore, the term \"Exploit Wednesday\" was coined.[15]\nMicrosoft warned users that it discontinued support for Windows XP starting on April 8, 2014 \u2013 users running Windows XP afterwards would be at the risk of attacks. As security patches of newer Windows versions can reveal similar (or same) vulnerabilities already present in older Windows versions, this can allow attacks on devices with unsupported Windows versions (cf. \"zero-day attacks\"). However Microsoft stopped fixing such (and other) vulnerabilities in unsupported Windows versions, regardless how widely known they became, leaving devices running these Windows versions vulnerable to attacks. Microsoft made a singular exception during the rapid spread of the WannaCry ransomware and released patches in May 2017 for the by then-unsupported Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 (in addition to then supported Windows versions).[16]\nFor Windows Vista \"extended support\" was ended April 11, 2017, which will leave vulnerabilities discovered afterwards unfixed, creating the same situation for Vista as for XP before.[17]\nFor Windows 7 (including Service Pack 1), support ended January 14, 2020,[17] and on January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1;[17] this will cause the same \"unfixed vulnerabilities\" issue for users of these operating systems. Support for Windows 8 already ended January 12, 2016 (with users having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to continue to get support), and support for Windows 7 without SP1 was ended April 9, 2013 (with the ability to install SP1 to continue to get support until 2020, or having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to receive support after 2020).[17]\nStarting with Windows 10, Microsoft began releasing feature updates of Windows twice per year. These releases brought new functionalities, and are governed by Microsoft's modern lifecycle policy, which specifies a support period of 18-36 months. This is in contrast to previous Windows versions, which received only infrequent updates via service packs, and whose support was governed by the fixed lifecycle policy. With the release of Windows 11, both Windows 10 and 11 started receiving annual feature updates in the second half of the year.\nOnce a release's support period ends, devices must be updated to the latest feature update in order to receive updates from Microsoft. As such, for Home and Pro editions of Windows 10 and 11, the latest Windows version is downloaded and installed automatically when the device approaches the end of support date.\n^Four updates were released: \"Moment 1\" with build 22621.675 on October 18, 2022 \"Moment 2\" with build 22621.1344 on February 28, 2023 \"Moment 3\" with build 22621.1778 on May 24, 2023 \"Moment 4\" with build 22621.2361 on September 26, 2023\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color have reached their expiration dates and are no longer supported by Microsoft.\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color are no longer the latest version of Windows 11, but are still supported by Microsoft.\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color are the latest (by SKU) public version of Windows 11.\nIn addition to the commonly used editions like Home and Pro, Microsoft offers specialized Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) versions of Windows 10 with longer support timelines, governed by Microsoft's fixed lifecycle policy. For instance, Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB will receive extended support until October 13, 2026,[18] and Windows 10 LTSC 2019 will receive extended support until January 9, 2029.[19]\nSAP's \"Security Patch Day\", when the company advises users to install security updates, was chosen to coincide with Patch Tuesdays.[20]Adobe Systems' update schedule for Flash Player since November 2012 also coincides with Patch Tuesday.[21] One of the reasons for this is that Flash Player comes as part of Windows starting with Windows 8 and Flash Player updates for the built-in and the plugin based version both need to be published at the same time in order to prevent reverse-engineering threats. Oracle's quarterly updates coincide with Patch Tuesday.[22]\nWindows Update uses the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download the updates, using idle network bandwidth.[23] However BITS will use the speed as reported by the network interface (NIC) to calculate bandwidth. This can lead to bandwidth calculation errors, for example when a fast network adapter (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (e.g. 56 kbit/s) \u2013 according to Microsoft \"BITS will compete for the full bandwidth [of the NIC] ... BITS has no visibility of the network traffic beyond the client.\"[24]\nFurthermore, the Windows Update servers of Microsoft do not honor the TCP's slow start congestion control strategy.[25] As a result, other users on the same network may experience significantly slower connections from machines actively retrieving updates. This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth-constrained link such as those found in many multi-PC homes and small to medium-sized businesses. Bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers can be reduced significantly by deploying Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to distribute the updates locally.\nIn addition to updates being downloaded from Microsoft servers, Windows 10 devices can \"share\" updates in a peer-to-peer fashion with other Windows 10 devices on the local network, or even with Windows 10 devices on the internet. This can potentially distribute updates faster while reducing usage for networks with a metered connection.[26][27]",

However Microsoft stopped fixing such (and other) vulnerabilities in unsupported Windows versions, regardless how widely known they became, leaving devices running these Windows versions vulnerable to attacks. Microsoft made a singular exception during the rapid spread of the WannaCry ransomware and released patches in May 2017 for the by then-unsupported Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 (in addition to then supported Windows versions).[16]\nFor Windows Vista \"extended support\" was ended April 11, 2017, which will leave vulnerabilities discovered afterwards unfixed, creating the same situation for Vista as for XP before.[17]\nFor Windows 7 (including Service Pack 1), support ended January 14, 2020,[17] and on January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1;[17] this will cause the same \"unfixed vulnerabilities\" issue for users of these operating systems. Support for Windows 8 already ended January 12, 2016 (with users having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to continue to get support), and support for Windows 7 without SP1 was ended April 9, 2013 (with the ability to install SP1 to continue to get support until 2020, or having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to receive support after 2020).[17]\nStarting with Windows 10, Microsoft began releasing feature updates of Windows twice per year. These releases brought new functionalities, and are governed by Microsoft's modern lifecycle policy, which specifies a support period of 18-36 months. This is in contrast to previous Windows versions, which received only infrequent updates via service packs, and whose support was governed by the fixed lifecycle policy. With the release of Windows 11, both Windows 10 and 11 started receiving annual feature updates in the second half of the year.\nOnce a release's support period ends, devices must be updated to the latest feature update in order to receive updates from Microsoft. As such, for Home and Pro editions of Windows 10 and 11, the latest Windows version is downloaded and installed automatically when the device approaches the end of support date.\n^Four updates were released: \"Moment 1\" with build 22621.675 on October 18, 2022 \"Moment 2\" with build 22621.1344 on February 28, 2023 \"Moment 3\" with build 22621.1778 on May 24, 2023 \"Moment 4\" with build 22621.2361 on September 26, 2023\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color have reached their expiration dates and are no longer supported by Microsoft.\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color are no longer the latest version of Windows 11, but are still supported by Microsoft.\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color are the latest (by SKU) public version of Windows 11.\nIn addition to the commonly used editions like Home and Pro, Microsoft offers specialized Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) versions of Windows 10 with longer support timelines, governed by Microsoft's fixed lifecycle policy. For instance, Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB will receive extended support until October 13, 2026,[18] and Windows 10 LTSC 2019 will receive extended support until January 9, 2029.[19]\nSAP's \"Security Patch Day\", when the company advises users to install security updates, was chosen to coincide with Patch Tuesdays.[20]Adobe Systems' update schedule for Flash Player since November 2012 also coincides with Patch Tuesday.[21] One of the reasons for this is that Flash Player comes as part of Windows starting with Windows 8 and Flash Player updates for the built-in and the plugin based version both need to be published at the same time in order to prevent reverse-engineering threats. Oracle's quarterly updates coincide with Patch Tuesday.[22]\nWindows Update uses the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download the updates, using idle network bandwidth.[23] However BITS will use the speed as reported by the network interface (NIC) to calculate bandwidth. This can lead to bandwidth calculation errors, for example when a fast network adapter (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (e.g. 56 kbit/s) \u2013 according to Microsoft \"BITS will compete for the full bandwidth [of the NIC] ... BITS has no visibility of the network traffic beyond the client.\"[24]\nFurthermore, the Windows Update servers of Microsoft do not honor the TCP's slow start congestion control strategy.[25] As a result, other users on the same network may experience significantly slower connections from machines actively retrieving updates. This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth-constrained link such as those found in many multi-PC homes and small to medium-sized businesses. Bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers can be reduced significantly by deploying Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to distribute the updates locally.\nIn addition to updates being downloaded from Microsoft servers, Windows 10 devices can \"share\" updates in a peer-to-peer fashion with other Windows 10 devices on the local network, or even with Windows 10 devices on the internet. This can potentially distribute updates faster while reducing usage for networks with a metered connection.[26][27]",

        "question": "What is the host stadium of this year's Super Bowl?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl#:~:text=State%20Farm%20Stadium%2C,%2C%202015%2C%202023",
        "context": "\nThe Super Bowl is the annual league championship game of the National Football League (NFL). It has served as the final game of every NFL season since 1966, replacing the NFL Championship Game. Since 2022, the game is played on the second Sunday in February. Prior Super Bowls were played on Sundays in early to mid-January from 1967 to 1978, late January from 1979 to 2003,[a] and the first Sunday of February from 2004 to 2021. Winning teams are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the eponymous coach who won the first two Super Bowls. Due to the NFL restricting use of its \"Super Bowl\" trademark, it is frequently referred to as the \"big game\" or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. The day the game is played is often referred to as \"Super Bowl Sunday\" or simply \"Super Sunday\".\nThe game was created as part of a 1966 merger agreement between the NFL and the competing American Football League (AFL) to have their best teams compete for a championship. It was originally called the AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game until the \"Super Bowl\" moniker was adopted in 1969's Super Bowl III. The first four Super Bowls from 1967 to 1970 were played before the merger, with the NFL and AFL each winning two. After the merger in 1970, the 10 AFL teams and three NFL teams formed the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the National Football Conference (NFC). All games since 1971's Super Bowl V have been played between the two best teams from each conference. Since the inception of the Super Bowl, the NFC leads the AFC in wins 29\u201328.\nThe Super Bowl is among the world's most-watched single sporting events and frequently commands the largest audience among all American broadcasts during the year. It is second only to the UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual club sporting event worldwide,[2] and the seven most-watched broadcasts in American television history are Super Bowls.[3]Commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year because of the high viewership, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for the broadcast and commercial viewership becoming an integral part of the event. The Super Bowl is also the second-largest event for American food consumption, behind Thanksgiving dinner.[4]\nFor four decades after its 1920 inception, the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. In 1960, the NFL encountered its most serious competitor when the American Football League (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. The original \"bowl game\" was the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, which was first played in 1902 as the \"Tournament East\u2013West football game\" as part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and moved to the new Rose Bowl Stadium in 1923. The stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. The Tournament of Roses football game eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar Bowl), and El Paso (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton Bowl) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term \"bowl\" for any major American football game was well established.\nThe Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game, Super BowlI.\nAfter the American Football League's inaugural season, AFL commissioner Joe Foss sent an invitation to the NFL on January 14, 1961, to schedule a \"World Playoff\" game between the two leagues' champions, beginning with the upcoming 1961 season.[5] The first World Playoff game would have, if actually played, matched up the Houston Oilers vs. the Green Bay Packers. It took a half-dozen more seasons for this idea to become a reality.\nIn the mid-1960s, Lamar Hunt, owner of the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs, first used the term \"Super Bowl\"[6] to refer to the AFL\u2013NFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a Super Ball toy;[7] a vintage example of the ball is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, \"I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.\"\nThe leagues' owners chose the name \"AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game\",[8] but in July 1966 the Kansas City Star quoted Hunt in discussing \"the Super Bowl\u2014that's my term for the championship game between the two leagues\",[9] and the media immediately began using the term.[10] Although the league stated in 1967 that \"not many people like it\", asking for suggestions and considering alternatives such as \"Merger Bowl\" and \"The Game\", the Associated Press reported that \"Super Bowl\" \"grew and grew and grew\u2014until it reached the point that there was Super Week, Super Sunday, Super Teams, Super Players, ad infinitum\".[8] \"Super Bowl\" became official beginning with the third annual game.[11]\nThe winning team receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the coach of the Green Bay Packers, who won the first two Super Bowl games as well as five NFL championships preceding the merger in 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966 and 1967. Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named after him. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in Super Bowl V in Miami.\nThe Super Bowl is played on the second Sunday in February.[13] The current NFL schedule begins on the weekend immediately after Labor Day (the first Monday in September). That weekend is the first of an 18-week regular season, followed by three weeks of playoff games and one week for the Pro Bowl. The Super Bowl is contested the week after the Pro Bowl. This schedule has been in effect since an 18th week (and 17th regular season game) were added to the NFL schedule for the 2021 season, with Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, the first to be played under this format.\nThe Super Bowl was held in January from its inception until 2002, when the week of games following the September 11 attacks were postponed and rescheduled, extending the season by a week and causing Super Bowl XXXVI to be played on February 3. Beginning with Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, the Super Bowl was scheduled for the first Sunday in February until the schedule expansion of the 2021 season moved the game to the second Sunday.\nThe Patriots own the record for most Super Bowl appearances (eleven). The Cowboys, Steelers, and Denver Broncos are tied for second with eight appearances apiece, reaching that milestone in this respective order. Bill Belichickowns the record for the most Super Bowl wins (eight) and appearances (twelve: nine times as head coach, once as assistant head coach, and twice as defensive coordinator) by an individual. Tom Brady has the most Super Bowl starts (ten) and wins as a player (seven), while Charles Haley has the second-most wins among players (five).\nEight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The Minnesota Vikings were the first team to appear four times without a win, while the Buffalo Bills played in a record four consecutive Super Bowls, losing in each. The Patriots and Broncos are tied for the most Super Bowl losses (five).\nThe Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Jacksonville Jaguars are the four teams to have never appeared in a Super Bowl, although the Browns and Lions both won NFL Championships before the Super Bowl era. The Jaguars, who began play in 1995, and the Texans, who began play in 2002, are among the youngest franchises in the league.\nThe Packers won the first two AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Games, later renamed Super Bowls, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders following the 1966 and 1967 seasons, respectively. The Packers were led by quarterback Bart Starr, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for both games. These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the second threepeat in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967). The Packers are the only team to threepeat, as they also accomplished the feat in the pre-playoff era (1929, 1930 and 1931). The first playoff game in the NFL was in 1932.\nIn Super Bowl III, the AFL's New York Jets defeated the 19 1\u20442 points favorite Baltimore Colts of the NFL, 16\u20137. The Jets were led by quarterback Joe Namath, who had famously guaranteed a Jets win before the game, and former Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank, and their victory proved that the AFL was the NFL's competitive equal. This was reinforced the following year when the Chiefs defeated the NFL's Vikings 23\u20137 in Super Bowl IV.\nAfter the AFL\u2013NFL merger was completed in 1970, three franchises\u2014the Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, and Steelers\u2014would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls, between them in the decade. With the Steelers winning four of the eight.\nThe Baltimore Colts, now a member of the AFC, would start the decade by defeating the Cowboys in Super Bowl V, a game which is notable as being the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing team won the Super Bowl MVP (Cowboys' linebacker Chuck Howley). Beginning with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's championship game.\nThe Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years.\nThe Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won Super Bowl VI over the Dolphins. However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss for over a year, as the next year, the Dolphins would go 14\u20130 in the regular season and eventually win all their playoff games, capped off with a 14\u20137 victory in Super Bowl VII, becoming the first and only team to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason. The Dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning Super Bowl VIII a year later.\nThe Steelers' 1970s dynasty was interrupted only by the Raiders' first Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XI and the Cowboys' second Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XII. Conversely, the Vikings, with their Purple People Eaters defense, were the only other team to appear in multiple Super Bowls (IV, VIII, IX and XI) during the decade but failed to win each one.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s. The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXXI.\nThe 49ers against the Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX\nThe most successful team of the 1980s was the 49ers, which featured the West Coast offense of Hall of Fame head coach Bill Walsh. This offense was led by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, running back Roger Craig, and Hall of Fame defensive safety/cornerback Ronnie Lott. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the decade (XVI, XIX, XXIII, and XXIV) and made nine playoff appearances between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL. The 1984 San Francisco 49ers were the first team to achieve an 18\u20131 record, doing so under Walsh. The 1989 San Francisco 49ers, under first-year head coach George Seifert, posted the most lop-sided victory in Super Bowl history, defeating the Denver Broncos by a score of 55\u201310 in Super Bowl XXIV.\nConversely, the Cincinnati Bengals (XVI and XXIII), Dolphins, (XVII and XIX), and Broncos (XXI, XXII and XXIV) made multiple Super Bowls in the 1980s without winning one.\nFollowing several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the Cowboys rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997. From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year. In this same period, the Buffalo Bills had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, only to lose all four (XXV-XXVIII). After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX) led by quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, and wide receiver Michael Irvin. All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who were the first team to win their league-leading fifth title overall with Super Bowl XXIX with a dominant performance featuring the Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young (who threw a Super Bowl record 6 touchdown passes), Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders; however, the Cowboys' victory in Super Bowl XXX the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with Sanders after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the 49ers. The NFC's winning streak was continued by the Packers led by Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre, won Super Bowl XXXI, their first championship since Super Bowl II in 1967.\nThe Patriots made their maiden Super Bowl appearances in XX (1985) and XXXI (1996) but lost both times. However, the turn of the century would soon bring hope and glory to the franchise.\nSuper Bowl XXXII saw quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis lead the Denver Broncos to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's thirteen-year winning streak. The following year, the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game. The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls. In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams\u2014the Steelers, Patriots, Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, and Indianapolis Colts\u2014accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010.\nThe Patriots playing against the Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX\nThe New England Patriots became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade. They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s Dallas Cowboys). In Super Bowl XXXVI, first-year starting quarterback Tom Brady led his team to a 20\u201317 upset victory over the St. Louis Rams, who two seasons earlier won Super Bowl XXXIV. Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots also won Super Bowls XXXVIII[15] and XXXIX defeating the Carolina Panthers and the Philadelphia Eagles respectively. This four-year stretch of Patriot dominance was interrupted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 48\u201321 Super Bowl XXXVII victory over the Oakland Raiders.\nThe Steelers and Colts continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls XL and XLI in 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, respectively defeating the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears.\nIn the 2007 season, the Patriots became the fourth team in NFL history to have a perfect unbeaten and untied regular-season record, the second in the Super Bowl era after the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16\u20130. They easily marched through the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in Super Bowl XLII. However, they lost that game to Eli Manning and the New York Giants 17\u201314, leaving the Patriots' 2007 record at 18\u20131.\nThe following season, the Steelers logged their record sixth Super Bowl title (XLIII) in a 27\u201323, final-minute victory against the Arizona Cardinals.\nThe 2009 season saw the New Orleans Saints defeat the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV by a score of 31\u201317 to take home their first Championship. With this victory, the Saints joined the New York Jets as the only teams to have won in their sole Super Bowl appearance, a distinction the Ravens also enjoyed in winning Super Bowl XXXV after the 2000 season and the Buccaneers in 2002.\nIn the AFC, this era was dominated by the Patriots, with the only four other teams to represent the conference being the Steelers, Ravens, Broncos, and Chiefs. The Patriots had tied a record with the 1970s Dallas Cowboys for most Super Bowl appearances in a decade with five appearances (2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018). The Patriots also had four Super Bowl appearances in five years. With eight consecutive AFC championship appearances spanning 2011\u20132018, the Patriots were three wins away (2012, 2013, 2015) from eight Super Bowl appearances in the 2010s decade.\nThe Super Bowls of the 2000s and 2010s are notable for the performances (and the pedigrees) of several of the participating quarterbacks, especially on the AFC side in repeated appearances by the same teams and players. In particular, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, or Peyton Manning appeared as the AFC team's quarterback in all but two of the Super Bowls from 2001 through 2018. Conversely, the only NFC teams to make the Super Bowl multiple times with the same quarterback in this era were the Seahawks, led by quarterback Russell Wilson, and the Giants, led by quarterback Eli Manning.\nOne of these teams was featured in the culmination of the 2010 season, Super Bowl XLV, which brought the Packers their fourth Super Bowl victory and record thirteenth NFL championship overall with the defeat of the Steelers in February 2011. This became Aaron Rodgers' only Super Bowl victory so far.\nThe following year, in Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots made their first appearance of the decade, a position where they would become a mainstay. The Patriots, however, lost to the Eli Manning-led Giants, 21\u201317, who had beaten the Patriots four years before. This was the Giants' 4th Super Bowl victory.\nIn Super Bowl XLVII, the NFC's 49ers were defeated by the Ravens 34\u201331. The game had been dubbed as the 'Harbaugh Bowl' in the weeks leading up to the game, due to the fact that the coaches of the two teams, John Harbaugh and Jim Harbaugh, are brothers. During the 3rd quarter, the Ravens had a commanding 28\u20136 lead. However, there was a blackout in New Orleans, where the game was being played. The game was delayed for 34 minutes, and after play resumed, San Francisco stormed back with 17 straight points, but still lost.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII, played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in February 2014, was the first Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold-weather environment. The Seahawks won their first NFL title with a 43\u20138 defeat of the Broncos, in a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.\nIn Super Bowl XLIX, the Patriots beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Seahawks, by a score of 28\u201324. Down by 10, the Patriots mounted a late 4th quarter comeback to win the game with Tom Brady scoring two touchdowns in the 4th quarter. In a key play in the final seconds of the game, then-rookie free agent Malcolm Butler would intercept a pass by Russell Wilson at the one-yard line, allowing the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game. Tom Brady was awarded his 3rd Super Bowl MVP, tying Joe Montana for the most Super Bowl MVP awards.\nIn Super Bowl 50, the first Super Bowl to be branded with Arabic numerals, the Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, defeated the Panthers, who had the league's top-ranked offense, in what became the final game of quarterback Peyton Manning's career. Von Miller dominated, totaling 2.5 sacks and forcing two Cam Newton fumbles; both fumbles leading to Broncos touchdowns.\nIn Super Bowl LI, the first Super Bowl to end in overtime, the Atlanta Falcons led 28\u20133 late in the third quarter; however, they squandered the lead as the Patriots would tie the game 28\u201328 on back to back touchdowns and two-point conversions. The Falcons lost to the Patriots 34\u201328 in overtime. This 25-point deficit would be the largest comeback win for any team in a Super Bowl, breaking the previous of 10-point deficit to come back and win. The Patriots never held the lead until the game-winning touchdown in overtime. Tom Brady was awarded his record fourth Super Bowl MVP and 5th win as a Super Bowl Champion, throwing a then-record 466 yards for 43 completions.\nIn Super Bowl LII, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the defending champion, Patriots, 41\u201333, ending a 57-year championship drought for the franchise. Nick Foles won the Super Bowl MVP. The Patriots totaled 613 yards in defeat, with Tom Brady breaking his previous Super Bowl record of 466 passing yards with an all-time playoff record of 505 passing yards in the high-scoring game; while the Eagles would gain 538 yards in the victory. The combined total of 1,151 yards of offense for both teams broke an NFL record (for any game) that had stood for nearly seven decades. The Patriots' 33 points were the highest losing score in Super Bowl history, a record held until 2023, when the Eagles lost Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 38/35. It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance and their first win in franchise history. With the Eagles' victory, the NFC East became the first division to have each team win at least one Super Bowl.\nWhile Super Bowl LII produced the second highest-scoring Super Bowl, the following year's Super Bowl LIII became the lowest-scoring Super Bowl. The Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams, 13\u20133. In so doing, they became the team with the lowest point total by a winning team in Super Bowl history. Tom Brady would receive a record sixth Super Bowl championship, the most of any player in NFL history, surpassing his tie with Charles Haley for five wins. Brady would also become the oldest player to ever win a Super Bowl at age 41, while Bill Belichick would be the oldest coach to ever win a Super Bowl at age 66. Wide receiver Julian Edelman was named Super Bowl MVP.\nIn Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in a comeback, 31\u201320, for their first Super Bowl title in 50 years. This victory marked the first time since 1991 that the NFC did not have more Super Bowl victories than the AFC. Notable was the absence of the Patriots, who after making it to the Super Bowl the last three years and winning two of them, had lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs, being bested by the Tennessee Titans 20\u201313. That game represented Tom Brady's final game as a New England Patriot.\nIn Super Bowl LV, which took place in Tampa, Florida, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated defending champion, Chiefs, 31\u20139.[16] No player on the Buccaneers who scored points (Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, Leonard Fournette and Ryan Succop) was on the Buccaneers' roster the previous season. This marked a record seventh Super Bowl victory for Tom Brady, also more than any individual NFL franchise, and who would also break his own record for the oldest quarterback to win a championship at 43 years old. Tampa Bay head coach Bruce Arians would also break Bill Belichick's record for the oldest head coach to win a championship at 68. Super Bowl LV also marked the first time in the history of the modern league that a host city's professional football franchise got to play in a Super Bowl that was hosted in their home stadium. The following year saw the Los Angeles Rams defeat the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming the second team to win the Super Bowl in its home stadium.[17]\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.[19] The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the UEFA Champions League final.[19] For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most-watched United States originating television program of the year.[20] The game tends to have a high Nielsen television rating, which is usually around a 40 rating and 60 shares. This means that, on average, more than 100 million people from the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment.\nIn press releases preceding the game, the NFL has claimed that the upcoming Super Bowl will have a potential worldwide audience of around one billion people in over 200 countries.[21] However, this figure refers to the number of people able to watch the game, not the number of people who will actually be watching. Regardless, the statements have been frequently misinterpreted in the media as referring to the latter figure, leading to a misperception about the game's actual global audience.[22][23] The New York-based media research firm Initiative measured the global audience for the Super Bowl XXXIX at 93 million people, with 98 percent of that figure being viewers in North America, which meant roughly two million people outside North America watched the Super Bowl that year.[22]\nSuper Bowl XLIX holds the record for average number of US viewers, with 114.4 million, making the game the most-viewed television broadcast of any kind in American history.[20][24] The halftime show set a record with 118.5 million viewers tuning in.[25] Super Bowl XLIX peaked at 120.8 million viewers.[25] The game set a record for total viewers for the fifth time in six years.[citation needed]\nThe highest-rated game according to Nielsen was Super Bowl XVI in 1982, which was watched in 49.1% of households (73 shares), or 40,020,000 households at the time. Ratings for that game, a San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, may have been aided by a large blizzard that had affected much of the northeastern United States on game day, leaving residents to stay at home more than usual.[citation needed] Super Bowl XVI still ranks fourth on Nielsen's list of top-rated programs of all time, with three other Super Bowls (XVII, XX, and XLIX) in the top ten.\nFamous Super Bowl commercials include the 1984 introduction of Apple's Macintosh computer, the Budweiser \"Bud Bowl\" campaign, and the dot-com ads aired during Super Bowl XXXIV. As the television ratings of the Super Bowl have steadily increased over the years, commercial prices have also increased, with advertisers paying as much as $7 million for a thirty-second spot during Super Bowl LVI in 2022.[26] A segment of the audience tunes into the Super Bowl solely to view commercials.[27] In 2010, Nielsen reported that 51 percent of Super Bowl viewers tune in for the commercials.[28]\nSince 1991, the Super Bowl has begun between 6:19 and 6:40 PM EST so that most of the game is played during the primetime hours on the East Coast.[29]\nThroughout most of its history, the Super Bowl has been rotated annually between the same American television networks that broadcast the NFL's regular season and postseason games.\nSuper Bowl I, played in 1967, is the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the United States by two different broadcasters simultaneously. At the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game, and each network used its own announcers, but NBC was only allowed to use the CBS feed instead of producing its own.[30][31]\nBeginning with Super Bowl II, NBC televised the game in even years and CBS in odd years. This annual rotation between the two networks continued through the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger when NBC was given the rights to televise AFC games and CBS winning the rights to broadcast NFC games. Although ABC began broadcasting Monday Night Football in 1970, it was not added to the Super Bowl rotation until Super Bowl XIX, played in 1985. ABC, CBS and NBC then continued to rotate the Super Bowl until 1994, when Fox replaced CBS as the NFC broadcaster. CBS then took NBC's place in the rotation after the former replaced the later as the AFC broadcaster in 1998. As a result of new contracts signed in 2006, with NBC taking over Sunday Night Football from ESPN, and Monday Night Football moving from ABC to ESPN, NBC took ABC's place in the Super Bowl rotation. The rotation between CBS, Fox, and NBC will continue until the new contracts that will take effect for the first time with Super Bowl LVIII, allowing ABC to return and starting a four-network rotation.[32]\nThe four-year rotation beginning with Super Bowl LVIII also allows each broadcaster to offer simulcasts or alternative broadcasts on its sister networks and platforms.[32] CBS's sister network Nickelodeon is planning to air an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII.[33] And ABC's rights include ESPN simulcasts and alternative broadcasts on other ESPN networks.[32]\nThe first six Super Bowls were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place. Super Bowl VII (1973) was telecast in Los Angeles on an experimental basis after all tickets were sold ten days before the game.[37]\nGame analyst John Madden is the only person to broadcast a Super Bowl for each of the four networks that have televised the game (five with CBS, three with Fox, two with ABC, and one with NBC).\nNote: Years listed are the year the game was actually played (will be played[\u02c7]) rather than what NFL season it is considered to have been. ^*: The current TV contract with the networks expires after the 2022 season (or Super Bowl LVII in early 2023). Under the deal, the Super Bowl is currently rotated annually between CBS, Fox, and NBC in that order. ABC will return to the rotation in the upcoming contract, which is scheduled to take effect at the start of the 2023 season.[32] ^**: The first Super Bowl was simultaneously broadcast by CBS and NBC, with each network using the same video feed (from CBS), but providing its own commentary.\nThe Super Bowl provides an extremely strong lead-in to programming following it on the same channel, the effects of which can last for several hours. For instance, in discussing the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo television critic Alan Pergament noted that following Super Bowl XLVII, which aired on CBS: \"A paid program that ran on CBS4 (WIVB-TV) at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 rating. That's higher than some CW prime time shows get on WNLO-TV, Channel 4's sister station.\"[38]\nBecause of this strong coattail effect, the network that airs the Super Bowl typically takes advantage of the large audience to air an episode of a hit series or to premiere the pilot of a promising new one in the lead-out slot, which immediately follows the Super Bowl and post-game coverage.\nInitially, it was sort of a novelty and so it didn't quite feel right. But it was just like, this is the year... Bands of our generation, you can sort of be seen on a stage like this or, like, not seen. There's not a lot of middle places. It is a tremendous venue.\n\u2014 Bruce Springsteen on why he turned down several invitations to perform at the Super Bowl before finally agreeing to appear in Super Bowl XLIII[39]\nJennifer Hudson sings the national anthem at Super Bowl XLIIIClosing the opening ceremony of the Super Bowl 50\nThe U.S. national anthem has been performed at all but one Super Bowl: Super Bowl XI in 1977 when Vikki Carr sang \"America the Beautiful\" in place of the anthem. Beginning with Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, \"America the Beautiful\" is sung before the national anthem every year and is followed by the presentation of the colors and a military flyover preceded the anthem. Beginning with Super Bowl LV in 2021, \"Lift Every Voice And Sing\" the national anthem in honor of Black History Month, is sung prior to \"America the Beautiful\".\nUnlike regular season or playoff games, thirty minutes are allocated for the Super Bowl halftime. After a special live episode of the Fox sketch comedy series In Living Color caused a drop in viewership for the Super Bowl XXVI halftime show, the NFL sought to increase the Super Bowl's audience by hiring A-list talent to perform. They approached Michael Jackson, whose performance the following year drew higher figures than the game itself.[44][45] Another notable performance came during Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002, when U2 performed; during their third song, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", the band played under a large projection screen which scrolled through names of the victims of the September 11 attacks.\nThe halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII attracted controversy, following an incident in which Justin Timberlake removed a piece of Janet Jackson's top, briefly exposing one of her breasts before the broadcast quickly cut away from the shot. The incident led to fines being issued by the FCC (and a larger crackdown over \"indecent\" content broadcast on television), and MTV (then a sister to the game's broadcaster that year, CBS, under Viacom) being banned by the NFL from producing the Super Bowl halftime show in the future. In an effort to prevent a repeat of the incident, the NFL held a moratorium on Super Bowl halftime shows featuring pop performers, and instead invited a single, headlining veteran act, such as Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. This practice ended at Super Bowl XLV, which returned to using current pop acts such as The Black Eyed Peas, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga.[46][47]\nAnnouncer Alan Roach has handled public address announcing duties for the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL in 2006, with the exceptions of Super Bowl XLVIII and 50 when the Denver Broncos played in those games. Roach was also Denver's regular P.A. announcer during those years, and thus the league felt it was a potential competitive advantage.[48]\nSeven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after Super Bowl XXVII's host stadium was selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home stadium in the same city; for example, five of Los Angeles's Bowls were played at the Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl. Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.\nTraditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[52] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area\u2014Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis\u2014Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in the New York area\u2014Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium. Only MetLife Stadium did not have a roof (be it fixed or retractable) but it was still picked as the host stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in an apparent waiver of the warm-climate rule, with a contingency plan to reschedule the game in the event of heavy snowfall.[53] MetLife Stadium's selection over Sun Life Stadium generated controversy as the league requested a roof to be added to Sun Life Stadium (in the event of rainstorms) in order to be considered for future Super Bowls.[54]\nThere have been a few instances where the league has rescinded the Super Bowl from cities. Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 was originally awarded to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, but after Arizona voters elected not to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a paid state employees' holiday in 1990, the NFL moved the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[55] When voters in Arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992, Super Bowl XXX in 1996 was awarded to Tempe. Super Bowl XXXIII was awarded first to Candlestick Park in San Francisco, but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through, the game was moved to Pro Player Stadium in greater Miami. Super Bowl XXXVII was awarded to a new stadium not yet built in San Francisco, when that stadium failed to be built, the game was moved to Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[56] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\nThe location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[57]\nThrough Super Bowl LVI, teams were allowed to bid for the rights to host Super Bowls, where cities submitted proposals to host a Super Bowl and were evaluated in terms of stadium renovation and their ability to host, but this competition was rescinded in 2018.[needs update][52][58] The league has made all decisions regarding hosting sites from Super Bowl LVII onward; the league chose a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team put together a hosting proposal, and the league voted upon it to determine if it is acceptable.[59]\nIn 2014, a document listing the specific requirements of Super Bowl hosts was leaked, giving a clear list of what was required for a Super Bowl host.[60] Some of the host requirements include:\nThe host stadium must be in a market that hosts an NFL team and must have a minimum of 70,000 seats, with the media and electrical amenities necessary to produce the Super Bowl. Stadiums may include temporary seating for Super Bowls, but seating must be approved by the league. Stadiums where the average game day temperature is below 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) must either have a roof or a waiver given by the league. There must be a minimum of 35,000 parking spaces within one mile of the stadium.\nThe host stadium must have space for the Gameday Experience, a large pregame entertainment area, within walking distance of the stadium.\nThe host city must have space for the NFL Experience, the interactive football theme park which is operated the week before the Super Bowl. An indoor venue for the event must have a minimum of 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2), and an outdoor venue must have a minimum of 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2). Additionally, there must be space nearby for the Media Center, and space for all other events involved in the Super Bowl week, including golf courses and bowling alleys.\nThe necessary infrastructure must be in place around the stadium and other Super Bowl facilities, including parking, security, electrical needs, media needs, communication needs, and transportation needs.\nThere must be a minimum number of hotel spaces within one hour's drive of the stadium equaling 35% of the stadium's capacity, along with hotels for the teams, officials, media, and other dignitaries. (For Super Bowl XXXIX, the city of Jacksonville docked several luxury cruise liners at their port to act as temporary hotel space.[61])\nThere must be practice space of equal and comparable quality for both teams within a twenty-minute drive of the team hotels, and rehearsal space for all events within a reasonable distance to the stadium. The practice facilities must have one grass field and at least one field of the same surface as the host stadium.\nThe stadium must have a minimum of 70,000 fixed seats, including club and fixed suite seating, during regular season operations.\nMuch of the cost of a Super Bowl is to be assumed by the host community, although some costs are enumerated within the requirements to be assumed by the NFL. New Orleans, the site of Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game.[62]\nThe NFL allocates backup stadiums for the Super Bowl every year, in the event of a last-minute relocation of the game.[63]\nThe designated \"home team\" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.[64][65] This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Packers were the designated home team. Regardless of being the home or away team of record, each team has their team logo and wordmark painted in one of the end zones. Designated away teams have won 32 of 57 Super Bowls to date (approximately 56%).\nSince Super Bowl XIII in 1979, the home team is given the choice of wearing their colored or white jerseys. Originally, the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted in the Cowboys donning their less exposed[discuss] dark blue jerseys for Super Bowl V. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been seven exceptions: the Cowboys during Super Bowls XIII and XXVII, the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII, the Steelers during Super Bowl XL, the Broncos during Super Bowl 50, the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and the Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. The Cowboys, since 1964, have worn white jerseys at home. The Washington Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992, continued by Richie Petitbon and Norv Turner through 2000, then again when Gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007. Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970, opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The Steelers' decision was compared with the Patriots in Super Bowl XX; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season, but after winning road playoff games against the Jets and Dolphins wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to scarlet for the Super Bowl as the designated home team. For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, Denver general manager John Elway simply stated, \"We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms\"; they previously had been 0\u20134 in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys.[66][67] The Broncos' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition, losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion. It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII. During the pairing of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games, but have worn white for a home game in the 2008, 2010, and 2011 seasons.[68] The Patriots were 3\u20130 in their white uniforms in Super Bowls before Super Bowl LII with Belichick and Brady,[69][70] and they may have been going on recent trends of teams who wear white for the Super Bowl game.[71][72][73] For Super Bowl LV, when the Buccaneers became the first team to reach the Super Bowl that their own stadium hosted, the Bucs coincidentally were designated the home team as per AFC-NFC rotation and elected to wear their white jerseys, having previously won both their divisional and championship post-season games on the road in white jerseys.[74] White-shirted teams have won 37 of 57 Super Bowls to date (65%). The only teams to win in their dark-colored uniform in more recent years are the Packers against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, the Eagles against the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and the Chiefs against the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV.[75] Since Super Bowl XXXIX, teams in white jerseys have won 16 of the last 19 Super Bowls.\nThe 49ers, as part of the league's 75th Anniversary celebration, used their 1955 throwback uniform in Super Bowl XXIX, which for that year was their regular home jersey. The Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII wore their royal blue and yellow uniforms, which was a throwback uniform but then turned into their primary colors over the navy blue and metallic gold uniform, which they have previously worn for six home games including a home playoff game.[76] No team has yet worn a third jersey or Color Rush uniform for the Super Bowl. The 49ers reportedly requested to wear an all-white third jersey ensemble for Super Bowl LIV, which the San Francisco Chronicle noted they could do with special permission from the league; the league never granted such permission, and the 49ers instead opted for their standard uniform of white jerseys with gold pants.[77]\n^^: Stadium has since been demolished. ^\u2021: Prior to the incorporation of Miami Gardens in 2003, the stadium was in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. ^\u2020\u2020: The original Stanford Stadium, which hosted Super Bowl XIX, was demolished and a new stadium constructed on the site in 2006. ^\u02c7: Future Super Bowls, also denoted by italics.\nTime zone complications are a significant obstacle to a Super Bowl in London; a typical 6:30 p.m. EST start would result in the game beginning at 11:30 p.m. local time in London: this in an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports, while the NFL has never in its history started a game later than 9:15 p.m. local time.[84]\nAlthough bids have been submitted for all Super Bowls through Super Bowl LIX, the soonest that any stadium outside the NFL's footprint could serve as host would be Super Bowl LXI in 2027.[85]\nThe NFL very actively seeks to prevent what it calls unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms \"NFL\", \"Super Bowl\", and \"Super Bowl Sunday\".[86] As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with euphemisms such as \"The Big Game\", or other generic descriptions.[87][88] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying \"it would be super... to have a bowl... of Planters nuts while watching the big game!\" and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the \"Superb Owl\". In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for \"Superb Owl\".[89] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase \"Super Bowl\" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that \"promote a message\", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55 inches.[90] Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that \"any use is prohibited\", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States.[90] Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 \"to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games\", and \"for other purposes\".[91]\nIn 2004, the NFL started issuing cease-and-desist letters to casinos in Las Vegas that were hosting Super Bowl parties. \"Super Bowl\" is a registered trademark, owned by the NFL, and any other business using that name for profit-making ventures is in violation of federal law, according to the letters. In reaction to the letters, many Las Vegas resorts, rather than discontinue the popular and lucrative parties, started referring to them as \"Big Game Parties\".[92][93][94]\n1 \u2013 Dates in the list denote the season, not necessarily the calendar year in which the championship game was played. For instance, Super Bowl LIV was played in 2020, but was the championship for the 2019 season.\n2 \u2013 From 1966 to 1969, the first four Super Bowls were \"World Championship\" games played between two independent professional football leagues, AFL and NFL, and when the league merged in 1970 the Super Bowl became the NFL Championship Game.",

        "context": "\nWoodrow Wilson giving his first State of the Union address; the first time since 1801 that such an address was made in person before a joint session of Congress,[1] this initiated the modern trend with regards to the State of the Union address.[2]\nThe State of the Union Address (sometimes abbreviated to SOTU) is an annual message delivered by the president of the United States to a joint session of the United States Congress near the beginning of most calendar years on the current condition of the nation.[3][4] The State of the Union Address generally includes reports on the nation's budget, economy, news, agenda, progress, achievements and the president's priorities and legislative proposals.[5]\nThe address fulfills the requirement in Article II, Section 3, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution for the president to periodically \"give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\"[3] During most of the country's first century, the president primarily submitted only a written report to Congress. After 1913, Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. president, began the regular practice of delivering the address to Congress in person as a way to rally support for the president's agenda, while also submitting a more detailed report.[3] With the advent of radio and television, the address is now broadcast live in all United States time zones on many networks.[6]\nThe speech is generally held in January or February, and an invitation to the president is extended to use the chamber of the House by the speaker of the House. Starting in 1981, Ronald Reagan, the 40th U.S. president, began the practice of newly inaugurated presidents delivering an address to Congress in the first year of their term but not designating that speech an official \"State of the Union\".[7]\nThough the language of the clause is not specific, since the 1930s, the president has made this report annually in late January or early February. Between 1934 and 2022 the date has been as early as January 3,[7] and as late as March 1.[9]\nWhile not required to deliver a speech, every president since Woodrow Wilson, with the notable exception of Herbert Hoover,[2] has made at least one State of the Union report as a speech delivered before a joint session of Congress. Before then, most presidents delivered the State of the Union as a written report.[7]\nWhat began as a communication between president and Congress has become in effect a communication between the president and the people of the United States. Since the advent of radio, and then television, the speech has been broadcast live in all United States time zones on most networks, preempting scheduled programming. Since at least the 1960s, in order to reach the largest audience, the speech has typically been given at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time, UTC-5).[10]\nGeorge Washington delivered the first regular annual message before a joint session of Congress on January 8, 1790, in New York City, then the provisional U.S. capital. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson discontinued the practice of delivering the address in person, regarding it as too monarchical (similar to the Speech from the Throne). Instead, the address was written and then sent to Congress to be read by a clerk until 1913 when Woodrow Wilson re-established the practice despite some initial controversy, and an in-person address to Congress has been delivered nearly every year since. However, there have been exceptions to this rule, with some messages being given solely in writing, and others given both in writing and orally (either in a speech to Congress or through broadcast media).[11] The last president to give a written message without a spoken address was Jimmy Carter in 1981, days before his term ended after his defeat by Ronald Reagan.[11]\nFor many years, the speech was referred to as \"the President's Annual Message to Congress\".[12] The actual term \"State of the Union\" first emerged in 1934 when Franklin D. Roosevelt used the phrase, becoming its generally accepted name since 1947.[12]\nPrior to 1934, the annual message was delivered at the end of the calendar year, in December. The ratification of the 20th Amendment on January 23, 1933, changed the opening of Congress from early March to early January, affecting the delivery of the annual message. Since 1934, the message or address has been delivered to Congress in January or February.[13]\nThe Twentieth Amendment also established January 20 as the beginning of the presidential term. In years when a new president is inaugurated, the outgoing president may deliver a final State of the Union message, but none has done so since Jimmy Carter sent a written message in 1981. In 1953 and 1961, Congress received both a written State of the Union message from the outgoing president and a separate State of the Union speech by the incoming president. Since 1981, in recognition that the responsibility of reporting the State of the Union formally belongs to the president who held office during the past year, newly inaugurated presidents have not officially called their first speech before Congress a \"State of the Union\" message.[12]\nThe text of the first page of Ronald Reagan's first State of the Union Address, given January 26, 1982\nWarren Harding's 1922 speech was the first to be broadcast on radio, albeit to a limited audience,[14] while Calvin Coolidge's 1923 speech was the first to be broadcast across the nation.[4] President Roosevelt's address in 1936 was the first delivered in the evening,[15] but this precedent was not followed again until the 1960s. Harry S. Truman's 1947 address was the first to be broadcast on television. In 1968, television networks in the United States for the first time imposed no time limit for their coverage of a State of the Union address. Delivered by Lyndon B. Johnson, this address was followed by extensive televised commentary by, among others, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Milton Friedman.[16]Bill Clinton's 1997 address was the first broadcast available live on the World Wide Web.[17]\nIn 1999, Bill Clinton became the first president to deliver an in-person State of the Union address while standing trial for impeachment; the speech occurred the same day that Clinton's defense team made its opening statement in Clinton's impeachment trial, though he did not mention the proceeding.[20]\nBecause the address is made to a joint session of Congress, the House and Senate must each pass a resolution setting a date and time for the joint session. Then, a formal invitation is made by the speaker of the House to the president typically several weeks before the appointed date.[24][25]\nEvery member of Congress can bring one guest to the State of the Union address. The president may invite up to 24 guests to be seated in a box with the First Lady. The speaker of the House may invite up to 24 guests in the speaker's box. Seating for Congress on the main floor is by a first-in, first-served basis with no reservations. The Cabinet, Supreme Court justices, members of the Diplomatic Corps, and military leaders (the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Commandant of the Coast Guard) have reserved seating.[26]\nBy approximately 8:30 p.m. on the night of the address, the members of the House have gathered in their seats for the joint session.[27] Then, the Deputy Sergeant at Arms addresses the speaker and loudly announces the vice president and members of the Senate, who enter and take the seats assigned for them.[27]\nThe speaker, and then the vice president, specify the members of the House and Senate, respectively, who will escort the president into the House chamber.[27] The Deputy Sergeant at Arms addresses the speaker again and loudly announces, in order, the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, the Chief Justice of the United States and the Associate Justices, and the Cabinet, each of whom enters and takes their seats when called.[27] The justices take the seats nearest to the speaker's rostrum and adjacent to the sections reserved for the Cabinet and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[28]\nJust after 9:00 pm, as the president reaches the door to the chamber,[29] the House Sergeant at Arms stands just inside the doors, faces the speaker, and waits until the president is ready to enter the chamber.[28] When the president is ready, the Sergeant at Arms announces the entrance, loudly stating the phrase: \"Mister [or Madam] Speaker, the president of the United States!\"[29]\nAs applause and cheering begin, the president slowly walks toward the speaker's rostrum, followed by members of the congressional escort committee.[29] The president's approach is slowed by pausing to shake hands, hug, kiss, and autograph copies of the speech for Members of Congress.[28] After taking a place at the House Clerk's desk,[29] the president hands two manila envelopes, previously placed on the desk and containing copies of the speech, to the speaker and vice president.[citation needed]\nAfter continuing applause from the attendees has diminished, the speaker introduces the president to the representatives and senators, typically stating: \"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"[28][29] This leads to a further round of applause and, eventually, the beginning of the address by the president.[29]\nCustomarily, one cabinet member (the designated survivor) does not attend the speech, in order to provide continuity in the line of succession if a catastrophe disables the president, the vice president, and other succeeding officers gathered in the House chamber. Additionally, since the September 11 attacks in 2001, a few members of Congress have been asked to relocate to undisclosed locations for the duration of the speech to form a rump Congress in the event of a disaster.[30] Since 2003, each chamber of Congress has formally named a separate designated survivor.[31][32]\nBoth the speaker and the vice president sit at the speaker's desk, behind the President for the duration of the speech. If either is unavailable, the next highest-ranking member of the respective house substitutes. Once the chamber settles down from the President's arrival, the speaker officially presents the President to the joint session of Congress. The president then delivers the speech from the podium at the front of the House Chamber.[33]\nFor the 2011 address, Senator Mark Udall of Colorado proposed a break in the tradition of seating Republicans and Democrats on opposite sides of the House;[34] this was in response to the 2011 Tucson Shooting in which Representative Gabby Giffords was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt.[35] Approximately 60 legislators signed on to Udall's proposal;[36] a similar plan for the 2012 address garnered bipartisan seating commitments from more than 160 lawmakers.[35] Efforts to intersperse the parties during the State of the Union have since waned, and by the 2016 address, seating had largely returned to the traditional partisan arrangement.[37]\nThe contents of the speeches typically contain information and status updates of the country and federal government during the incumbent president's administration.[38] It has become customary to use the phrase \"The State of the Union is strong,\" sometimes with slight variations, since President Ronald Reagan introduced it in his 1983 address.[39] It has been repeated by every president in nearly every year since, with the exception of George H. W. Bush.[39]Gerald Ford's 1975 address had been the first to use the phrasing \"The State of the Union is...\", though Ford completed the sentence with \"not good.\"[39]\nSince Reagan's 1982 address, it has also become common for presidents of both parties to honor special guests sitting in the gallery, such as American citizens or visiting heads of state.[40] During that 1982 address, Reagan acknowledged Lenny Skutnik for his act of heroism following the crash of Air Florida Flight 90.[41] Since then, the term \"Lenny Skutniks\" has been used to refer to individuals invited to sit in the gallery, and then cited by the president, during the State of the Union.[42][43]\nState of the Union speeches usually last a little over an hour, partly because of the large amounts of applause that occur from the audience throughout. The applause is often political in tone, with many portions of the speech being applauded only by members of the president's own party. As non-political officeholders, members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality. In recent years, the presiding officers of the House and the Senate, the speaker and the vice president, respectively, have departed from the neutrality expected of presiding officers of deliberative bodies, as they, too, stand and applaud in response to the remarks of the president with which they agree.[citation needed]\nSince 1966,[44] the speech has been followed on television by a response or rebuttal by a member of the major political party opposing the president's party. The response is typically broadcast from a studio with no audience. In 1970, the Democratic Party put together a TV program with their speech to reply to President Nixon, as well as a televised response to Nixon's written speech in 1973.[45] The same was done by Democrats for President Reagan's speeches in 1982 and 1985. The response is not always produced in a studio; in 1997, the Republicans for the first time delivered the response in front of high school students.[46] In 2010, Virginia GovernorBob McDonnell gave the Republican response from the House of Delegates chamber of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, in front of about 250 attendees.[47]\nAlthough much of the pomp and ceremony behind the State of the Union address is governed by tradition rather than law, in modern times, the event is seen as one of the most important in the US political calendar. It is one of the few instances when all three branches of the US government are assembled under one roof: members of both houses of Congress constituting the legislature, the president's Cabinet constituting the executive, and the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court constituting the judiciary. In addition, the military is represented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while foreign governments are represented by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. The address has also been used as an opportunity to honor the achievements of some ordinary Americans, who are typically invited by the president to sit with the First Lady.[43]\nDuring his State of the Union Address on January 11, 1944, FDR proposed the Second Bill of Rights. Roosevelt's argument was that the \"political rights\" guaranteed by the constitution and the Bill of Rights had \"proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness\".[58] This was technically a \"Message\" and not a speech, as Roosevelt had \"a case of the grippe\" and could not come; there was no joint session, and the Clerk of the Senate read the message. (Although he did manage to read it as a Fireside Chat over the radio, from his office that same day.)[59]\nDuring his State of the Union address on January 15, 1975, Gerald R. Ford very bluntly stated that \"the state of the Union is not good: Millions of Americans are out of work...We depend on others for essential energy. Some people question their Government's ability to make hard decisions and stick with them; they expect Washington politics as usual.\" Ford said he did not \"expect much if any, applause. The American people want action, and it will take both the Congress and the president to give them what they want. Progress and solutions can be achieved, and they will be achieved.\"[62]\nGeorge W. Bush delivering the 2002 State of the Union\nDuring his State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, President Bush identified North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as representing significant threats to the United States. He said, \"States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world\". In this speech, he would outline the objectives for the War on Terror.[63]\n^Sincere, Richard E. Jr. (February 1997). \"O.J., J.C., and Bill: Reflections on the State of the Union\". Metro Herald.

        "context": "\nThe Ballon d'Or (French pronunciation:[bal\u0254\u0303d\u0254\u0281]\u24d8; lit.'Golden Ball') is an annual football award presented by French news magazine France Football since 1956 and co-organized alongside UEFA since 2024. Between 2010 and 2015, in an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year (founded in 1991) and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. That partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award The Best FIFA Men's Player. The recipients of the joint FIFA Ballon d'Or are considered as winners by both award organisations.[2] Nevertheless, in recent times, critics have described the award as a \"popularity contest\", criticising its voting process, its bias in favour of attacking players, and for the idea of systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.[note 1]\nConceived by sports writers Gabriel Hanot and Jacques Ferran, the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year, based on voting by football journalists, from 1956 to 2006.[2] Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin that have been active at European clubs.[9][10]\nAfter 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote.[2] The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible.[11] In 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. They changed the timing so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season.[12] It was also decided that only those countries in the top 100 of the FIFA World Ranking would be allowed to vote.[12]\nThe Ballon d\u2019Or has historically been regarded as football's most prestigious and valuable individual award.[13] Nevertheless, in recent times, critics have described the award as a \"popularity contest\", criticising its voting process, its bias in favour of attacking players, and for the idea of systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.[note 1][2]\nStanley Matthews of England was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or.[14] Prior to 2007, the award was generally known as the continental European Footballer of the Year award in English language and much international media. Even after 2007, it was usually identified with and referred to by that name because of its origin as a European award, until it was merged with FIFA's World Player award cementing its new worldwide claim.[15][16][17][18] Liberia's George Weah, the only African recipient, became the first non-European to win the award in 1995, the year that rules of eligibility were changed.[10]Ronaldo of Brazil became the first South American winner two years later.[10]\nLionel Messi has won the award a record eight times, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with five. Messi is the only player in history to win the award with three different teams and also the only one to win it while playing outside Europe.[19] Three players have won the award three times each: Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten. With seven awards each, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French players have won the second most Ballons d'Or, underneath Argentina in first with eight. Players from Germany (1972, 1981) and the Netherlands (1988) occupied the top-three top spots in a single year (a feat achieved only three times in history). German (1972) and Italian (1988\u20131990) clubs achieved the same feat, including two individual years dominated by AC Milan players (1988, 1989), a unique record until Spanish clubs experienced an unforeseen dominance (2009\u20132012, 2015, 2016) and Barcelona (2010) became the second club to occupy the top-three. Two Spanish clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid, also lead the ranking for producing the most winners, with 12 wins each.[20]\nBetween 2010 and 2015 inclusive, the award was merged with a similar one, the FIFA World Player of the Year award, to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or, which was awarded to the world's best male player before FIFA and France Football decided not to continue the merging agreement.[21] After 2011, UEFA created the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award to maintain the tradition of the original Ballon d'Or of specifically honouring a football player from Europe.[22]\nIn 2020, the Group L'\u00c9quipe, to which France Football belongs, decided that no award would be given for the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic cutting short the seasons of football clubs worldwide.[23] The widespread public opinion is that the 2020 award should have been given to Robert Lewandowski.[24][25][26]\nThe award shows a bias in favor of attacking players, which has increased in recent years, especially after 2007.[2] Over time, the award has gone to a more exclusive set of leagues and clubs.[2] Prior to 1995, 10 leagues supplied Ballon d'Or winners, whereas only England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have supplied winners since 1995.[2] Spain's La Liga has the most Ballon d'Or winners.[2] Barcelona and Real Madrid have supplied the most Ballon d'Or winners since 1995.[2]\nIn 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. They changed the timing so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season.[12] It was also decided that only those countries in the top 100 of the FIFA World Ranking would be allowed to vote. The plebiscite had previously been open to all countries since 2007. This brought the Ballon d'Or into line with the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award which was slightly less dominated by exclusive leagues and, in particular, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in recent years.[12]\nFrom 2024, UEFA will co-organize the Ballon D'or with France Football, with the magazine retaining the voting system and the Ballon d'Or name and UEFA organizing the awards gala.[27]\nLionel Messi has won the most Ballons d'Or in history, with eight wins in three different decades. He is also the record holder for most consecutive wins, with four between 2009 and 2012.\nNote: Until 2021, the Ballon d'Or was awarded based on player performance during the calendar year. Since 2022, jurors have been instructed to take into account the previous season.[28]\nCristiano Ronaldo has been nominated for the Ballon d'Or a record eighteen times, and is a five-time winner.[1]George Weah was the first non-European and first African national team player to win the award.Lev Yashin is the only goalkeeper to win the award.Franz Beckenbauer is the only defender to win the award twice.\nCristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi won 10 consecutive Ballon d'Or trophies between them from 2008 to 2017.Michel Platini won the award three years running (1983\u201385).Ronaldo Nazario is the youngest player to win the Ballon d'Or.Johan Cruyff (left) and Marco van Basten, both of the Netherlands, each won three times.\nIn addition Diego Maradona received an honorary Ballon d'Or in 1995 for his services to football dubbed the Golden Ballon d'Or.[32][33]Pel\u00e9 also received a similar award in January 2014 dubbed the FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or Prix d\u2019Honneur.[34]\nIn 2021 France Football awarded Robert Lewandowski with a Striker of the Year award for scoring the most goals the previous season. After Gerd M\u00fcller passing the award was renamed as the Gerd M\u00fcller Trophy.[36][37]\nA decade later, France Football voted Pel\u00e9 as the Football Player of the Century after consulting their former Ballon d'Or recipients. Among the 34 previous winners, 30 cast their votes, while Stanley Matthews, Omar S\u00edvori and George Best refused to vote, and Lev Yashin had died. Each voter was allotted five votes worth up to five points; however, Di St\u00e9fano only chose a first place, Platini a first and second place, and George Weah two players for fifth place. Pel\u00e9 was named the greatest by 17 voters, receiving almost double the number of points earned by the runner-up, Diego Maradona.[45][46]\nTo coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d'Or in 2016, France Football published a reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995, when only European players were eligible to win the award. 12 out of the 39 Ballons d'Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players; in addition to Pel\u00e9 and Diego Maradona, Garrincha, Mario Kempes, and Rom\u00e1rio were retrospectively recognized as worthy winners. The original recipients, however, remain unchanged.[47]",

He was signed as a replacement for Benfica's departing captain, Sim\u00e3o, who joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid earlier that summer.[16] Benfica paid Rosario Central \u20ac6 million for 80% of his sports rights and 50% of sports rights of Andr\u00e9s D\u00edaz.[18] Later, in August 2008, the Portuguese club paid an extra \u20ac2 million for the remaining 20%,[19] but re-sold 10% to GestiFute.[20] Di Mar\u00eda was signed by the Portuguese club with the intention of replacing Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa, who had just left the club to play for Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid.\nDi Mar\u00eda had his breakthrough in the 2009\u201310 season thanks to the trust placed in him by manager Jorge Jesus. On 22 October, in the Europa League group stage match against Everton, he provided an hat-trick of assist for the first time in his career, in a 5\u20130 thrashing at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz, marking the biggest loss of an English side in a European competition.[21][22] During that month, Di Mar\u00eda signed a new deal with Benfica, adding three more years to his current deal, which was to last until 30 June 2015 with his release fee set at a minimum of \u20ac40 million.[23] Afterwards, he was backed by Diego Maradona to become \"Argentina's next superstar\".[24] He would score a brace in Benfica's 2\u20131 home win over AEK Athens, to ensure Benfica's qualification to the round of thirty-two, as group winners.[25] On 27 February 2010, Di Mar\u00eda scored his first hat-trick in a classic 4\u20130 win against Leix\u00f5es. The next day, he made the headlines as \"Magic Tri Mar\u00eda\" in all sports newspapers in Portugal.[26] He finished as the league's top assister that season with 11 assists, including two in a 5\u20130 against Olhanense, as Benfica won the national championship, adding the year's domestic League Cup, while being named Player of the Month in April.[27]\nOn 28 June 2010, Real Madrid posted on their website that they had agreed with Benfica for the transfer of Di Mar\u00eda. He signed a five-year contract for \u20ac25 million, plus \u20ac11 million in incentives, as announced one day later by the Portuguese Stock Exchange regulating entity.[28] On 7 July 2010, Di Mar\u00eda arrived to Madrid directly from Buenos Aires,[29] and passed the medical test on 8 July.[30]\nHe made his debut on 4 August 2010 in a friendly match against Mexican side Am\u00e9rica, which Real Madrid won 3\u20132.[31] On 22 August, Di Mar\u00eda scored his first goal in another friendly away against H\u00e9rcules, which Real Madrid won 1\u20133.[32] In the last match of the pre-season, on 24 August, after an individual play described as a \"magic moment\", he opened the score of the 2\u20130 win against Pe\u00f1arol for the Trofeo Santiago Bernab\u00e9u.[33]\nDi Mar\u00eda scored Real Madrid's third goal during their first-leg Champions League quarter-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 April 2011.[38] On 20 April, he was sent off in the 31st minute of extra time in the Copa del Rey final against rival Barcelona. Real Madrid won the match 1\u20130, the lone goal of the match (in the 13th minute of extra time) being a header from Cristiano Ronaldo, which came from his cross, thus obtaining his first honour with Real Madrid.[39]\nDuring the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Di Mar\u00eda endured a tough series of matches as he struggled to adapt to the pace of the league following the summer break. As a result, Di Mar\u00eda's early performance for the season was mixed with moments of genuinely good play interspersed with moments of sheer madness by the Argentine. This point was well illustrated during Real Madrid's 1\u20130 defeat to Levante, a match which saw a clearly out-of-sorts Di Mar\u00eda commit a horror foul on Levante's Juanfran during the match. Di Mar\u00eda caused the two teams to clash and an on-field incident ensued. However, Di Mar\u00eda's performances would improve, including opening up a significant gap at the top of the assists table. From October 2011, Di Mar\u00eda was being picked by Madrid head coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ahead of Kak\u00e1 and Mesut \u00d6zil, a sign of his improving form.[citation needed]\nOn 27 November 2011, Di Mar\u00eda played 60 minutes in a league match against city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, in which he scored a goal for Real Madrid. Mourinho's team won the match 4\u20131. On 3 December 2011, Di Mar\u00eda scored Real's first goal from a sharp angle in a 3\u20130 defeat of Sporting de Gij\u00f3n in La Liga.[40] He was a constant threat and presence in the starting XI as Real Madrid won their 32nd league title, playing in their 3\u20130 win over Athletic Bilbao that clinched the league title.[41]\nAlthough Di Mar\u00eda did not have the best season, he did contribute in big moments, most notably by sending in the cross for Cristiano Ronaldo's goal against Manchester United on 13 February,[43] he registered seventeen assists, and scored nine goals throughout the season in 52 appearances, notably against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and M\u00e1laga. On 9 August 2012, Di Mar\u00eda signed a new contract with Real Madrid, keeping him at the club until 2018.[44]\nOn 2 October 2013, Di Mar\u00eda scored two goals against Copenhagen in Real Madrid's 4\u20130 Champions League victory over them.[citation needed] Later in the season, due to tactical decisions by the club's new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Di Mar\u00eda's playing position was permanently switched to that of an offensive\u2013minded central midfielder, and he was frequently deployed in the starting line-up alongside Luka Modri\u0107 and Xabi Alonso in midfield in the team's 4\u20133\u20133 formation.[45] He contributed to the club's 1\u20132 victory over Barcelona in the 2014 Copa del Rey Final with the opening goal.[46] Di Mar\u00eda was the top assist maker in La Liga for the season, contributing 17.[47]\nDi Mar\u00eda was an unused substitute as Real Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla on 12 August.[50] A week later, in the first leg of the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, he played the final 15 minutes of a 1\u20131 home draw against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in place of Luka Modri\u0107.[51][52]\nDi Mar\u00eda made his debut on 30 August in a 0\u20130 draw with Burnley, in which he was substituted for Anderson after 70 minutes.[58] He scored his first goal for United on 14 September, netting directly from a free-kick in a 4\u20130 win over Queens Park Rangers.[59][60] He also provided an assist for Juan Mata's goal in the same match, winning the vote for Man of the Match.[59] His performance was highlighted by Sky Sports' Player Cam feature, which was brought back especially for the match.[61] In the next match, against Leicester City on 21 September, he again scored a goal and provided another assist, although United lost the match 5\u20133.[62]\nOn 2 October, Di Mar\u00eda won Manchester United's Player of the Month award for September after recording two goals and two assists in his first four matches for the club.[63] One week later, he won his second individual trophy at United after his goal against Leicester, in which he chipped goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, was voted as the club's Goal of the Month for September.[64] Di Mar\u00eda continued his run of fine form on 5 October by scoring a goal and providing an assist for Radamel Falcao to help United defeat Everton 2\u20131.[65] Di Mar\u00eda was substituted with a hamstring injury 13 minutes into United's 3\u20130 defeat of Hull City on 29 November and subsequently made only one substitute appearance in the team's next seven matches.\nOn 4 January 2015, Di Mar\u00eda returned from injury to score a late goal in a 0\u20132 win against Yeovil Town in the third round of the FA Cup.[66] A week later, he was used as a forward by manager Louis van Gaal in a 0\u20131 home defeat to Southampton.[67] This new role came in the midst of a bad run of form for Di Mar\u00eda, who was said to have struggled since October.[68] Di Mar\u00eda was sent off on 9 March as United lost 1\u20132 at home against Arsenal in the FA Cup sixth round, being booked for diving and for grabbing the shirt of referee Michael Oliver, but earlier set up the equaliser by Wayne Rooney.[69][70]\nAt the season's end, Di Mar\u00eda was judged by The Daily Telegraph to be the worst signing of the season.[71]\nOn 25 July 2015, Di Mar\u00eda failed to board a flight to the United States to join Manchester United's pre-season tour as scheduled; manager Louis van Gaal said he \"did not know why\".[72] On 2 August, it was reported Di Mar\u00eda would undergo a medical ahead of a move to Paris Saint-Germain;[73] and four days later, Manchester United confirmed he had been sold to the French champions for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around \u00a344 million, signing a four-year contract.[74][75][76][77]\nIn the 2016\u201317 Champions League group stage home match against Basel on 19 October 2016, Di Mar\u00eda scored the opening goal in the 40th minute in a 3\u20130 victory for PSG to register his first goal of the season.[83] On 19 November, he opened the scoring with his first Ligue 1 goal of the season in a 2\u20130 home win against Nantes.\nOn the first leg of his side's Champions league round of 16 tie against his former club Manchester United in the 2018\u201319 season, Di Mar\u00eda sustained a serious injury following a tackle from Ashley Young; however, he refused to be substituted, and in the final moments of the game, he assisted Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's goal for a 0\u20132 win at Old Trafford.[87] Eventually, PSG lost 3\u20131 in the second leg and were eliminated in the round of 16 for the third consecutive season.[88]\nIn the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League group stage, Di Mar\u00eda scored a brace in a 3\u20130 win over his former club Real Madrid on 18 September 2019.[89] On 18 August 2020, Di Mar\u00eda scored a goal and recorded two assists in PSG's 3\u20130 Champions League semi-final victory over RB Leipzig;[90] the club went on to play against Bayern Munich in the final, but lost the match 1\u20130.[91]\nOn 23 September 2020, Di Mar\u00eda was handed a four-match suspension for a spitting incident with \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez during Le Classique 10 days earlier.[92] He would miss the league matches against Angers, N\u00eemes, Dijon and Nantes.[93] In a UEFA Champions League match against RB Leipzig on 4 November, Di Mar\u00eda scored the opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 defeat.[94] He made his return to league action in a match against Rennes three days later, and scored a goal to help PSG win the match 3\u20130.[95]\nIn a home match against \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir on 9 December 2020, Di Mar\u00eda recorded two assists; he subsequently became the player with the third most assists in UEFA Champions League history with a tally of 32, only being behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[96] On 12 March 2021, Di Mar\u00eda extended his contract with Paris Saint-Germain for one more season with an option for a second.[97] On 4 May, Di Mar\u00eda was sent off against Manchester City in the semi-finals of the Champions League for stamping on Fernandinho in an off the ball incident.[98] He was handed a three-match ban in European competitions.[99] In the 2021 Coupe de France Final, when PSG defeated Monaco by a score of 2\u20130, Di Mar\u00eda broke the all-time assist record for PSG by delivering a pass for a Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 goal. It was his 104th assist as a PSG player.[100]\nIn the 2021\u201322 season with Paris Saint-Germain, Di Mar\u00eda won the Ligue 1 title, his fifth league title with the club. On 20 May 2022, his departure from Paris at the end of his contract was confirmed.[101] In his last match for the club against Metz on 21 May, Di Mar\u00eda scored a goal and recorded an assist, helping his team to a 5\u20130 win. He received a tribute and ovation from the Parc des Princes.[102] Di Mar\u00eda ended his spell at PSG with 92 goals and 112 assists in 295 matches.[103]\nOn 23 February 2023, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 away win over Nantes in the Europa League.[110] On 9 March, he scored his fourth goal in the competition, after netting the only goal of an home win over Freiburg.[111] He impressed during the season, despite suffering from multiple hamstring injuries, which limited his game time. On 6 June, Di Mar\u00eda confirmed his departure from Juventus, following the expiry of his contract.[112]\nOn 6 July 2023, Di Mar\u00eda signed a one-year contract with Benfica and was presented in front of 2,500 Benfica supporters in the entrance of Est\u00e1dio da Luz.[113][114] On 9 August, Di Mar\u00eda made his second debut at Benfica, scoring the opening goal of a 2\u20130 victory over Porto in the Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira, winning his first trophy back with the club.[115] With two assists and a goal in a 4\u20130 win over Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es on 2 September, he reached five goal contributions in his first four league games, best in the league.[116]\nOn 28 January 2008, Di Mar\u00eda and some of his under-20s teammates were called up for the Argentina Olympic football team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He scored the extra-time game-winning goal on a pass from Lionel Messi in the 105th minute of his team's 2\u20131 quarter-final win over the Netherlands.[118] On 23 August, Di Mar\u00eda scored the game-winner \u2013 a chip over the goalkeeper from the edge of the area \u2013 in the 57th minute of Argentina's 1\u20130 victory against Nigeria to capture their second-straight Olympic gold medal in the final game of the Olympic tournament.[119]\nOn 19 May 2010, Di Mar\u00eda was selected by Argentinian manager Diego Maradona in the 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On 24 May, Di Mar\u00eda scored his debut international goal in a 5\u20130 friendly win over Canada.[121] At the World Cup, he helped Argentina reach the quarter-finals, playing in all five of Argentina's matches and starting four of them.[122]\nDi Mar\u00eda made 12 appearances during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign[120] and was included in the Argentina national team for the tournament finals.[125] In Argentina's round of 16 match against Switzerland, Di Mar\u00eda scored the only goal of the game after 118 minutes, from a Lionel Messi assist.[126] During the quarter-final match against Belgium, Di Mar\u00eda suffered a muscle tear in the thigh and was later taken off the field. It was later announced after the match that Di Mar\u00eda would miss the rest of the tournament due to the injury.[127] He had previously helped to create Gonzalo Higua\u00edn's only goal of the match, which sent Argentina into the semi-finals. Argentina finished the tournament as runners-up to Germany.[128]\nOn 11 July, Di Mar\u00eda was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[129]\nOn 3 September 2014, in a friendly away against world champions Germany, Di Mar\u00eda had a part in all four of Argentina's goals in a 2\u20134 victory, assisting three and scoring one.[130]\nOn 28 May 2015, Di Mar\u00eda was included in Argentina national team for the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica.[131] On 6 June, he was selected to captain the team in the absence of Lionel Messi for a warm-up match against Bolivia, scoring twice in a 5\u20130 win.[132] A week later, in their opening match of the tournament against Paraguay in La Serena, Di Mar\u00eda won a penalty which Messi scored in a 2\u20132 draw.[133] On 30 June, he scored twice and assisted a goal for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, as Argentina defeated Paraguay 6\u20131 to reach the final.[134] He was substituted with a hamstring injury within the first half-hour of the final against hosts Chile, which his team lost in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw.[135]\nIn Argentina's opening match of the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario on 6 June 2016, a rematch of the previous tournament's final against defending champions Chile, Di Mar\u00eda scored the opening goal of the match and later assisted \u00c9ver Banega's goal in a 2\u20131 win. Di Mar\u00eda dedicated the goal to his grandmother, who had recently died.[136] In his nation's second group match, against Panama on 10 June, he assisted Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi's opening goal, but was later forced off due to injury. Argentina won the match 5\u20130.[137] He missed the rest of the tournament due to injury[138] as Argentina reached the Copa Am\u00e9rica final for the second consecutive time, once again losing out to Chile on penalties, following a 0\u20130 draw.[139]\nIn June 2021, Di Mar\u00eda was included in the Argentina national team for the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[143] On 21 June, he assisted the only goal of the match, scored by Papu G\u00f3mez, in Argentina's third group match against Paraguay; the result allowed his side to progress to the quarter-finals.[144] In the final of the tournament against the hosts Brazil on 10 July, he scored the only goal of the match to give Argentina their joint record 15th Copa Am\u00e9rica title with Uruguay and their first international title since 1993. He ran onto a long pass from Rodrigo De Paul into the Brazilian penalty area. The pass was slightly deflected by Brazilian defender Renan Lodi before Di Mar\u00eda controlled the ball with the outside of his left foot; he then chipped the ball over the goalkeeper Ederson, giving Argentina an early lead. Although he was substituted late in the second half of the match, the goal would hold as the winning effort for Argentina.[145]\nOn 11 November 2022, Di Mar\u00eda was named in the final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[147] On 26 November, he recorded an assist on Messi's opening goal in Argentina's second group match, a 2\u20130 win over Mexico.[148] On 18 December, Di Mar\u00eda scored his team's second goal against France in the final, minutes after winning the penalty for the first goal as Argentina defeated France 4\u20132 on penalties, after the match ended 3\u20133 in extra-time, to win the World Cup.[149] He was surprised by the coach's decision to start him on the left and thought Scaloni was \"confused,\" but Scaloni convinced Di Maria how he wanted to game plan with him specifically on the left.[150]\nDi Mar\u00eda is a quick, strong, tricky and talented winger who is also capable of playing as a more central attacking midfielder or on either side of the pitch, although he is predominantly a left-footed player.[151] He has also been deployed to great effect as a central midfielder, in particular under Carlo Ancelotti's tenure with Real Madrid.[45] Possessing a slender frame,[152] Di Mar\u00eda is an agile, creative and highly technical player who possesses excellent dribbling skills and ball control, as well as great pace, stamina, movement, and acceleration, attributes which allow him to beat players easily in one-on-one situations. He is also gifted with excellent vision, set-piece delivery, passing, and crossing ability, which allow him to function effectively as a playmaker and as an assist provider, although he is also capable of scoring goals himself, and is an accurate free kick taker. Despite not being physically imposing, he is also a very hard-working player, and he improved on the defensive aspect of his game under manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.[153][154][155][156] Considered to be one of the greatest players of his generation and one of the greatest Argentine players of all time,[4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Di Mar\u00eda has also drawn praise in the media over his decisive performances in important matches throughout his career.[157] Despite his ability, however, he has often struggled with injuries throughout his career.[158]\nHe married fellow Argentine Jorgelina (n\u00e9e Cardoso) in 2011.[162] Together they have two daughters, Mia and Pia. Pia was born three months premature and survived after treatment at an intensive care unit at the Hospital Universitario Montepr\u00edncipe in Madrid.[162][163]\nOn 2 September 2020, it was reported that Di Mar\u00eda, along with PSG teammates Neymar and Leandro Paredes, had tested positive for COVID-19. The French sports newspaper L'\u00c9quipe said that the three players reportedly went on vacation in Ibiza. As a result, they had to quarantine for one week, and the rest of the players and working staff were scheduled to take a coronavirus test within the same week.[165][166]\nDuring a match between PSG and Nantes on 14 March 2021, Di Mar\u00eda's home was robbed and his family was held hostage. He had been substituted off the pitch by manager Mauricio Pochettino, who informed Di Mar\u00eda of the situation. PSG teammate Marquinhos' parents' home was also burgled in a similar way.[167]\nDi Mar\u00eda is one of the 13 sports personalities named in the Pandora Papers published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). He used a company in Panama to exploit his image rights for months before arriving at Real Madrid. He is the owner of a company in Panama created especially to manage his million-dollar contracts for the exploitation of his image rights, a shell company that he used since 2009 and that he maintains to this day while playing at Paris Saint-Germain with Lionel Messi. The Pandora Papers reveal that he handled more than 8 million euros between 2013 and 2017 through a company named Sunpex Corporation Inc.[168]",

The biblical name for this holiday is Yom Teruah (\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4\u200e, Y\u014dm T\u0259r\u016b\u02bf\u0101, lit. \"day of shouting/blasting\"). It is the first of the JewishHigh Holy Days (\u05d9\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, Y\u0101m\u012bm N\u014dr\u0101\u02be\u012bm, \"Days of Awe\"), as specified by Leviticus 23:23\u201325,[1] that occur in the late summer/early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere. Rosh Hashanah begins a ten-day period of penitence culminating in Yom Kippur, as well as beginning the cycle of autumnal religious festivals running through Sukkot and ending in Shemini Atzeret in Israel and in Simchat Torah everywhere else.\nRosh Hashanah is a two-day observance and celebration that begins on the first day of Tishrei, which is the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year. In contrast to the ecclesiastical lunar new year on the first day of the first month Nisan, the spring Passover month which marks Israel's exodus from Egypt, Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the civil year, according to the teachings of Judaism, and is the traditional anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman according to the Hebrew Bible, as well as the initiation of humanity's role in God's world.\nRosh Hashanah customs include sounding the shofar (a hollowed-out ram's horn), as prescribed in the Torah, following the prescription of the Hebrew Bible to \"raise a noise\" on Yom Teruah. Its rabbinical customs include attending synagogue services and reciting special liturgy about teshuva, as well as enjoying festive meals. Eating symbolic foods, such as apples dipped in honey, hoping to evoke a sweet new year, is an ancient tradition recorded in the Talmud.[2]\nRosh is the Hebrew word for \"head\", ha is the definite article (\"the\"), and shana means year. Thus Rosh HaShanah means \"head of the year\", referring to the Jewish day of new year.[3][4]\nThe term Rosh Hashanah in its current meaning does not appear in the Torah. Leviticus 23:24[5] refers to the festival of the first day of the seventh month as zikhron teru'ah (\"a memorial of blowing [of horns]\") Numbers 29:1[6] calls the festival yom teru'ah (\"day of blowing [the horn]\").\nThe term rosh hashanah appears once in the Bible (Ezekiel 40:1),[7] where it has a different meaning: either generally the time of the \"beginning of the year\", or possibly a reference to Yom Kippur,[8] or to the month of Nisan.[a][12]\nThe origin of the Hebrew New Year is connected to the beginning of the economic year in the agricultural societies of the ancient Near East.[13] The New Year was the beginning of the cycle of sowing, growth, and harvest; the harvest was marked by its own set of major agricultural festivals.[13] The Semites generally set the beginning of the new year in autumn, while other ancient civilizations chose spring for that purpose, such as the Persians or Greeks; the primary reason was agricultural in both cases, the time of sowing the seed and bringing in the harvest.[13]\nSome scholars posit a connection between the Babylonian festival Akitu and Rosh Hashanah, as there are some striking similarities. The Akitu festival of Ur was celebrated in the beginning of Nisanu (first month), which lasted at least five days, and again in Tashritu, the seventh month, which lasted eleven days.[14] Akitu was also strongly tied to the creation myth of Enuma Elish and the victory of Marduk over the sea monster Tiamat, and the creation of the universe from her corpse. Similarly it is said that the world was created on Rosh Hashanah.[15]\nRosh Hashanah marks the start of the numbering of a new year in the Hebrew calendar. In Jewish law, four different \u2033New Years\u2033 are observed: Rosh Hashanah (the first of Tishrei), the first of Nisan (when the Exodus began), the first of Elul, and Tu BiShvat (the fifteenth of Shevat). Each one delineates the beginning of a \"year\" for different legal or ecclesiastical purposes. The Talmudic distinctions among the \"New Years\" are discussed in the tractate on Rosh Hashanah.[4] Rosh Hashanah is the new year for calculating ordinary calendar years, Sabbatical years, Jubilee years, and dates inscribed on legal deeds and contracts. Rosh Hashanah commemorates the creation of Man.[16] In Jewish practice, the months are numbered starting with the spring month of Nisan, making Tishrei the seventh month; Rosh Hashanah, the first day of the new calendar year, is also actually the first day of the seventh month.[17]\nThe second of these \"New Years\", the first of the lunar month Nisan (usually corresponds to the months March\u2013April in the Gregorian calendar) is the beginning of the ecclesiastical year; the months are numbered beginning with Nisan. It marks the start of the year for the three Jewish pilgrimages.[18] Its injunction is expressly stated in the Hebrew Bible: \"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months\" (Exodus 12:2).[19] Their injunction is expressly stated in the Hebrew Bible: \"Three times in the year you shall keep a feast unto me... the feast of unleavened bread (Passover)... the feast of harvest (Shavuot)... and the feast of ingathering (Sukkot) which is at the departing of the year\" (Exodus 23:14\u201316).[20] \"At the departing of the year\" implies that the new year begins here.[21] It is also when a new year is added to the reign of Jewish kings.\nThe third \"New Year,\" the first of Elul, the new year for animals, began the religious taxation period for tithing animals in Biblical times. Elul corresponds to the Gregorian August/September, after the spring birthings, when it was relatively simple to count the number of animals in herds.\nThe fourth \"New Year,\" Tu Bishvat, the new year for trees, began the religious taxation period for tithing fruits and nuts from trees. Shevat corresponds to the Gregorian January/February, the end of the Mediterranean wet season when the majority of the year's rainfall had occurred. Taking fruit or nuts from a tree younger than three years old, with the birthday counted as Tu Bishvat, was prohibited.\nThe Mishnah contains the second known reference to Rosh Hashanah as the \"day of judgment\" (Yom haDin).[22] In the Talmud tractate on Rosh Hashanah, it states that three books of account are opened on Rosh Hashanah, wherein the fate of the wicked, the righteous, and those of the intermediate class are recorded. The names of the righteous are immediately inscribed in the Book of Life and they are sealed \"to live\". The intermediate class is allowed a respite of ten days, until Yom Kippur, to reflect, repent, and become righteous;[23] the wicked are \"blotted out of the book of the living forever.\"[24]\nSome midrashic descriptions depict God as sitting upon a throne, while books containing the deeds of all humanity are opened for review, and each person passes in front of him for evaluation of his or her deeds.[25]\n\"The Holy One said, 'on Rosh Hashanah recite before Me [verses of] Sovereignty, Remembrance, and Shofar blasts (malchuyot, zichronot, shofarot): Sovereignty so that you should make Me your King; Remembrance so that your remembrance should rise up before Me. And through what? Through the Shofar.' (Rosh Hashanah 16a, 34b)\"[26]\nThis is reflected in the prayers composed by classical rabbinic sages for Rosh Hashanah found in traditional machzorim where the theme of the prayers is the \"coronation\" of God as King of the universe, in preparation for the acceptance of judgments that will follow on that day.\nThe best-known ritual of Rosh Hashanah is the blowing of the shofar, a musical instrument made from an animal horn. The shofar is blown at various points during the Rosh Hashanah prayers, and it is customary in most communities to have a total of 100 blasts on each day.[27] The shofar is not blown on Shabbat.[28]\nWhile the blowing of the shofar is a Biblical statute, it is also a symbolic \"wake-up call\", stirring Jews to mend their ways and repent. The shofar blasts call out: \"Sleepers, wake up from your slumber! Examine your ways and repent and remember your Creator.\"[29]\nAdditionally, the act of blowing the shofar, like the rainbow, is ordered by God as a reminder to God of humanity and our plight.[30]\nOn Rosh Hashanah day, religious poems called piyyutim, are added to the regular services. A special prayer book, the machzor (plural machzorim), is used on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.[31] A number of additions are made to the regular service, most notably an extended repetition of the Amidah prayer for both Shacharit and Mussaf. The shofar is blown during Mussaf at several intervals.[32] (In many synagogues, even little children come and hear the shofar being blown.)[further explanation needed] A variety of piyyutim, medieval penitential prayers, are recited regarding themes of repentance. The Aleinu prayer is recited during the silent prayer as well as the repetition of the Mussaf Amidah.[33]\nThe special Avinu Malkeinu prayer is also recited on Rosh Hashanah. In the Ashkenazic rite, Avinu Malkeinu is never recited on Shabbat (except in Ne'ila on Yom Kippur), and it is also omitted at Mincha on Fridays.\nThe narrative in the Book of Genesis describing the announcement of Isaac's birth and his subsequent birth[34] is part of the Torah readings in synagogues on the first day of Rosh Hashanah, and the narrative of the sacrifice and binding of Isaac[35] is read in synagogue on the second day of Rosh Hashanah.\nThe MussafAmidah prayer on Rosh Hashanah is unique in that apart from the first and last three blessings, it contains three central blessings making a total of nine. These blessings are entitled \"Malchuyot\" (Kingship, and also includes the blessing for the holiness of the day as in a normal Mussaf), \"Zichronot\" (Remembrance), and \"Shofarot\" (concerning the shofar). Each section contains an introductory paragraph followed by selections of verses about the \"topic\". The verses are three from the Torah, three from the Ketuvim, three from the Nevi'im, and one more from the Torah. During the repetition of the Amidah, the shofar is sounded (except on Shabbat) after the blessing that ends each section.[36] Recitation of these three blessings is first recorded in the Mishna,[37] though writings by Philo and possibly even Psalms 81[38] suggest that the blessings may have been recited on Rosh Hashanah even centuries earlier.[39]\nIn many Eastern Ashkenazi congregations, a kittel is worn during daytime Rosh Hashanah prayers, just as one is worn on Yom Kippur.\nRosh Hashanah is preceded by the month of Elul, during which Jews are supposed to begin a self-examination and repentance, a process that culminates in the ten days of the Yamim Nora'im, the Days of Awe, beginning with Rosh Hashanah and ending with the holiday of Yom Kippur.[40][41]\nThe shofar is traditionally blown on weekday mornings, and in some communities also in the afternoon, for the entire month of Elul, the month preceding Rosh Hashanah. The sound of the shofar is intended to awaken the listeners from their \"slumbers\" and alert them to the coming judgment.[42][40]\nThe shofar is not blown on Shabbat.[28]\nIn the period leading up to Rosh Hashanah, penitential prayers called selichot, are recited. The Sephardic tradition is to start at the beginning of Elul, while the Ashkenazic and Italian practice is to start a few days before Rosh Hashanah.[40]\nThe day before Rosh Hashanah day is known as Erev Rosh Hashanah (\"Rosh Hashanah eve\").[43] It is the 29th day of the Hebrew month of Elul, ending at sundown, when Rosh Hashanah commences. Some communities perform Hatarat nedarim (a nullification of vows) after the morning prayer services.[44] Many Orthodox men immerse in a mikveh in honor of the coming day.[45]\nRosh Hashanah meals usually include apples dipped in honey to symbolize a sweet new year;[46] this is a late medieval Ashkenazi addition. Other foods with a symbolic meaning may be served, depending on local minhag (\"custom\"), such as the head of a fish (to symbolize the prayer \"let us be the head and not the tail\").[47]\nMany communities hold a \"Rosh Hashanah seder\" during which blessings are recited over a variety of symbolic dishes.[48][49] The blessings have the incipit \"Yehi ratzon\", meaning \"May it be Thy will.\" In many cases, the name of the food in Hebrew or Aramaic represents a play on words (a pun). The Yehi Ratzon platter may include apples (dipped in honey, baked or cooked as a compote called mansanada); dates; pomegranates; black-eyed peas; pumpkin-filled pastries called rodanchas; leek fritters called keftedes de prasa; beets; and a whole fish with the head intact. It is also common among Sephardim to eat stuffed vegetables called legumbres yaprakes.[50]\nSome of the symbolic foods eaten are dates, black-eyed peas, leeks, spinach, and gourd, all of which are mentioned in the Talmud:[51] \"Let a man be accustomed to eat on New Year's Day gourds (\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0), and fenugreek (\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0),[52] leeks (\u05db\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9), beet [leaves] (\u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05e7\u05d0), and dates (\u05ea\u05de\u05e8\u05d9).\"\nCarrots can have multiple symbolic meanings at the Rosh Hashanah table. The Yiddish word for carrot is ma\u2019rin (\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05df), which also means \u201cincrease.\u201d By eating carrots one asks for their merits and blessings to be increased. Sliced carrots are also typically eaten to symbolize gold coins and hopes for continued wealth and prosperity. In Hebrew the word for carrot is gezer (\u05d2\u05d6\u05e8) which sounds similar to the word g\u2019zar - the Hebrew word for \u201cdecree.\u201d Serving carrots on Rosh Hashanah symbolizes a desire to have God nullify any negative decrees against us.[53]\nPomegranates are used in many traditions, to symbolize being fruitful like the pomegranate with its many seeds.[54] Typically, round challah bread is served, to symbolize the cycle of the year.[54][46] From ancient to quite modern age, lamb head or fish head were served. Nowadays, lekach (honey cake) and gefilte fish are commonly served by Ashkenazic Jews on this holiday. On the second night, new fruits are served to warrant the inclusion of the shehecheyanu blessing.[47]\nThe general Ashkenazic custom is to eat sweet foods, such as honey cake and teiglach, to auger a sweet year. The Sephardic and Mizrahi custom is frequently to eat light-coloured foods, or rather, to avoid dark ones, so as to avoid a dark year.[citation needed]\nThe ritual of tashlikh is performed on the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah by most Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews (but not by Spanish and Portuguese Jews or some Yemenites, as well as those who follow the practices of the Vilna Gaon). Prayers are recited near natural flowing water, and one's sins are symbolically cast into the water. Many also have the custom to throw bread or pebbles into the water, to symbolize the \"casting off\" of sins. In some communities, if the first day of Rosh Hashanah occurs on Shabbat, tashlikh is postponed until the second day. The traditional service for tashlikh is recited individually and includes the prayer \"Who is like unto you, O God... And You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea\", and Biblical passages including Isaiah 11:9 (\"They will not injure nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be as full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea\") and Psalms118:5\u20139, Psalms 121 and Psalms 130, as well as personal prayers. Though once considered a solemn individual tradition, it has become an increasingly social ceremony practiced in groups. Tashlikh can be performed any time until Hoshana Rabba, and some Hasidic communities perform Tashlikh on the day before Yom Kippur.[55]\nThe Hebrew common greeting on Rosh Hashanah is Shanah Tovah (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4; pronounced[\u02c8\u0283ona\u02c8t\u0254\u0361\u026ava] in many Ashkenazic communities and pronounced[\u0283a\u02c8nato\u02c8va] in Israeli and Sephardic communities), which translated from Hebrew means \"[have a] good year\".[56] Often Shanah Tovah Umetukah (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d5\u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05e7\u05d4\u200e), meaning \"[have a] Good and Sweet Year\", is used.[57] In Yiddish the greeting is \u05d0\u05b7 \u05d2\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d9\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8 \"a gut yor\" (\"a good year\") or \u05d0\u05b7 \u05d2\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d2\u05e2\u05d1\u05e2\u05e0\u05d8\u05e9\u05d8 \u05d9\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8 \"a gut gebentsht yor\" (\"a good blessed year\").[56] The formal Sephardic greeting is Tizku Leshanim Rabbot (\"may you merit many years\"),[58] to which the answer is Ne'imot VeTovot (\"pleasant and good ones\"); while in Ladino, they say \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05d0\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4, \u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05e1\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9 \"anyada buena, dulse i alegre\" (\"may you have a good, sweet and happy New Year\").[citation needed]\nA more formal greeting commonly used among religiously observant Jews is Ketivah VaChatimah Tovah (Hebrew: \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4\u200e), which translates as \"A good inscription and sealing [in the Book of Life]\",[56] or L'shanah tovah tikatevu v'techatemu meaning \"May you be inscribed and sealed for a good year\".[57] After Rosh Hashanah ends, the greeting is changed to G'mar chatimah tovah (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05de\u05e8 \u05d7\u05ea\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4\u200e) meaning \"A good final sealing\", until Yom Kippur.[56] After Yom Kippur is over, until Hoshana Rabbah, as Sukkot ends, the greeting is Gmar Tov (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05b0\u05bc\u05de\u05b8\u05e8 \u05d8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u200e), \"a good conclusion\".[59]\nUnlike the denominations of Rabbinical Judaism, Karaite Judaism believes the Jewish New Year starts with the first month and celebrates this holiday only as it is mentioned in the Torah, that is as a day of rejoicing and shouting.[60] Karaites allow no work on the day except what is needed to prepare food (Leviticus 23:23, 24).[61]\nThe Torah defines Rosh Hashanah as a one-day celebration, and since days in the Hebrew calendar begin at sundown, the beginning of Rosh Hashanah is at sundown at the end of 29 Elul. Since the time of the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE and the time of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, normative Jewish law appears to be that Rosh Hashanah is to be celebrated for two days, because of the difficulty of determining the date of the new moon.[8] Nonetheless, there is some evidence that Rosh Hashanah was celebrated on a single day in Israel as late as the thirteenth century CE.[63]\nOrthodox and Conservative Judaism now generally observe Rosh Hashanah for the first two days of Tishrei, even in Israel where all other Jewish holidays dated from the new moon last only one day. The two days of Rosh Hashanah are said to constitute \"Yoma Arichtah\" (Aramaic: \"one long day\"). In Reform Judaism, while most congregations in North America observe only the first day of Rosh Hashanah, some follow the traditional two-day observance as a sign of solidarity with other Jews worldwide.[64]Karaite Jews, who do not recognize Rabbinic Jewish oral law and rely on their own understanding of the Torah, observe only one day on the first of Tishrei, since the second day is not mentioned in the Written Torah.[65]\nOriginally, the date of Rosh Hashanah was determined based on observation of the new moon (\"molad\"), and thus could fall on any day of the week. However, around the third century CE, the Hebrew calendar was fixed, such that the first day of Rosh Hashanah never falls out on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday.[66][67]\nRosh Hashanah occurs 163 days after the first day of Passover, and thus is usually (but not always) determined by the new moon closest to the autumnal equinox.\nIn terms of the Gregorian calendar, the earliest date on which Rosh Hashanah can fall is 5 September, as happened in 1842, 1861, 1899, and 2013. The latest Gregorian date that Rosh Hashanah can occur is 5 October, as happened in 1815, 1929, and 1967, and will happen again in 2043. After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Rosh Hashanah falling no earlier than 6 September. Starting in 2214, the new latest date will be 6 October.[68]\nIn 2020 the Jewish President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced that Ukraine would declare Rosh Hashanah a national holiday.[69] This makes Ukraine the only country besides Israel where the day is a national holiday.[citation needed]\n^Exodus 12:2[9] refers to the month of Aviv (later renamed Nisan) as \"the first month of the year\", and in Ezekiel 45:18,[10] \"the first month\" unambiguously refers to Nisan, the month of Passover, as made plain by Ezekiel 45:21.[11]\n^Mulder, Otto (2003).

In the United Kingdom, for example, Tuesday, the 24th of March, 1750, was immediately followed by Wednesday, the 25th of March, 1751.

However, Rabbi Hai Gaon, in one of his responsum in \"Otzar Ha-Geonim\", seems to suggest that \"rubia\" (Heb. \u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0) means cowpeas, or what others call, \"black-eyed peas\" (\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9). Rabbi Hai Gaon's disciple, Rabbi Nissim ben Jacob (in his Commentary known as Ketav Hamafteah), thus explains the word \u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0, in our case spelled \u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0, as meaning non-other than cowpeas (\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9), describing them as having a \"dark eye in its center\". Jews of North-Africa traditionally make use of stringed beans in place of rubia.\n^A popular mnemonic is \"lo adu rosh\" (\"Rosh [Hashanah] is not on adu\"), where adu has the numerical value 1-4-6 (corresponding to the numbering of days in the Jewish week, in which Saturday night and Sunday daytime make up the first day).",

The hard part isn't the programming, but the mathematics underneath it.\"[1]\nStudents in each country are selected for their country's team through national computing contests. Students at the IOI compete on an individual basis. There is no official team ranking.\nThe IOI is one of the most prestigious computer science competitions in the world. UNESCO and IFIP are patrons.\nOn each of the two competition days, the students are typically given three problems which they have to solve in five hours. Each student works on his/her own, with only a computer and no other help allowed, specifically no communication with other contestants, books etc. Usually to solve a task the contestant has to write a computer program (only in C++) and submit it before the five-hour competition time ends. The program is graded by being run with secret test data. From IOI 2010, tasks are divided into subtasks with graduated difficulty, and points are awarded only when all tests for a particular subtask yield correct results, within specific time and memory limits. In some cases, the contestant's program has to interact with a secret computer library, which allows problems where the input is not fixed, but depends on the program's actions \u2013 for example in game problems. Another type of problem has known inputs which are publicly available already during the five hours of the contest. For these, the contestants have to submit an output file instead of a program, and it is up to them whether they obtain the output files by writing a program (possibly exploiting special characteristics of the input), or by hand, or by a combination of these means. Pascal has been removed as an available programming language as of 2019.[2]:11\nIOI 2010 for the first time had a live web scoreboard with real-time provisional results. Submissions will be scored as soon as possible during the contest, and the results posted. Contestants will be aware of their scores, but not others', and may resubmit to improve their scores. Starting from 2012, IOI has been using the Contest Management System (CMS) for developing and monitoring the contest.\nThe scores from the two competition days and all problems are summed up separately for each contestant. At the awarding ceremony, contestants are awarded medals depending on their relative total score. The top 50% of the contestants are awarded medals, such that the relative number of gold : silver : bronze : no medal is approximately 1:2:3:6 (thus 1/12 of the contestants get a gold medal).\nPrior to IOI 2010, students who did not receive medals did not have their scores published, making it impossible for a country to be ranked by adding together scores of its competitors unless each wins a medal. From IOI 2010, although the scores of students who did not receive medals are still not available in the official results, they are known from the live web scoreboard. In IOI 2012 the top 3 nations ranked by aggregate score (Russia, China and USA) were subsequently awarded during the closing ceremony.\nAnalysis of female performance shows 77.9% of women obtain no medal, while 49.2% of men obtain no medal. \"The average female participation was 4.4% in 1989\u20131994 and 2.2% in 1996\u20132014.\" It also suggests much higher participation of women on the national level, claiming sometimes double-digit percentages in total participation on the first stage.[3] President of the IOI, Richard Forster, says the competition has difficulty attracting women and that in spite of trying to solve it, \"none of us have hit on quite what the problem is, let alone the solution.\"[1]\nIn IOI 2017 held in Iran, due to not being able to participate in Iran, the Israeli students participated in an offsite competition organized by IOI in Russia.[2]:11 Due to visa issues, the full USA team was unable to attend, although one contestant Zhezheng Luo[4] was able to attend by traveling with the Chinese team[5] and winning gold medal and 3rd place in standings.[6]\nIn IOI 2019 held in Azerbaijan, the Armenia team did not participate due to the dispute between the two countries, despite the guarantees provided[7] and official invitation letter sent by the host Azerbaijan.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, both the IOI 2020 and IOI 2021, originally scheduled to be hosted by Singapore, were held as online contests. The IOI 2022, hosted by Indonesia, was held as a hybrid event, with around 25% of the contestants participating online.[8]\nThe following is a list of the top performers in the history of the IOI.[64] The P sign indicates a perfect score, a rare achievement in IOI history. The U sign indicates an unofficial participation, where a contestant participated in a host's second team. Also, first (I), second (II) and third (III) places among gold medalists are indicated where appropriate. This list includes only those countries where the national selection contest allows the same participant to go multiple times to the IOI.\n^Sim\u00f5es, Gabriel (31 July 2017). \"IOI 2017, first round - Codeforces\".

        "context": "\nAmerica's Got Talent (often abbreviated as AGT) is a televised American talent show competition, and is part of the global Got Talent franchise created by Simon Cowell. The program is produced by Fremantle USA (as well as distributed by) and Syco Entertainment, and broadcasts on the NBCtelevision network. It premiered on June 21, 2006, after plans for a British edition in 2005 were suspended, following a dispute within the British broadcaster ITV. Production would later resume in 2007,[3] following the success of the first season. Each season is mainly run during the network's summer schedule, and has featured various hosts over the course of the program's history. The current host is Terry Crews.\nThe program attracts a variety of participants from across the United States and abroad, who possess some form of talents. Acts range from singing, dancing, comedy, magic, stunts, variety and other genres. Each participant or act who auditions, attempts to secure a place in the live episodes of a season, by impressing a panel of judges. The current line-up consists of Cowell,[4]Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, and Sof\u00eda Vergara. Participants making it into the live episodes, compete against each other for both the judges' and public's vote, in order to reach the live final. The winner receives a large cash prize (primarily paid over a period of time), and since the third season, a chance to headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip.\nThe show itself has been a rating success for NBC, drawing in on average around 10 million viewers per season. In 2013, a book titled Inside AGT: The Untold Stories of America's Got Talent was released, providing a description of the seasons, contestants, judges and production techniques of the show. It includes detailed interviews with contestants from all seasons, up to the date of the book's publication.[5]\nThe series has run for a total of eighteen seasons, with the eighteenth season airing May\u2013September 2023, and has spawned four spin-off competitions: America's Got Talent: The Champions, which premiered in January 2019, AGT: Extreme, which premiered in February 2022, America's Got Talent: All-Stars, which premiered in January 2023, and AGT: Fantasy League, which will premiere in 2024. The main series is set to return for season nineteen in summer 2024 with host Crews and judges Cowell, Mandel, Klum, and Vergara all expected to return.\nSimon Cowell, creator of America's Got Talent and the Got Talent franchise, is primarily a judge on the British international version of the franchise. He has operated as a judge on AGT since May 2016.\nThe concept of America's Got Talent was devised by The X Factor creator and Sony Music executive Simon Cowell, who sought to create a talent competition far grander than those of other televised talent contests. His proposal, first made to British television network ITV in 2005, was for a competition in which participants of any age and location could enter with any form of talent they chose to perform. The network favored the concept, and green-lit production of a pilot episode to test out the format, with Cowell forming a panel consisting of himself and two other judges (including tabloid journalist Piers Morgan).[6] The pilot proved to be a success. The original plan for the program was for a British edition to be produced and broadcast between 2005 and 2006, hosted by British television personality Paul O'Grady, who had assisted with the pilot[7] (before Cowell would propose the format for American television). However, O'Grady became involved in a dispute with ITV during work on the new program, ultimately terminating his contract with them and defecting to another British network.[8]\nAs a result, Cowell suspended work on the British edition, and hastened his efforts on launching the format in America. Approaching several networks, Cowell received an offer from NBC to produce his televised competition for their network, owing to feedback given to the pilot made for ITV, and agreed to a contract to produce fifteen episodes for the 2006 summer schedule. Cowell worked with Fremantle and his company Syco Entertainment, but decided against becoming a judge for the new program, choosing to act as executive producer instead. Regis Philbin served as the host,[9] with David Hasselhoff, Brandy Norwood and Morgan as judges.[10] The first season proved a success, leading NBC to commission additional seasons, and prompting ITV to contact Cowell with the intention of resuming production on the British edition for 2007. The success of Britain's Got Talent (along with the American series), led Cowell to accept offers for the rights to the competition format, creating the Got Talent franchise.\nEach year's competition begins with a set of audition stages, the first being the \"Producers' Auditions\", is conducted across various cities in the United States.[11] This stage is open to all forms of acts and judged by an independent group, and thus determines who will take part in the next stage of auditions titled \"Judges' Auditions\". These are held in a public venue, within select cities across the country, and are attended by the judges handling that year's contest.\nEach participant reaching this stage of auditions is held offstage from the main performing area in a waiting room, and given a number that denotes when they will perform. Upon being called before the judges, the participant is given 90 seconds to demonstrate their act, with a live audience present for all performances. Each judge is given a buzzer, and may use it during a performance if they are unimpressed, dislike what is being performed, or feel the act is a waste of their time. If a participant is buzzed by all judges, their performance is automatically over. At the end of a performance, the judges give constructive criticism and feedback about what they saw, whereupon they are each given a vote. A participant requires a majority vote approving their performance to proceed to the next stage, otherwise they are eliminated from the program at that stage. Many acts that move on may be cut or forfeit their place, due to the limited slots available for the next stage. Filming for each season begins when the Judges' Auditions are taking place, with the show's presenter standing in the wings of each venue's stage to interview, and give personal commentary on a participant's performance.\nFrom the fifth to seventh seasons, acts who did not attend live auditions could instead submit a taped audition online via YouTube. Acts from the online auditions were then selected to compete in front of the judges and a live audience during the \"live shows\" part of the season, prior to the semi-finals. Before the inclusion of this round, the show had a separate audition episode in Seasons 3 and 4 (2008\u20132009) for contestants who posted videos on MySpace.[12]\nIn the ninth season, the show added a new format to the auditions in the form of the \"Golden Buzzer\", which began to make appearances within the Got Talent franchise, since it was first introduced on Germany's Got Talent. During auditions, each judge is allowed to use the Golden Buzzer to send an act automatically into the live shows, regardless of the opinion of the other judges. When it was initially used, the buzzer simply saved an act from elimination. The only rule to the buzzer was that a judge could use it only once per season. The host was later allowed to use the Golden Buzzer for an act starting from the eleventh season.\nAfter auditions are completed, the judges conduct a special session (or second \"audition\" round) to determine which participants will secure a place in the live rounds of the competition, though the format for this stage has been change several times over the course of the program's history. When the stage was first created after the first season, it was designed around a \"boot camp\" format titled \"Las Vegas Callbacks\". Under the format's rules, participants who made it through the preliminary auditions could undergo training to perfect their act, whereupon each would be assigned to a specific group of participants and perform a second time before the judges. Buzzers would be used to terminate a performance at any time, with those not deemed worthy of a place being eliminated from that season's format.\nBetween the fourth and ninth season, the format was changed to match that used in Britain's Got Talent. Participants who made it through the preliminary auditions had their audition footage reviewed by the judges, who set each one into a specific group, and were not required to perform again (unless the judges requested this). Acts which they liked would be allocated spaces in the live rounds, with the remainder eliminated from that season's competition. All acts were brought back to learn of the results of the judges' deliberations. The format was titled \"Vegas Verdicts\" and held on the Las Vegas Strip. For the final seasons of its usage, it was re-dubbed \"Judgment Week\" and conducted within New York.[13]\nBetween the tenth season and fourteenth season, the stage's format was changed again under a new arrangement dubbed \"Judge Cuts\". Under the new format's rules, participants that passed the preliminary auditions underwent a second stage of auditions before the judges at a fixed venue. However, their performance would not only be judged by the panel, but also by a special guest judge, with all participants divided up into four groups. Each group would be judged by their own guest judge. Like the auditions, the main judges could use their buzzers at any time to stop a performance, while the guest judge would be allowed to use a Golden Buzzer for a participant they particularly liked (as well as providing comments on the performances they watched). In the fifteenth season, the round was condensed into a single episode and featured no guest judge, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in 2020. The round was replaced to its current arrangement for the sixteenth season, matching that of Britain's Got Talent around that time.\nParticipants who pass their auditions and secure a place in the live rounds of the competitions, including those who received the Golden Buzzer after the format's introduction and subsequent amendment to match other Got Talent editions, are divided into groups and compete against each other to secure a place within the live final of the competition. Live episodes of the competition are held within a set venue (the location has varied), with the current arrangement focused on a venue within Los Angeles and live episodes for each season being aired weekly on the network. The arrangement differs from the schedule used by other international editions. Britain's Got Talent, for example, broadcasts its live episodes within the space of a single week. The structure of the live rounds by this stage of the competition has varied, but is more commonly arranged as quarter-finals, semi-finals and the final itself. Earlier seasons varied, sometimes having the finals split into separate rounds.\nThe format of the live rounds, for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, sees each participant conduct a new performance of their act before the judges and the viewers within a \"performance\" episode. In this episode, the judges can still give out feedback and comments about a participant's performance, and be able to use their buzzers, with the performance terminated if all the buzzers are used. After the episode is broadcast, the network provides the public a set period of time to vote for their act, with the results of these held in a separate \"results\" episode. When it is broadcast has varied, though it more commonly occurs after an interval of one day after the live \"performance\" episode. Participants wore the same outfits from the performance episode and are then informed of the results, with those receiving the highest votes (i.e. Top 4) advancing to the next stage. For the two acts that receive the mid-range of votes for all participants, they undergo a vote by the judges to determine who joins those who advanced. When the program brought in the format of using four judges, a tie-break on this vote results in the act with the higher number of public votes moving on. The Judges' vote was not a common format element in earlier seasons. In the first season, the judges did not decide on who moved on, instead voting for acts they liked or disliked. In the second season, they could not vote on acts at all, instead only being able to buzz them.\nFor some acts that are eliminated, there is still a chance for advancement by being appointed as that round's \"Wildcard\". Until the tenth season, this format varied in how it would work. In some seasons, the judges could each individually select an act, or more than one, to move on to the next stage or compete within a special Wildcard round. In other seasons, the Wildcard acts were selected from among the auditions and competed in a special round. Since the tenth season, the format is more structured and works in a similar manner to that of the format used by Britain's Got Talent, in that the judges and the public can each chose the acts they want to see move on as a Wildcard act. Although the judges are refrained from choosing a quarter-finalist as a Wildcard act, the public may vote online for an act within each quarter-final and semi-final to move on into the next stage, with this vote aptly named after the sponsor for the show in that respective season.\nThose who make it into the season's final compete against each other to secure the most votes from the public, with the number of finalists varying between seasons. Later seasons allow each finalist more than one performance and sometimes being joined by a celebrity guest, previous winner, or notable participant from a previous season. The winning act that achieves the most votes is crowned the winner and receives a cash prize. Although stipulated as $1 million per the program's advertising, in reality winners can choose to either take it as a lump sum, or as a financial annuity of this amount that is paid out over forty years at around $25,000 per year. Both options are liable to taxation.[14] Since Season 10, the winner will also perform on the first results show of the next season. From 2008, the program also includes an additional prize of headlining a show, except from between 2010 and 2013, where the winning finalist headlined a national tour.[15][16] The show they headline mainly takes place within Las Vegas.[17]\nTerry Crews became the host in 2019, following his involvement in AGT: The Champions in January 2019.\nHowie Mandel is the longest serving judge on America's Got Talent, since joining in June 2010.\nNick Cannon is the longest-serving host of the series, hosting eight seasons between 2009 and 2016.\n^ Cowell was absent from the live shows of season 15 due to an accident that resulted in a back injury. After doctors required him to remain under medical observation, production brought in temporary stand-ins for the first two quarter finals, before settling on airing the remaining live rounds with a judging panel of three.\n^Eric Stonestreet had to stand in for Klum during part of season 15, after she fell ill during the last two audition sessions.\nIn its first season, the judging panel consisted of David Hasselhoff, Brandy Norwood and Piers Morgan, with Regis Philbin as the host. Prior to the start of the second season, Norwood stepped down due to a legal matter she was involved with,[19][20] leading to her being replaced by Sharon Osbourne.[21] Philbin was replaced by Jerry Springer as the show's host.[22] Further changes were made to the judging panel and hosting duties in later seasons: Springer left after the third season, and was replaced by Nick Cannon for the fourth season.[23] Hasselhoff left the show after the fourth season, and was replaced by Howie Mandel for the fifth season.[24] Morgan left after the sixth season, and was replaced by Howard Stern for the seventh season.\nIn August 2012, Osbourne left the program following a dispute with NBC.[25][26] While the network replaced her with former Spice Girls member Mel B in February 2013,[27] the judges panel increased to four. This format change had already occurred in other international versions of the competition, such as on Britain's Got Talent two years prior. In March 2013, supermodel Heidi Klum was announced as the fourth judge for the eighth season.[28] In October 2015, Stern was replaced by Simon Cowell for the eleventh season.[4] After his eighth year hosting America's Got Talent, Cannon announced plans to retire from the show due to comments he made about the network.[29] Despite being under contract to continue his hosting duties, NBC eventually replaced him with Tyra Banks for the twelfth season.\nOn February 11, 2019, NBC announced a change to the program's host and its judging panel following the conclusion of the thirteenth season. Banks decided to move on to other projects, leading to her being replaced by Terry Crews, who was already working with the network as host of America's Got Talent: The Champions. Both Klum and Mel B decided to leave America's Got Talent due to other commitments that year, leading to actress Gabrielle Union and dancer Julianne Hough replacing them, joining Mandel and Cowell on the judging panel.[30] However, both Union and Hough took part in only one season before they were let go by the program on November 22, 2019.[31] On February 27, 2020, it was confirmed that Klum would return for the next season, and announced Sof\u00eda Vergara as the fourth judge.[32] In September 2021, host Crews announced the 'end of an era' following the season sixteen finale of America's Got Talent and the series finale of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, stating that these both marked the end of his deal with NBC.[33] However, Crews continued his hosting duties in the following seasons.\nIn 2015, guest judges were introduced into the program as part of the revamp of the format's boot camp stage. The following lists the guest judges who appeared within the program for the \"Judge Cuts\", per season and in order of their appearance by week:\nThe first season for America's Got Talent was promoted in May 2006, and was eventually aired later that year between June 21 and August 17. While later episodes would pre-record auditions at earlier dates, this season had them conducted across June, at venues within the cities of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Live-round episodes were held within the latter city. Initial advertisements for participants of America's Got Talent implied that the winning act would headline a show in Las Vegas, but this was later dropped in favor of a cash prize of $1 million, due to concerns surrounding the possibility of awarding such a prize to a minor.\nThe first season was hosted by Regis Philbin, with the judging panel consisting of actor David Hasselhoff, singer Brandy Norwood and journalist Piers Morgan. More than 12 million viewers watched the program's premiere episode, a far greater viewing figure than had been achieved by the premiere of American Idol in 2002, becoming one of the most-watched program on U.S. television and the highest-rated among viewers aged 18 to 49 at that time.[34] The first season was won by singer Bianca Ryan, with clogging group All That and musical group The Millers being the runners-up. Neither act were defined in the results in terms of who was placed 2nd, and who was placed in 3rd.\nFollowing the success of the previous season, NBC commissioned the program for additional episodes, but originally intended for the new season to be aired as part of its 2007 winter schedule. However, the network decided against this due to the program potentially being placed in direct competition for viewers with American Idol, and kept America's Got Talent within its 2007 summer schedule.[35] The second season aired between June 5 and August 21, 2007. Prior to filming taking place, Philbin left the program and was replaced as host by Jerry Springer.[36] Norwood dropped out, due to a legal situation, and was replaced by Sharon Osbourne. Auditions for this season involved venues within the same cities as had been previously used, but with the inclusion of Dallas as part of its competition schedule.\nThe second season saw the introduction of a new round in the audition process, which was referred to as the \"boot camp stage\", a period of callback episodes filmed in Las Vegas, aimed at streamlining successful participants from the first round of auditions towards a set number for the live rounds. Alongside this, participants in the live rounds moved on via the public vote only, while the episode for results was aired a week after each live episode's performance and within a smaller time slot for its broadcast. This season was won by singing impressionist and ventriloquistTerry Fator, with singer and guitarist Cas Haley coming in second, and singer Butterscotch placing third.\nThe third season aired between June 17 and October 1, 2008, with a break in its broadcast between August 7 and 26 to avoid conflict with NBC's live broadcasts of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Auditions took place much earlier in the production schedule to provide time for finalizing editing on recorded footage, taking place between January and April across venues within the same cities from the previous season, but with the addition of a venue within the city of Atlanta. Unlike the previous season, the Las Vegas callback episodes doubled the number of semi-finalists involved in the live rounds.\nFollowing the second season, judges voted between the participants placed 5th and 6th in the public vote during the quarterfinals and semi-finals, to determine who moved on at each stage. Apart from some amendments to the program's format, staff also implemented cosmetic changes to the set pieces used on America's Got Talent. An example of this included the \"red X's\", used to symbolize disapproval from each judge, being redesigned to match the visual style of those used in Britain's Got Talent. This season was won by opera singer Neal E. Boyd, with singer and pianist Eli Mattson coming in second, and violinists Nuttin' But Stringz placing third.\nThe fourth season aired between June 23 and September 19, 2009, and was the first season to be broadcast in high definition. Auditions were held between January and April, at venues within New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. Additional auditions were held within Washington, D.C., Miami, Tacoma, Boston and Houston. Along with conducting live auditions, participants could also audition by uploading a video of their performance directly to the program's website. Prior to filming taking place, Springer departed from the program following the previous season, and was replaced by Nick Cannon as host.[37]\nFor the fourth year of the competition, the prize for winning was amended so that the winner not only received a cash prize, but would be given their own 0-week headline show at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Apart from the change in the prize, the Results episodes after each performance episode were returned to their original broadcast format. This season was won by country music singer Kevin Skinner, with opera singer B\u00e1rbara Padilla coming in second,[38] and percussionists Recycled Percussion placing third.\nThe fifth season was originally intended to be aired as part of NBC's 2009 Fall schedule, much as had been intended with the second season.[39] However, the network disliked the idea and made certain the program was part of its 2010 summer schedule, with this season airing between June 1 and September 15, 2010.[40] Audition were held between January and April, at venues within Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, Portland (Oregon), Atlanta and Philadelphia. Prior to filming taking place, Hasselhoff left the show due to other commitments,[41] and his role as judge was taken over by comedian Howie Mandel.[42]\nOnline auditions for the program were modified to allow registration via YouTube, with a guaranteed placement in the competition. The live rounds were extended to include two new quarter-finals, each themed to certain groups of participants: those who were chosen from their YouTube auditions and those who had been eliminated during the second round of auditions or their quarter-finals. The final stage of the competition included its finalists conducting performances, each with their own guest performer, a format that would become a part of the program and an optional choice for finalists in future seasons. The finalists were offered a place on the America's Got Talent Live Tour that year, regardless of their final result, although the winner would be made the headline act for the tour in addition to their main prize.[15][16] This season was won by singer/musician Michael Grimm, with classical singer Jackie Evancho coming in second, and performance group Fighting Gravity placing third.\nThe sixth season aired between May 31 and September 14, 2011, with no major changes to the format for this year. Auditions were held between January and April within Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, Houston, Minneapolis, Seattle, Denver and Chicago. Online auditions made via YouTube were conducted on May 4. This season was won by singer Landau Eugene Murphy, Jr., with dance group Silhouettes coming in second, and dance group Team iLuminate placing third.\nThe seventh season aired between May 14 and September 13, 2012, with auditions held between October 2011 and February 2012. These were conducted within the cities of New York, Washington, D.C., Tampa, Charlotte, Austin, Anaheim, St. Louis and San Francisco.[43] Prior to filming taking place, Morgan departed from America's Got Talent after the conclusion of the sixth season (despite signing a three-year contract with the program in July 2010),[44] due to other commitments he had at that time.[45]\nDue to Morgan's departure, his role as judge was taken over by radio personality Howard Stern. However, because of his involvement with hosting his radio show for SiriusXM, the program's production of live episodes were moved to a venue in New York to avoid disrupting his schedule.[46] The graphical presentation of America's Got Talent was revamped, including the title credits, logo and theme music. The change of venue to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, New Jersey not only allowed Cowell to have designers update the studio set, but allowed production staff to invite larger audiences for performances in live episodes than in previous seasons.[47] This season was won by dog tricks act Olate Dogs, with comedian Tom Cotter coming in second, and musician William Close placing third.\nThe eighth season aired between June 4 and September 18, 2013,[48] with auditions held between January and March in a much larger range of venues. Auditions held in the cities of New York, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Antonio were filmed for the new season. Prior to filming commencing, Osbourne left AGT following the seventh season, after a lengthy dispute in August 2012 between herself and NBC.[49][50] While her departure not only led to her role as judge being taken over by Spice Girls member Mel B,[51] the judge panel for future seasons was increased, recruiting supermodel Heidi Klum to join the new season as a fourth judge.[52]\nFor the live episodes of this season, the venue moved from Newark to New York, holding them within Radio City Music Hall. In addition, the format for audition episodes in terms of presentation style, was changed to match that for Britain's Got Talent. In this arrangement, each episode would consist of a number of auditions chosen from those taken from each major venue used for that season.[53] This season was won by martial arts dancer/mime Kenichi Ebina, becoming the first foreign act to win America's Got Talent, with stand-up comedian Taylor Williamson coming in second, and singer/guitarist Jimmy Rose placed third.\nThe ninth season aired between May 27 and September 17, 2014.[54] Preliminary auditions were held between October and December 2013, across several cities including Miami, Atlanta, Houston and Baltimore. The Judge auditions were held between February and April 2014 within Newark, New York and Los Angeles.[55] For this season only, a third-party program was involved in the audition process: one quarter-final place in the competition was offered exclusively by The Today Show via their website, with the top three picked from those that entered competing against each other to be part of America's Got Talent that year.\nSeveral changes were made to the program for this season. The most significant was the introduction of the \"Golden Buzzer\" format, first introduced on Germany's Got Talent in 2012, which had also been introduced into Britain's Got Talent earlier that year. However, it was used mainly to save an act from elimination in the auditions, and wouldn't match the format used across the Got Talent franchise until the following year.[56]\nOther changes included the \"boot camp\" round being filmed in New York, and the introduction of a new online vote for viewers, named after the program's sponsor during that season. This determined which three acts placed in the mid-range of the public vote: 5th, 6th and 7th in the semi-finals, with 4th, 5th and 6th in the \"Top 12\" round advancing, and the remaining two voted by the judges. This season was won by magician Mat Franco, with singer Emily West coming second, and acrobatic troupe AcroArmy placing third.\nThe tenth season aired during 2015, between May 26 and September 16. Producer auditions took place between late 2014 and early 2015 within Tampa, Nashville, Richmond, New York, Chicago, St. Louis, San Antonio, Albuquerque, San Francisco, Seattle, Boise, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.[57] Judge auditions took place during spring until early summer 2015, between March and June within Newark, New York and Los Angeles.[53][58] A special \"extreme\" audition session was held within Pomona, California (performed on an outdoor stage), for participants with acts considered too dangerous to be conducted within an indoor studio set.\nThis season had the Golden Buzzer format, introduced in the previous season, matching that of Britain's Got Talent. Its use would send a participant directly into the live rounds, although the host was not allowed to use it per the revised format.[59] In addition, the boot camp round was revamped with a new format and renamed as \"Judge Cuts\", in which they were held over four weeks rather than one. It consisted of about eighty acts shortlisted from the auditions with around twenty per week, and featured the involvement of a guest judge for each of these episodes. Along with the main judges, they could use the Golden Buzzer for an act they wished to see in the live rounds. Neil Patrick Harris, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Marlon Wayans and Piers Morgan became the first guest judges for the new format in this season.[60][61] The \"Snapple Vote\", introduced in the previous season, was renamed the \"Dunkin' Save\" to coincide with the program's new sponsor. Its format expanded to cover quarter-finalists who finished in 6th, 7th or 8th place per public vote, along with the semi-finalists who finished in 4th, 5th or 6th place per public votes.\nThe eleventh season aired during 2016, between May 31 and September 16.[62] Open auditions were held between late 2015 and early 2016, within Detroit, New York, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, San Jose, San Diego, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Orlando and Dallas.[63] Filming of the judges' auditions took place in March 2016, prior to the premiere episode of the season, and were exclusively conducted within the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles.[64] The season premiered on May 31, 2016.[62] During the previous season on June 24, 2015, Howard Stern announced his departure from America's Got Talent on his TV program,[65] leading to Simon Cowell announcing on October 22 that he would later be replacing him for season eleven.[4] On October 4, 2016, Cowell signed a contract that would keep him as a judge on America's Got Talent until 2019.[66] Stern's departure led to live-round broadcasts moving back to Los Angeles,[67] and filmed at the Dolby Theatre.[68] Apart from this change, the Golden Buzzer format allowed the host (Nick Cannon) to use it during auditions.[69]\nThe twelfth season aired during 2017, between May 30 and September 20.[71] Open auditions were held in late 2016 to early 2017, within Chicago, Austin, Cleveland, Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Diego, New York, Charleston, Memphis and Los Angeles.[72] Filming of the Judges' audition were conducted in March 2017 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles. On February 13, 2017, Nick Cannon resigned from hosting America's Got Talent, following a dispute between himself and NBC concerning remarks he had made during his Showtime comedy special Stand Up, Don't Shoot.[73] As a result, despite Cannon being under contract, the network replaced him with supermodel Tyra Banks.[74]\nThis season is notable for the death of American physician Brandon Rogers (who died in an automobile accident on June 11, 2017), shortly after securing his place on America's Got Talent during the audition's stage. Rogers became involved in the program, following his involvement with American R&B vocal group Boyz II Men earlier that year, after the group had seen footage of him singing on YouTube. In the wake of his death, his audition was postponed before eventually airing during the final audition episode of the season on July 11, as a tribute to his memory.[75]\nThe thirteenth season aired during 2018, between May 29 and September 19.[79][80] Open auditions were held in late 2017 until early 2018, within Orlando, Cincinnati, Savannah, Milwaukee, Houston, Las Vegas, New York, Nashville and Los Angeles.[81] The Judges' auditions were filmed in March 2018 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles.[82] A minor change was made to the format of the Judge Cuts in terms of the number of participants in this stage from the auditions being reduced to seventy-two, with about eighteen performing each week. The guest judges featured in the Judge Cuts for the thirteenth season consisted of Ken Jeong, Olivia Munn, Martina McBride and Chris Hardwick. This season was won by magician Shin Lim, with acrobatic group Zurcaroh coming in second, and violinist Brian King Joseph placing third.\nThe fourteenth season aired during 2019, between May 28 and September 18. Following the previous season, Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum and Mel B, all opted to leave the program. Banks announced her resignation in December 2018,[83] while Klum and Mel B announced their respective departures two months later.[84] Due to this, replacements were sought in February 2019. Terry Crews was appointed as Banks' successor, following his role on the program's spin-off The Champions, while both Julianne Hough and Gabrielle Union were appointed as new judges for the upcoming season.[84] Both auditions and filming began on March 3, 2019.[85][86] On November 22, 2019, it was announced that Hough and Union were let go from the series, marking their only season as judges.[87]\nAlong with the guest judges for the fourteenth season's Judge Cuts were Brad Paisley, Dwyane Wade, Ellie Kemper and Jay Leno.[88] This season is notable for two additional guest judges being added for the live semi-finals: Sean Hayes and Queen Latifah.[89] This season was won by singer and pianist Kodi Lee, with choir group Detroit Youth Choir coming in second, and stand-up comedian Ryan Niemiller placing third.\nThe fifteenth season aired during 2020, between May 26 and September 23. Following the previous season, replacements were made for Union and Hough, after both were let go from the program in November 2019.[31] This resulted in the return of Heidi Klum, along with Sof\u00eda Vergara as a new judge.[32] Although filming had begun by late February with auditions, the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States towards March caused production delays. Live audiences were discontinued, per the advice against large gatherings by health experts. Production was eventually suspended after Klum fell ill during filming, raising concerns about the risk of infection.[90] While production on the live rounds went under discussion, the program confirmed the season would premiere in May with audition episodes, after footage for these was completed and edited for broadcast.[91]\nProduction for the remainder of the season resumed in mid-June, while the season was being broadcast. Several changes were made to minimize the potential for infection among those involved, including participants and judges. While the Judges Cuts round was drastically changed, effectively condensing the stage into a single episode,[92][93] the live rounds featured several measures. These included being filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood, the use of a virtual audience, and an expansion in the number of quarter-finalists.[94][95][96]\nPrior to the first quarter-final, Cowell was seriously injured in an accident and absent from the remainder of the season. Guest judges appeared for two of the quarter-finals, before opting to maintain the use of three judges for the remainder of the episodes.[97] The season was won by spoken word poet Brandon Leake, with country duo Broken Roots coming in second, and singer Cristina Rae placing third.\nA sixteenth season was announced in late February 2021 by NBC, confirming both the host and its judges, including the return of Cowell.[98] Production began after auditions were opened up with participants asked to provide these for judgment, either virtually or via recorded video.[99][100] On March 9, 2021, it was announced that the season would premiere on June 1.[101] This season was won by magician Dustin Tavella, with aerialist Aidan Bryant coming in second, and stand-up comedian Josh Blue placing third.\nThe seventeenth season was announced on March 31, 2022, with the same judging panel and host from the previous two seasons set to return. The season premiered on May 31, 2022.[102][103] This season was won by dance group Mayyas, with pole dancer Kristy Sellars coming in second, and singer and guitarist Drake Milligan placing third.\nThe cast for the eighteenth season was revealed on March 3, 2023, with the same judging panel and host from the previous three seasons announced to be returning.[104] The season premiered on May 30, 2023.[105] This season was won by dog tricks act Adrian Stoica and Hurricane, with magician Anna DeGuzman coming in second, and dance group Murmuration placing third.\nDuring the season eighteen finale on September 27, 2023, it was revealed that the series was officially renewed for a nineteenth season. The season will air in summer 2024 with the full cast from the previous seasons all expected to return.[18]\nIn 2015, America's Got Talent Live discontinued operating as a live tour, instead functioning as a series of shows at the Planet Hollywood Resort in Las Vegas. Performances from the top acts from the tenth season included winner Paul Zerdin, runner-up Drew Lynch, and fan favorite Piff the Magic Dragon. In 2016, four more shows were scheduled at the same venue, and featured performances from the top acts of the eleventh season's final: Grace VanderWaal, The Clairvoyants and Tape Face.[109] In 2017, another four shows were scheduled at the same venue, and featured performances by the top acts of the twelfth season's final: Darci Lynne, Angelica Hale, Light Balance and Preacher Lawson.[110] In 2018, three new shows were scheduled at a new venue in Las Vegas, and featured the top acts from the thirteenth season: Shin Lim, Samuel J. Comroe, Courtney Hadwin, Vicki Barbolak and Duo Transcend.\nIn 2018, NBC commissioned a second special centered on Darci Lynne, the winner of the twelfth season. Titled Darci Lynne: My Hometown Christmas, it was hosted by Farmer, and involved Lonnie Chavis from This Is Us as the special's announcer. It broadcast at the Alex Theatre on December 11, 2018. The special featured a special sketch involving Farmer and that season's judges: Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum and Mel B. A series of duets included Farmer with Lindsey Stirling, Toby Keith and Kristin Chenoweth, respectively. Guest performances were by Pentatonix and Hunter Hayes.\nIn May 2018, NBC commissioned executive producer and Got Talent creator Simon Cowell with producing an all-starspin-off competition, titled America's Got Talent: The Champions. Cowell had conceived of an idea for a global competition consisting of participants that had appeared across the Got Talent franchise across the years, including notable acts and winners. The format for the spin-off would be similar to the main program, though episodes would be pre-recorded when the spin-off contest was held in autumn, and then later broadcast during the network's winter schedule.[114][115][116]\nThe spin-off premiered in January 2019, and as of February 2020, has aired two seasons. AGT season 13 winner Shin Lim,[117] and AGT season 14 finalists V.Unbeatable, won their respective season's contest.\nOn May 14, 2021, NBC announced its second spin-off of the main AGT show, with a focus on daredevil acts. Got Talent creator Cowell serves as an executive producer and judge for the series.[118] Originally planned for a mid-season summer 2021 debut,[119] filming for the series occurred at the Atlanta Motor Speedway between September 27 and October 20, 2021,[120][121] and wrapped in early January 2022.[122]\nOn October 7, 2022, NBC announced its third spin-off of the main AGT show. Similar to America's Got Talent: The Champions, America's Got Talent: All-Stars features winners, finalists, fan favorites, and others from previous seasons of AGT across the Got Talent franchise, competing for the All-Star title. The series, with judges Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, and Howie Mandel as well as host Terry Crews, began production in October 2022,[125] and premiered on January 2, 2023.[126]\nOn September 21, 2023, the fourth spin-off for the AGT series was announced. AGT: Fantasy League will feature the judges competing in a fantasy sports draft-like competition, mentoring the acts to attempt to get an act from their own team be crowned champion. Mel B, who last appeared in the franchise in the first season of America's Got Talent: The Champions in 2019, will return to judge alongside other returning judges Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, and Howie Mandel, with Terry Crews returning to host as well.[127]\nSince the show began, its ratings have been very high, ranging from 9 million viewers to as many as 16 million viewers (generally averaging around 12 million viewers). The show has also ranked high in the 18\u201349 demographic, usually rating anywhere from as low as 1.6 to as high as 4.6 throughout its run. Audition shows and performance shows rate higher on average than results shows.\nAlthough the show's ratings have been high, the network typically keeps the show's run limited to before the official start of the next television season in the third week of September, with some reductions or expansions depending on Olympic years. Finale ratings are usually lower due to returning programming on other networks.\nThe highest rated season in overall viewers to date is season four (2009). The most-watched episode has been the finale of season five (2010), with 16.41 million viewers. The series premiere and an episode featuring the first part of Las Vegas Week in season six (2011) have each tied for highest rating among adults 18\u201349, both having a 4.6 rating.",

        "context": "\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season is the current hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere. It officially began on June 1, and will end on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic.[1] However, the formation of subtropical or tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the formation of a subtropical storm on January 16, the earliest start of an Atlantic hurricane season since Hurricane Alex in 2016.[2] This system went unnamed operationally, as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) treated it as non-tropical. Despite the presence of an intensifying El Ni\u00f1o, which typically results in less Atlantic hurricane activity, the season has been very active in terms of the number of named storms, due in large part to persistent, very warm sea surface temperatures.[3]\n* June\u2013November only \u2020 Most recent of several such occurrences. (See all)\nIn advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and research groups. More than 25 forecasts were made for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.[29] Among them were forecasts from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Prediction Center, Mexico's Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (SMN), Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), the United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMO), and Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray and their associates at Colorado State University (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. According to NOAA and CSU, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1991 and 2020 contained roughly 14 tropical storms, seven hurricanes, three major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 74\u2013126 units.[30] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h). NOAA typically categorizes a season as above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is sometimes also considered.[5]\nOn December 6, 2022, TSR released the first early prediction for the 2023 Atlantic season, predicting a slightly below average year with 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.[7] Their updated prediction on April 6, 2023, called for a similar number of hurricanes, but reduced the number of named storms and major hurricanes by one.[8] The following day, the University of Arizona (UA) posted their forecast calling for a very active season featuring 19 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 163 units.[9] On April 13, CSU researchers released their prediction calling for 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 100 units.[31] Also on April 13, TWC posted their forecast for 2023, calling for a near average season with 15 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.[11] On April 27, University of Missouri (MU) issued their predictions of 10 named storms, 4 between categories one and two, and 3 major hurricanes.[13] On May 1, University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) released their forecast for 12 to 20 named storms.[14] On May 4, SMN issued its forecast for the Atlantic basin, anticipating 10 to 16 named storms overall, with 3 to 7 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes.[15] On May 25, NOAA announced its forecast, calling for 12 to 17 named storms, 5 to 9 hurricanes, and 1 to 4 major hurricanes, with a 40% chance of a near-normal season and 30% each for an above-average season and a below-average season.[16] One day later, UKMO issued its forecast calling for an extremely active season, with 20 named storms, 11 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 222 units.[17]\nIn general, there was a wide range of conclusions among the groups making pre-season forecasts. With regard to number of hurricanes, projections ranged from 5 by SMN to 11 by UKMO. This reflected an uncertainty on the part of the various organizations about how the expected late-summer El Ni\u00f1o event and near record-warm sea surface temperatures would together impact tropical activity.[29]\nOn June 1, the first official day of the season, CSU issued an updated forecast in which they raised their numbers slightly, now expecting a near-average season with 15 named storms, 7 hurricanes, 3 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 125 units. They observed sea surface temperatures in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic had increased further to almost record-highs, which could offset increased wind shear from the impending El Ni\u00f1o.[19] On June 16, UA updated its seasonal prediction, which indicates a very active hurricane season, with 25 named storms, 12 hurricanes, 6 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 260 units.[20] On July 6, CSU issued an updated forecast increasing their numbers, predicting a very active season; they now expect 18 storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes, with an ACE index of 160 units.[22] The following day, TSR released the first seasonal prediction, predicting a slightly above average year with 17 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes and an ACE index of 125.[23] On July 19, TWC updated their forecast, calling for a very active season with 20 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes, citing that a very warm Atlantic ocean could exert more influence and override the El Ni\u00f1o influence.[24]\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and will end on November 30. Nonetheless, it unexpectedly commenced on January 16, when an unnamed subtropical storm formed off the northeastern U.S. coast then moved over Atlantic Canada.[32] Operationally, the NHC considered the storm to be non-tropical, with minimal likelihood of transitioning into a subtropical or tropical cyclone.[33] A post-storm evaluation of the system to determine its proper classification was conducted by a team of forecasters from the NHC and Ocean Prediction Center (OPC). As a result, it was re-designated as subtropical prior to the official start of the season.[32] Tropical Storm Arlene began as a tropical depression on June 1, in the Gulf of Mexico, and became the season's first named storm on June 2. Later that month, when Tropical Storm Bret and Tropical Storm Cindy formed, there were two Atlantic tropical cyclones active simultaneously in June for the first time since 1968.[34] The two developed in the Main Development Region (MDR) from successive tropical waves coming off the coast of West Africa.[35] Their formation also marked the first time on record that two tropical storms have formed in the MDR during the month of June.[36] Next, Subtropical Storm Don formed over the central Atlantic on July 14. A long-lived storm, it later became fully tropical and strengthened into the season's first hurricane as it meandered around the ocean far from land.[37][38]\nThree simultaneous tropical cyclones in the west-central Atlantic on August 29: Idalia (left), Franklin (center), and Tropical Depression Eleven, which would become Jose (far right). The remnants of Gert, which later regenerated, are also visible between Franklin and Eleven.\nFollowing a lull in activity, tropical cyclogenesis picked up drastically in late August. Within a span of 39 hours during August 20\u201322, four tropical storms formed: Emily, Franklin, Gert, and Harold.[39][40] This marked the fastest time four storms were named within the Atlantic basin, surpassing the previous mark of 48 hours, set in 1893 and matched in 1980.[41] Emily formed in the eastern Atlantic, lasting only 24 hours before dissipating. Franklin moved across the Dominican Republic, before intensifying into a Category 4 hurricane in the western Atlantic.[42] Gert became a remnant low on August 22, but regenerated into a tropical cyclone ten days later, on September 1.[43] Tropical Storm Harold affected south Texas and brought much needed rainfall to the region. Those four were followed by two more systems during last week of the month: Idalia, and Jose. Idalia formed on August 26 in the Northwestern Caribbean, intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, then made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida at Category 3 strength. Tropical Storm Jose formed in the open Atlantic on August 31.[44]\nThe quick pace of storm formation continued into September, the climatological peak of the hurricane season. On September 1, Tropical Storm Katia formed northwest of Cabo Verde in the far eastern Atlantic.[43] After Gert and Katia dissipated, Tropical Storm Lee formed in the central tropical Atlantic on September 5.[45] It became a hurricane a day later, and then rapidly intensified to Category 5 strength, with its winds increasing by 85 mph (135 km/h) during the 24\u2011hour period ending at 06:00 UTC on September 8. This made Lee the third\u2011fastest intensifying Atlantic hurricane on record, behind only Felix and Wilma.[46] Lee later made multiple landfalls in Atlantic Canada as an extratropical cyclone. Tropical Storm Margot formed next, and strengthened into the season's fifth hurricane on September 11.[47] They were joined by Tropical Depression Fifteen, later Hurricane Nigel, which formed midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cabo Verde Islands on September 15.[48] Nigel remained far from any land masses, and became extratropical on September 22. That same day, Tropical Storm Ophelia formed offshore of North Carolina.[49] The storm moved inland the following morning at near-hurricane strength.[50] Also on September 23, Tropical Storm Philippe formed in the eastern tropical Atlantic.[51] Right behind Philippe came Tropical Storm Rina five days later. At that time, Philippe and Rina were approximately 620 mi (1,000 km) apart, which is close enough to influence each other's movement and development.[52]\nAfter a brief letup in activity, Tropical Storm Sean formed on October 11, in the eastern tropical Atlantic.[53] Later, on October 18, Hurricane Tammy formed.[54] It made landfall on Barbuda, the second system in three weeks to do so, in addition to Philippe.[55] A few days later, short-lived Tropical Depression Twenty-One formed offshore Nicaragua, moved inland, and soon dissipated.[56]\nThis season's ACE index as of November 14, 2023, as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the NHC, is approximately 145.6 units.[57] This number represents sum of the squares of the maximum sustained wind speed (knots) for all named storms while they are at least tropical storm intensity, divided by 10,000. Therefore, tropical depressions are not included.[5]\nOn January 16, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a special tropical weather outlook concerning a low-pressure area centered roughly 300 mi (480 km) north of Bermuda. The NHC noted that the low exhibited thunderstorm activity near its center but assessed it as unlikely to transition into a tropical or subtropical cyclone.[58] These thunderstorms may have developed due to the combination of the cyclone's position over the Gulf Stream, where sea surface temperatures around 68\u201370 \u00b0F (20\u201321 \u00b0C) and cold air aloft resulted in high atmospheric instability.[33] Contrary to expectations, a subtropical storm formed on January 16, about 345 mi (555 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Developing with sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), the system initially intensified, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) early on January 17. At 12:45 UTC, it made landfall at Louisbourg, Nova Scotia, as a weakening storm, then soon became a post-tropical low, before dissipating over far eastern Quebec the next day.[32]\nThere was no storm-related damage reported, likely because its most intense winds remained offshore.[2] The subtropical storm was located within a broader storm system that brought snowfall to parts of coastal New England, including up to 4.5 in (11 cm) in portions of Massachusetts, with 3.5 in (8.9 cm) of snow in Boston.[59] In Nova Scotia, the storm brought wind gusts of near 68 mph (110 km/h) to Sable Island.[32]\nOn May 30, the NHC began monitoring an area of disturbed weather over the eastern Gulf of Mexico for possible tropical development.[60] An area of low pressure developed the following day.[61] The system organized into Tropical Depression Two at 12:00 UTC on June 1, while located off the west coast of Florida.[62]Hurricane hunters investigated the depression on the morning of June 2, and determined that it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Arlene.[63] Moving southward, Arlene remained a minimal tropical storm throughout the day with sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). At 06:00 UTC on June 3, it weakened to a tropical depression. Six hours later, it degenerated into a remnant low, and then subsequently dissipated north of Cuba.[62] Arlene brought 2\u20136 in (51\u2013152 mm) of rainfall across South Florida, helping to reduce drought concerns along with other rains that week.[64]\nOn June 15, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave about to move off the coast of West Africa.[65] The disturbance became better organized due to warm sea surface temperatures and favorable atmospheric conditions.[66][67] On the morning of June 19, the disturbance organized into Tropical Depression Three about 1,495 mi (2,410 km) east of Barbados, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Bret that afternoon.[68] Gradual intensification occurred during the next couple of days as it headed west towards the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane hunters investigated Bret early on June 22 and found sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a central pressure of 996 mbar (29.4 inHg).[69] Soon after, Bret moved into an area of increased vertical wind shear, causing it to gradually weaken as it moved across the Lesser Antilles.[70] Overnight on June 22\u201323, it passed just north of Barbados and directly over St. Vincent.[71] Next, during the early hours of June 24, Bret passed just to the north of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao as a weakening storm with an exposed low-level center,[68] and soon opened into a trough near the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia.[72]\nOn June 18, the NHC began tracking a tropical wave that had recently moved off the coast of West Africa,[76] which became more organized the next day.[77] Though the system initially struggled to become better organized, it was in an environment overall conducive to development,[78][79] and organized into Tropical Depression Four on the morning of June 22, while about 1,395 mi (2,245 km) east of the Lesser Antilles.[80][81] Despite marginal atmospheric conditions, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Cindy early the next day. At 12:00 UTC on June 24, Cindy's sustained winds intensified to 60 mph (95 km/h). But later that day and continuing into the next, the storm grew progressively weaker. Then, at 06:00 UTC on June 26, Cindy dissipated about 375 mi (605 km) north-northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands.[80][82]\nA trough of low pressure formed over the central Atlantic on July 11, east-northeast of Bermuda.[83] Though the system remained embedded within the trough and had not developed a compact wind field, a well-defined center of circulation developed along with persistent deep convection early on July 14, prompting the NHC to classify it as Subtropical Storm Don early that morning.[84] Don's deep convection decreased later that day,[85] and it weakened to a subtropical depression early on July 16.[86] The next day, while beginning an anticyclonic loop over the central Atlantic, steered by a blocking ridge to its north, the system transitioned to a tropical depression.[87] Not long after, Don was upgraded to a tropical storm based on satellite wind data.[88] A few days later, while moving over the Gulf Stream on July 22, the storm quickly strengthened into the season's first hurricane.[89] Don remained a minimal Category 1 hurricane for several hours before weakening to a tropical storm early on July 23, when its structure quickly deteriorated as it moved over increasingly cooler waters north of the Gulf Stream.[90] Don continued to weaken due to cold waters and shear into the next day, transitioning to a post-tropical cyclone on July 24.[91]\nOn August 13, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a tropical wave coming off the coast of Africa, initially giving it a low chance of development through the next seven days.[92] The system struggled to organize amid conditions only marginally favorable, as it moved west-northwest over the open ocean. Eventually, it became sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate it Tropical Depression Six late on August 19.[93] The depression remained weak for a few days as it battled high vertical wind shear and otherwise unfavorable conditions before abruptly strengthening into Tropical Storm Gert at 04:00 UTC on August 22.[94] Soon however, increased wind shear from the outflow of nearby Tropical Storm Franklin caused Gert to weaken to a tropical depression that same afternoon. It subsequently lost its deep convection the following day, becoming a remnant low.[95][96] The low eventually opened up into a trough, but the remnants remained identifiable over the next week as the system trekked slowly northward into the central Atlantic.\nEarly on August 30, NHC began monitoring the remnants of Gert for potential redevelopment.[97] On September 1, the remnant low became well-defined, and the system regenerated into Tropical Depression Gert.[98] Gert continued its rebound, becoming a tropical storm once again later that day. Moving north-northeastward, its winds reached 60 mph (95 km/h) late on September 2, an intensification achieved in spite of strong northeasterly wind shear.[99] This intensity was maintained into the following day. Gert then began deteriorating while being drawn quickly northward and into the rotation around the larger remnant low of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, and dissipated early on September 4, over the north Atlantic.[100]\nOn August 16, a tropical wave being monitored by the NHC emerged off the coast of Africa into the eastern tropical Atlantic.[101] Over the next few days, the system gradually organized under generally favorable conditions. On August 20, satellite wind data indicated that it was producing gale-force winds in its northern side, and the center became well-defined, prompting the NHC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Emily later that day.[102] Shortly after its formation, Emily was already beginning to be affected by high wind shear and a dry environment, leaving its center exposed. Eventually, Emily became devoid of deep convection and became a post-tropical cyclone on August 21.[103] However, the NHC continued to monitor the system for the chance of it redeveloping.[104] The system showed some signs of reorganization as it moved through the subtropical Atlantic on August 24,[105] but failed to organize further, and started to dissipate later that day.[106] The remnants were then absorbed by an elongated area of low pressure well east-northeast of Bermuda late on August 25.[107]\nOn August 17, the NHC first noted the possibility that a low pressure area could soon form at the back end of a trough of low pressure as it headed westward towards the Leeward Islands.[108] The low formed on August 19, near the Windward Islands.[109] It soon formed a well-defined center, after which the NHC designated the system as Tropical Storm Franklin on the afternoon of August 20.[110] While moving through the eastern Caribbean over the next couple of days, Franklin struggled to become better organized while battling strong westerly wind shear pushing most of its convection east of its center.[40][111] Early on August 23, the storm began moving northwestward before turning northward, becoming somewhat better organized and to intensify. Franklin then made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) south of Barahona, Dominican Republic, shortly before 12:00 UTC that day.[112][113]\nWeakening occurred after Franklin made landfall, and it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean at 21:00 UTC as a minimal tropical storm.[114] After struggling with strong westerly shear and land interaction for several days, Franklin entered a more favorable environment for development on August 25 and promptly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane the next morning.[115] A further decrease in wind shear along with less dry air allowed Franklin to begin to rapidly intensify, becoming the season's first major hurricane at 09:00 UTC on August 28.[116] Franklin then began to intensify even more rapidly, quickly becoming a Category 4 hurricane a few hours later,[117] and then reaching its peak maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). After that, Franklin underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, causing it to begin to slowly weaken. That trend continued after the cycle was completed as wind shear from the outflow of Hurricane Idalia increased over Franklin and by 09:00 UTC on August 30, it had weakened to Category 2 strength.[118] Later that day, Franklin turned east-northeastward and passed north of Bermuda. While doing so, the storm's eye structure began to deteriorate due to strong northerly wind shear.[119] Then, on September 1, Franklin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 790 mi (1,270 km) northeast of Bermuda, with Category 1-equivalent winds of 85 mph (140 km/h).[120] By September 4, ex\u2011Franklin was located north of the Azores. That afternoon, the NHC began to monitor the system once again, as it was expected to soon move southeastward towards warmer waters.[121] Some reorganization did take place,[122] but the system did not redevelop into a tropical cyclone. The NHC stopped monitoring the post-tropical cyclone on September 7.[123]\nFranklin brought heavy rainfall and wind, causing damage to buildings, homes, and light posts.[124] Two fatalities were reported in the Dominican Republic, with an additional person also missing.[124] At least 350 people were displaced, and more than 500 homes and 2,500 roads were affected or damaged.[125] Several communities in the Dominican Republic were cut off, and nearly 350,000 homes were left without power, and an additional 1.6 million homes were cut off from potable water.[125]\nOn August 15, the NHC began to monitor the Gulf of Mexico,[126] in anticipation that a tropical wave moving into the eastern Caribbean would enter the Gulf within a few days, and there interact with the remnants of an old cold front, initiating tropical cyclogenesis.[127] After passing to the south of the Bahamas and between Cuba and Florida,[128] the disturbance reached the Gulf of Mexico and began to become better organized on August 20\u201321, amid near record-warm sea surface temperatures of 86\u201390 \u00b0F (30\u201332 \u00b0C).[129] Due to the threat the developing system posed to the South Texas Gulf Coast, the NHC initiated advisories on it at 15:00 UTC. on August 21, designating it Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine.[130] The system developed into Tropical Depression Nine about six hours later.[131] Moving quickly westward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Harold at 06:00 UTC on August 22.[132] Harold strengthened some more before making landfall on Padre Island, in the Texas Coastal Bend region, at around 15:00 UTC that day with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h).[133][134] Six hours later, it weakened into a tropical depression.[135] Early on August 23, it degenerated to a remnant low as its circulation became increasingly ill-defined.[136]\nHarold generated modest storm surge as it approached landfall. The highest surge, 2.2 ft (0.67 m), occurred at San Luis Pass.[137] The storm brought 2\u20134 in (51\u2013102 mm) of rain to coastal southern Texas.[134]Corpus Christi received 5.25 in (133 mm) of rain from the system, including a daily record 4.74 in (120 mm) on August 22.[134] Tropical storm-force winds also spread across the region. Wind gusts reached up to 65 mph (105 km/h) at Corpus Christi and 67 mph (108 km/h) at Loyola Beach.[138] Over 35,000 customers across southern Texas lost power.[139] The London Independent School District was shut down for several days due to damage sustained during the storm.[140] Harold also brought heavy rain and strong wind to parts of northern Mexico, but caused only minor damage as it moved through.[141] In Piedras Negras, 4 inches (100 mm) of rain fell within a few hours.[142]\nOn August 24, a trough of low pressure formed in the Eastern Pacific basin offshore of the Central America coast.[143] The disturbance crossed over into the Atlantic basin and began to organize as it moved northward through the western Caribbean Sea. The pace of organization quickened on August 26, while the disturbance was located near the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and that afternoon was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ten.[144] Later that day, and into the next, the depression drifted due to weak surrounding steering currents, with its center moving in a small counter-clockwise loop.[145][146] The depression became Tropical Storm Idalia at 15:15 UTC on August 27, after a NOAA Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the storm's winds had increased to 40 mph (65 km/h).[147] Early the next morning, Idalia began moving northward[148] toward the Yucat\u00e1n Channel west of Cuba, intensifying along the way.[149] By early morning on August 29, after passing near the western tip of Cuba, the storm had developed sufficiently to be classified a Category 1 hurricane.[150] Then, benefiting from exceptional environmental conditions,[151] Idalia began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 2 strength later that day.[152] Rapid intensification continued as the storm accelerated northward through the Gulf of Mexico and Idalia reached Category 4 strength on the morning of August 30, a few hours prior to landfall, reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg).[153] Idalia's strengthening was then halted by an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused it to weaken slightly before it made landfall at 11:45 UTC, about 20 miles (30 km) south of Perry, Florida, with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h).[154] Idalia quickly weakened as it moved inland into southeast Georgia,[155] and it was downgraded to a tropical storm at 21:00 UTC that same day.[156] Strong southwesterly wind shear then pushed the storm's convection well north and east of its center as it moved off the northeastern South Carolina coast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean early on August 31.[157] That afternoon, while southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, Idalia transitioned to a post-tropical cyclone.[158] The storm then moved slowly eastward and impacted Bermuda with tropical-storm-force winds on September 2, as it passed just to the south. Idalia's remnant low then absorbed Tropical Storm Gert,[100] turned northward, and lingered off the coast of Atlantic Canada for several days before dissipating on September 7.[159]\nOn August 26, 33 Florida counties were placed under a state of emergency (SOE) by Governor Ron DeSantis.[160] Two days later, the governor declared 13 more counties, including some in Northeast Florida, under a SOE.[161] On August 28, hurricane warnings and storm surge warnings were issued for portions of the state's west coast.[149] Idalia caused significant damage across the Big Bend region of Florida and southeastern Georgia. Thousands of structures were damaged or destroyed and four people died in storm-related incidents in the two states. Early estimates placed insured losses at $2.2\u20135 billion. The hurricane's remnants produced dangerous rip currents across the Eastern United States during Labor Day Weekend, resulting in at least five additional deaths and numerous rescues.[162]\nOn August 19, a vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa.[163] It traversed the Cabo Verde Islands, where an area of low-pressure formed late on August 23.[164] For several days, the disturbance was unable to become better organized.[165] The low at last become better defined on the morning of August 29, after persistent deep convection reignited over the eastern side of the circulation. That afternoon, it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven.[166] The depression meandered due weak steering currents over the next two days, and by August 30, had become less organized due to westerly shear.[167] However, the shear briefly relaxed, and the storm's convective bursting pattern abruptly evolved into curved banding early on August 31, signifying that the depression had strengthened into Tropical Storm Jose.[168] Further development was slow to come as Jose's banding features remained limited, and the convection at its center was shallow.[169] Even so, going into the early morning of September 1, the storm structure improved markedly as convection near the center deepened and a small mid-level eye feature appeared.[170][171] As a result, Jose's maximum sustained winds increased to 60 mph (95 km/h).[172] This intensification was short lived however, and the storm soon began to weaken due to northerly shear from Hurricane Franklin's outflow.[173] Jose then accelerated northward, pulled by the larger and stronger Franklin,[174] and was absorbed into the latter late that day.[175]\nOn August 28, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa.[176] A broad area of low pressure formed two days later near the Cabo Verde Islands.[177] On August 31, the disturbance began exhibiting signs that it was becoming better organized, and the low became better defined by the next morning.[178] As a result, it was designated Tropical Depression Twelve by the NHC at 15:00 UTC on September 1.[179] The following morning, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Katia.[180] On September 2, Katia's internal structure became better defined and its sustained winds reached 60 mph (95 km/h) that evening.[181] Overnight, however, increasing wind shear caused Katia to begin a weakening trend as its surface center became displaced far to the south of a remnant area of convection.[182] By 03:00 UTC on September 4, far northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression.[183] Then, late that day, it degenerated into a remnant low.[184]\nOn September 2, a tropical wave emerged into the tropical Atlantic from the west coast of Africa.[185] An area of low pressure formed from the wave two days later to the west-southwest of Cabo Verde.[186] On September 5, the low became more organized, with multiple low-level bands developing and formation of a well-defined center. Consequently, advisories were initiated on Tropical Depression Thirteen at 15:00 UTC that day.[187] Amid favorable conditions for intensification, the depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Lee six hours later.[188] Lee continued to intensify as it became better organized, with convective banding increasing and an eye beginning to form the following afternoon. By 21:00 UTC on September 6, the system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane[189] while located far to the east of the northern Leeward Islands.[190] Then, during the 24\u2011hour period ending at 06:00 UTC on September 8, Lee experienced explosive intensification, and reached Category 5 strength, with its winds increasing by 85 mph (135 km/h) to 165 mph (265 km/h).[46]\nSeveral hours later however, an increase of southwesterly wind shear, caused Lee's eye to become cloud filled and the storm became more asymmetric, causing it weaken back to a high-end Category 4 hurricane.[191] The pace of weakening quickened as the day progressed, and by early on September 9, Lee had become a low-end Category 3 hurricane.[192] Later that day, data from an evening hurricane hunters mission into the storm revealed that Lee was undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and still being adversely affected by modest vertical wind shear; observed peak flight level winds were down from an earlier mission. As a result of these findings, the hurricane was downgraded to Category 2 at 03:00 UTC on September 10.[193] Afterwards, as the eyewall replacement cycle was concluding, the wind shear abated, which permitted the new, larger-diameter eye to contract and to grow more symmetric; as a result, Lee intensified to Category 3 strength once again that same day.[194] The system underwent two more eyewall replacement cycles over the course of the next day and a half, and while they caused some fluctuations in its size and intensity, Lee remained a major hurricane throughout.[47][195]\nAfter tracking west-northwestward to northwestward for much of its trans\u2011Atlantic journey, Lee turned northward on September 13, moving around the western side of the steering subtropical ridge. That same day, it also weakened to Category 2 strength.[196][197] Then, on the morning of September 14, Lee became a Category 1 hurricane while approaching Bermuda,[198] which it passed to the west by 185 mi (300 km) later in the day.[199] As it pushed northward, continued drier air entrainment and increasingly strong southerly wind shear displaced Lee's convection to the northern side of the system, weakening it further. These factors caused the hurricane to commence its extratropical transition,[200] which was completed by 09:00 UTC on September 16.[201] Later that day, the center of the cyclone made landfall on Long Island, in Nova Scotia.[202] Through the overnight hours into September 17, Lee traversed New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland before moving into the Northern Atlantic.[203]\nSwells generated by Lee caused dangerous surf and rip currents along the entire Atlantic coast of the United States. Strong winds with hurricane\u2011force gusts caused extensive power outages in the U.S. state of Maine, and in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Three storm-related fatalities have been confirmed: a 15-year-old boy drowned in Fernandina Beach, Florida; a 50-year-old man died in Searsport, Maine, when a tree fell onto the car he was in; and a 21-year-old man who was killed in Manasquan Inlet, New Jersey when the boat he was in capsized and sunk due to a tall wave.[204][205]\nOn September 3, the NHC began to monitor a strong tropical wave moving westward across western Africa.[206] The wave moved into the western Atlantic Ocean two days later, and a broad area of low-pressure with a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms quickly formed within it shortly afterwards.[207] Shower and thunderstorm activity within the disturbance become better organized around an increasingly well-defined low-level center on September 7,[208] and Tropical Depression Fourteen formed about 160 mi (255 km) west of Cabo Verde.[209] Later the same day, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Margot.[210] Initially, northerly shear and dry mid-level air intruding from the southwest made it difficult for Margot to become better organized. These hindrances were offset by bursts of deep convection and a diffluent outflow pattern on September 9, allowing for some intensification to occur.[211] Margot continued to intensify gradually over the next couple of days while moving toward the north through the central Atlantic, and a ragged, but partially open eye emerged from the central dense overcast on the morning of September 11.[212] Later that day, Margot's eye became more defined and its overall structure improved, and the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.[213] It continued along a north to north-northwest track for a few days, exhibiting a double eyewall with a well-defined inner core, reaching maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on September 13.[214] It then became caught in weak steering currents by a building mid-level ridge to its north and drifted east-southeastward as it began to make a clockwise loop. Margot's slow motion upwelled cooler waters and that coupled with large amounts of dry air caused it to weaken to a tropical storm on September 15.[215] High wind shear and large amounts of dry air continued to negatively affect Margot and weakening continued as the storm's convection began to become increasingly displaced from the system's center.[216] It became bereft of organized deep convection on September 18, and transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone.[217]\nOn September 9, the NHC began monitoring an area of low pressure producing a concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms southwest of Cabo Verde, as well a tropical wave located inland near the coast of West Africa.[218] After it moved into the tropical Atlantic, a broad area of low pressure formed along the wave on September 11, southeast of the other disturbance.[219] The disturbances began to merge on September 12,[220] and by the next day, the dominant western low was showing some signs of organization.[221] Development continued, and the low became Tropical Depression Fifteen on September 15, far to the east of the Lesser Antilles.[222] Initially, the depression had a very broad structure and its deep convection fluctuated in intensity and organization for about a day without the low-level center becoming better defined.[223] Late on September 16, the depression finally started to become better organized with convective banding developing in its northern semicircle, and became Tropical Storm Nigel early the next morning.[224] Nigel slowly but steadily became better organized, and strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the morning of September 18, as an eyewall began to develop.[225] However, the strengthening trend was interrupted when dry air disrupted the storm's inner core.[226]\nLater, Nigel's eye become better defined and warmer once again, though convection on the north side was still being disrupted by intruding dry air.[227] Nonetheless, the system's 50\u201360 mi-wide (85\u201395 km) eye was soon fully surrounded by a solid band of deep convection, enabling Nigel to become a Category 2 hurricane late that afternoon.[228] It then turned northward, moving along the western edge of a mid-level ridge over the central subtropical Atlantic.[229] By the end of the day however, deep convection became limited to the southern portion of the band due to a break in the eyewall.[230] Unable to fill in the breach completely, Nigel weakened to Category 1 strength on September 20.[231] The hurricane's motion later shifted to the north-northeast, then toward the northeast on September 21, and accelerated, within the flow on the southeastern side of a strong mid-latitude trough. At the same time, increasing southwesterly wind shear began causing an elongation of Nigel's cloud pattern, resulting in further weakening.[232] Later, as the system raced northeastward at 37 mph (59 km/h), its environment became more hostile as the wind shear became very strong and sea surface temperatures fell to below 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C).[233] Consequently, Nigel's winds weakened to tropical storm strength and it transitioned to an extra-tropical cyclone on the morning of September 22, about 640 mi (1,030 km) north-northwest of the Azores.[234]\nOn September 17, the NHC first noted the potential for tropical cyclone development near the southeast coast of the United States in its seven-day outlook.[235] A few days later, a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms developed east of Florida within an offshore trough of low pressure.[236] A broad non-tropical area of low pressure formed within the area on September 21. Anticipating that the low could acquire some tropical or subtropical characteristics as it continued to form, coupled with its close proximity to the Southeastern United States, the NHC initiated advisories on it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen at 15:00 UTC that day.[237] The system's minimum barometric pressure fell appreciably on the morning of September 22, as it moved generally northward, still attached to a frontal feature. It was generating sustained tropical storm-force winds within its broad, asymmetric wind field, and the deep convection was concentrated to the north of the poorly formed, indistinct low level center of the circulation.[238] Later that day, it became detached from the frontal feature, and was designated Tropical Storm Ophelia.[49] The storm made landfall at 10:15 UTC, near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, about 25 mi (40 km) west-northwest of Cape Lookout, with winds of 70 mph (115 km/h).[239] Inland, Ophelia weakened as it moved northward through the state, and became a tropical depression that evening, after it crossed into southeast Virginia.[240] By 03:00 UTC on September 24, the system had lost its tropical characteristics, becoming a post-tropical cyclone.[241] The next day, its remnant circulation moved eastward off the New Jersey coast, as rains from the system swept northward into New England.[242] The remnants of Ophelia were absorbed by another offshore low-pressure area a few days later.[243]\nOn September 15, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave located inland over West Africa,[251] which moved offshore several days later.[252] On September 20, the wave began interacting with a disturbance just to its west, giving rise to a broad area of low\npressure the next day.[253] The disturbance developed a well-defined center on the morning of September 23, west of Cabo Verde, and deep convection associated with it became sufficiently organized to support formation of Tropical Depression Seventeen.[254] Later that day, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Philippe.[51] The storm strengthened some on the morning of September 24, as it moved westward through warm waters, steered along the southern side of a mid-level ridge.[255] Philippe struggled, however, to become better organized overall, due to persistent 25\u201330 mph (35\u201345 km/h) deep-layer west-southwesterly wind shear. As a result, its center became fully exposed and far removed to the west of the deep convection the following day.[256] Even so, there was a convective burst that formed near the center of circulation center late on September 26,[257] which continued into the following day. A convective band also began developing on the eastern side of the circulation.[258] Philippe's structure deteriorated somewhat on September 28, with satellite images showing an elongated circulation and multiple centers. As there was some deep convection on the east and southeast sides of what NHC determined was the main center, the system still met the requisite criteria of a tropical cyclone.[259] The storm also stalled, generally drifting to the southwest due to its interaction with Tropical Storm Rina to its east. Philippe remained adrift the following morning, and sheared, with the low-level center pushed to near the western edge of the main area of deep convection.[260] Philippe continued moving erratically for the next few days, strong northwesterly wind shear precluded any significant strengthening from occurring during this time.[261] On October 2, the storm turned toward the northwest, and made landfall on Barbuda that evening,[262] before passing near the U.S. Virgin Islands the next day.[263] Philippe turned northward on October 4, and weakened some due to wind shear, thunderstorm activity became limited to the southeastern quadrant of its circulation and winds of the western side fell to less than tropical storm-force.[264] The storm then transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone two days later as it approached Bermuda.[265][266]\nIn Guadeloupe, some areas were left without running water, and 2,500 power outages occurred.[267][268] Several homes and vehicles in Antigua and Barbuda were inundated by floodwaters.[268] Multiple schools were also damaged, and rainfall in Vieux-Fort, Guadeloupe, reached 380 mm (15 in).[269][270] Off the U.S. Virgin Islands, 12 people were rescued after a ship started to submerge in rough seas.[271][272] A cold front and Philippe's post-tropical remnants combined to bring up to 6 in (150 mm) to parts of Maine on October 7\u20138.[273] Gusts in the state were in the 50\u201360 mph (80\u201397 km/h) range.[274]\nOn September 23, NHC began to monitor a tropical wave just offshore of West Africa.[275] A broad area of low pressure formed the next day,[276] and the showers and thunderstorms within this disturbance began showing signs of organization a couple days later.[277] Moving west-northwest amid favorable conditions, a well-defined center formed within the disturbance early on September 28, at which time it was designated as Tropical Storm Rina.[278] The next day, Rina's wind field became slightly larger and stronger.[279] But it only intensified for a brief time before weakening once again[280] on account of strong northeasterly wind shear and dry mid-level air.[281] Rina became devoid of organized deep convection early on October 1, and its surface circulation became increasingly ill-defined during the day. Consequently, the system degenerated into a remnant low.[282]\nOn October 6, a potent low-latitude tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa.[283] The low became better organized on October 10, and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen late that day.[284] The next morning, the depression became Tropical Storm Sean about 725 mi (1,165 km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde.[285] Sean remained a highly sheared storm into the next day, with its center located well west of the associated deep convection.[286] Later, after weakening to depression strength overnight,[287] the system restrengthened back into a tropical storm on the morning of October 12.[288] Little additional organization occurred; by the morning of October 14, convective bursts became intermittent and fairly short lived, and the storm weakened once more to a tropical depression.[289] Thereafter, Sean degraded slowly, lingering for a day and a half before becoming a remnant low by very late on October 15.[290]\nOn October 11, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave located just offshore of west Africa.[291] Showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance became more concentrated and better organized on October 14,[292] but nearby dry air infiltrated the system, suppressing convection to some degree.[293] Later, when environmental conditions became more conducive, thunderstorm activity within the disturbance was able to become more organized on October 17.[294] The following afternoon, satellite imagery indicated a well-defined low-level surface circulation, prompting the NHC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Tammy.[54] Despite having a sheared appearance due to light to moderate westerly vertical wind shear, hurricane hunter data indicated that Tammy was strengthening as it moved quickly westward through record-warm waters towards the Leeward Islands on October 19.[295][296] The storm's inner core became better organized the following morning. Radar imagery showed that strong convection had quickly evolved into a curved band, and a closed eye. Meanwhile, aircraft data showed that its central pressure had fallen quickly, and sustained winds increased. As a result, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.[297] Later, Tammy passed to the east-southeast of Guadeloupe,[298] and then at 01:15 UTC on October 22, made landfall on Barbuda at its initial peak intensity of 85 mph (137 km/h).[299] It pulled away from the Leeward Islands throughout the day, though heavy rains still impacted the islands.[300] After weakening to a minimal hurricane while struggling against wind shear for a couple of days, Tammy began to strengthen on October 25 due to increasing upper-level divergence associated with a deep-layer trough.[301] Later that day, it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane and reached its peak intensity with sustained winds of 105 mph (169 km/h).[302] Shortly after peaking, Tammy then began to interact with a front to its north, which caused the hurricane to begin its transition to an extratropical cyclone. Tammy then merged with the front and transitioned into a strong extratropical cyclone early on October 26.[303] The next day, however, Tammy became detached from the front, and redeveloped into a tropical storm.[304] Not long afterward, environmental conditions began to deteriorate and strong vertical wind shear and dry air entrainment quickly stripped the storm of its convection and caused it to weaken. Tammy was then declared post-tropical again on October 29.[305]\nBarbuda received minimal damage while Antigua had only minor damage, though blackouts occurred across both islands. At least two families on Barbuda had to be evacuated.[55] Among the islands of Guadeloupe, only La D\u00e9sirade experienced hurricane force winds.[306] There were no reports of serious storm damage.[307] Rainfall amounts across the Leeward Islands were between 4 and 8 in (100 and 200 mm), and storm surge heights were between 1 and 3 ft (0.30 and 0.91 m).[308] Bermuda was impacted with wind gusts of 40 mph (65 km/h).[309]\nOn October 20, a broad area of low pressure developed over the far southwestern Caribbean Sea.[310] As the disturbance moved slowly towards the coast of Nicaragua on October 23, its surface circulation became more defined and heavy thunderstorm activity grew more intense and organized, resulting in the formation of Tropical Depression Twenty-One that afternoon.[311] It quickly made landfall in Nicaragua and dissipated the next day.[312] The remnants of the depression crossed over Central America and contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Pilar in the Eastern Pacific.[313]\nThe following list of names is being used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2023.

        "context": "\nFull Moons have long captivated cultures worldwide due to their mystical allure, with various beliefs and customs stemming from these celestial events. Our Full Moon Calendar gives you the date, time, and traditional name of the next full Moon\u2014as well as future occurrences for this year and the next. Be sure to share your photos with your community here in the comments below! Also, check out our Full Moon Horoscopes.\nThe next full Moon, the Beaver Moon, will occur on Monday, November 27, and reach peak illumination at 4:16 AM Eastern Time. Interestingly, although it reaches a \u201cfull\u201d phase for a brief moment, our eyes may perceive it to be full for up to three days!\nA full Moon is the phase when the Moon appears to be fully illuminated from Earth\u2019s perspective.\nThis occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in alignment, forming a straight line. The Moon and The Sun are on exact opposite sides of the Earth. From this position, the Sun\u2019s light shines directly onto the portion of the Moon that is visible to us and creates a full, bright circle of light.\nThis phase comes about 15 days after the New Moon at the approximate midpoint of the lunar cycle (29.5 days). Technically, it is only considered \u201cfull\u201d on one specific day. Before and after that, it is either waxing or waning, respectively\u2014no matter how full it appears to be. If you want to get even more technical, it is only \u201cfull\u201d for a brief instant. These are the times listed in our calendars.\nFull Moon names have their roots in the traditions of North American Native American tribes. These tribes honored the changing seasons by assigning unique names to each one. Interestingly, these captivating names encapsulated the essence of a whole month in which they appeared.\nWhile there might have been some variations in the names from tribe to tribe, a strong sense of consistency resonated among the different regions. On this rich cultural backdrop, European settlers arrived and embraced the custom, weaving in some of their own versions into the tapestry of time.\nA Supermoon occurs when the Moon is at least 90% of the way to its perigee position at the same time it is in its \u201cfull\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d phase. An extreme perigean Supermoon is when a new or full Moon happens at the same time as perigee.\nCan you have two full Moons in a month? Yes, when that happens, the second one is referred to as a \u201cblue.\u201d (Though it is not blue in color!) On average, this happens every two to three years.\nAs mentioned above, even though the Moon may look full to you a few days before or after the exact time we list above, the Moon is only considered to be full for a brief instant. This peak illumination may occur during the day in some parts of the world. Learn more about this phenomenon.\nWhile there\u2019s no real consensus on how Moons affect our moods and physical well-being, there are plenty of studies and real-life experiences that blame it for everything from increased crime and injuries to lack of sleep. What do you believe? (Share your experience in the comments below.)\nPeople often find when they align their energies with the specific lunar phases, they feel more inspired and productive. Tuning into nature and the environment around us has been shown to help us understand ourselves on a deeper level. This is why many people engage in monthly routines for self-care to get in alignment with the cycles of nature in order to gain perspective and reconnect with themselves.\nThe phases of the Moon can and do influence fish activity. Similar to deer, fish are most active during the days leading up to and following a full or new Moon. These periods can be particularly fruitful if moonrise or moonset align with sunrise or sunset.\nSaltwater fish are particularly susceptible to the Moon\u2019s phases, which cause unusually high and low tides. Higher tides may lure fish into new hunting areas, mainly if they coincide with the spawning of prey fish that can be easily traced. Conversely, lower tides might concentrate fish in locations not frequented during average water levels.\nWhile full Moons often garner the most attention, the other lunar phases are equally intriguing. How familiar are you with all the Moon phases? Can you identify the one that remains invisible to us? Or distinguish between waxing and waning?\nDo you have a favorite name from our Full Moon Calendar here? Which one?\nSubtract 1 hour from the given time on these charts and you have central.

        "context": "\nChinese New Year is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunisolarChinese calendar. In Chinese, the festival is commonly referred to as the Spring Festival (traditional Chinese: \u6625\u7bc0; simplified Chinese: \u6625\u8282; pinyin: Ch\u016bnji\u00e9)[2] as the spring season in the lunisolar calendar traditionally starts with lichun, the first of the twenty-four solar terms which the festival celebrates around the time of the Chinese New Year.[3] Marking the end of winter and the beginning of the spring season, observances traditionally take place from Chinese New Year's Eve, the evening preceding the first day of the year, to the Lantern Festival, held on the 15th day of the year. The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February.[note 1]\nChinese New Year is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, and has strongly influenced Lunar New Year celebrations of its 56 ethnic groups, such as the Losar of Tibet (Tibetan: \u0f63\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f66\u0f62\u0f0b), and of China's neighbours, including the Korean New Year (Korean: \uc124\ub0a0; RR: Seollal), and the T\u1ebft of Vietnam,[5] as well as in Okinawa.[6] It is also celebrated worldwide in regions and countries that house significant Overseas Chinese or Sinophone populations, especially in Southeast Asia. These include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar,[7] the Philippines,[8] Singapore,[9] Thailand, and Vietnam. It is also prominent beyond Asia, especially in Australia, Canada, Mauritius,[10] New Zealand, Peru,[11] South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as various European countries.[12][13][14]\nThe Chinese New Year is associated with several myths and customs. The festival was traditionally a time to honour deities as well as ancestors.[15] Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the New Year vary widely,[16] and the evening preceding the New Year's Day is frequently regarded as an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also a tradition for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill fortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Another custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red paper-cuts and couplets. Popular themes among these paper-cuts and couplets include good fortune or happiness, wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red envelopes.\nThe largest Chinese New Year parade outside Asia, in Chinatown, ManhattanTraditional paper cutting with the character \"Spring\" (\u6625)Chinese New Year decorations along New Bridge Road in SingaporeChinese New Year eve in Meizhou on 8 February 2005\nThe Chinese calendar defines the lunar month containing the winter solstice as the eleventh month, meaning that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an intercalary month intervenes).[17] In more than 96 per cent of the years, Chinese New Year's Day is the closest date to a new moon to lichun (Chinese: \u7acb\u6625; lit. 'establishment of spring') on 4 or 5 February, and the first new moon after dahan (Chinese: \u5927\u5bd2; lit. 'major cold'). In the Gregorian calendar, the Chinese New Year begins at the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February.[18]\nHand-written Chinese New Year's poetry pasted on the sides of doors leading to people's homes, Lijiang, Yunnan\nAccording to legend, Chinese New Year started with a mythical beast called the Nian (a beast that lives under the sea or in the mountains) during the annual Spring Festival. The Nian would eat villagers, especially children in the middle of the night.[19] One year, all the villagers decided to hide from the beast. An older man appeared before the villagers went into hiding and said that he would stay the night and would get revenge on the Nian. The old man put red papers up and set off firecrackers. The day after, the villagers came back to their town and saw that nothing had been destroyed. They assumed that the old man was a deity who came to save them. The villagers then understood that Yanhuang had discovered that the Nian was afraid of the color red and loud noises.[19] Then the tradition grew when New Year was approaching, and the villagers would wear red clothes, hang red lanterns, and red spring scrolls on windows and doors and used firecrackers and drums to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came to the village again. The Nian was eventually captured by Hongjun Laozu, an ancient Taoist monk.[20]\nBefore the new year celebration was established, ancient Chinese gathered and celebrated the end of harvest in autumn. However, this was not the Mid-Autumn Festival, during which Chinese gathered with family to worship the Moon. In the Classic of Poetry, a poem written during Western Zhou (1045 BC \u2013 771 BC) by an anonymous farmer, described the traditions of celebrating the 10th month of the ancient solar calendar, which was in autumn.[21] According to the poem, during this time people clean millet-stack sites, toast guests with mijiu (rice wine), kill lambs and cook their meat, go to their masters' home, toast the master, and cheer the prospect of living long together. The 10th-month celebration is believed to be one of the prototypes of Chinese New Year.[22]\nThe records of the first Chinese new year celebration can be traced to the Warring States period (475 BC \u2013 221 AD). In the L\u00fcshi Chunqiu, in Qin state an exorcism ritual to expel illness, called \"Big Nuo\" (\u5927\u513a), was recorded as being carried out on the last day of the year.[23][24] Later, Qin unified China, and the Qin dynasty was founded; and the ritual spread. It evolved into the practice of cleaning one's house thoroughly in the days preceding Chinese New Year.\nThe first mention of celebrating at the start of a new year was recorded during the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD). In the book Simin Yueling (\u56db\u6c11\u6708\u4ee4), written by the Eastern Han agronomist Cui Shi (\u5d14\u5bd4), a celebration was described: \"The starting day of the first month, is called Zheng Ri. I bring my wife and children, to worship ancestors and commemorate my father.\" Later he wrote: \"Children, wife, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren all serve pepper wine to their parents, make their toast, and wish their parents good health. It's a thriving view.\"[25] The practice of worshipping ancestors on New Year's Eve is maintained by Chinese people to this day.[26]\nHan Chinese also started the custom of visiting acquaintances' homes and wishing each other a happy new year. In Book of the Later Han, volume 27, a county officer was recorded as going to his prefect's house with a government secretary, toasting the prefect, and praising the prefect's merit.[27][28]\nDuring the Jin dynasty (266 \u2013 420 AD), people started the New Year's Eve tradition of all-night revelry called shousui (\u5b88\u6b72). It was described in Western Jin general Zhou Chu's article Fengtu Ji (\u98a8\u571f\u8a18 \u201cNotes on Local Conditions\u201d): \"At the ending of a year, people gift and wish each other, calling it Kuisui (\u994b\u6b72 \u201cgift time\u201d); people invited others with drinks and food, calling it Biesui (\u5225\u6b72 \u201cothers time\u201d); on New Year's Eve, people stayed up all night until sunrise, calling it Shousui (\u5b88\u6b72 \u201cguard the year\u201d).\"[29] The article used the word chu xi (\u9664\u5915) to indicate New Year's Eve, and the name is still used until this day.\nThe Northern and Southern dynasties book Jingchu Suishiji described the practice of firing bamboo in the early morning of New Year's Day,[30] which became a New Year tradition of the ancient Chinese. Poet and chancellor of the Tang dynasty Lai Gu also described this tradition in his poem Early Spring (\u65e9\u6625): \"\u65b0\u66c6\u624d\u5c06\u534a\u7eb8\u5f00\uff0c\u5c0f\u4ead\u7336\u805a\u7206\u7aff\u7070\", meaning \"Another new year just started as a half opening paper, and the family gathered around the dust of exploded bamboo pole\".[31] The practice was used by ancient Chinese people to scare away evil spirits, since firing bamboo would noisily crack or explode the hard plant.\nDuring the Tang dynasty, people established the custom of sending bai nian tie (\u62dc\u5e74\u5e16), which are New Year's greeting cards. It is said that the custom was started by Emperor Taizong of Tang. The emperor wrote \"\u666e\u5929\u540c\u6176\" (whole nation celebrate together) on gold leaves and sent them to his ministers. Word of the emperor's gesture spread, and later it became the custom of people in general, who used Xuan paper instead of gold leaves.[32] Another theory is that bai nian tie was derived from the Han dynasty's name tag, \"\u9580\u72c0\" (door opening). As imperial examinations became essential and reached their heyday under the Tang dynasty, candidates curried favour to become pupils of respected teachers, in order to get recommendation letters. After obtaining good examination marks, a pupil went to the teacher's home with a men zhuang (\u95e8\u72b6) to convey their gratitude. Therefore, eventually men zhuang became a symbol of good luck, and people started sending them to friends on New Year's Day, calling them by a new name, bai nian tie (\u62dc\u5e74\u5e16, New Year's Greetings).[33]\nThe Chunlian (Spring Couplets) was written by Meng Chang, an emperor of the Later Shu (935\u2013965 AD), during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period\uff1a\"\u65b0\u5e74\u7d0d\u9918\u6176\uff0c\u5609\u7bc0\u865f\u9577\u6625\" (Enjoying past legacies in the new year, the holiday foreseeing the long-lasting spring). As described by Song dynasty official Zhang Tangying in his book Shu Tao Wu, volume 2: on the day of New Year's Eve, the emperor ordered the scholar Xin Yinxun to write the couplets on peach wood and hang them on the emperor's bedroom door.[34][35] It is believed that placing the couplets on the door to the home in the days preceding the new year was widespread during the Song dynasty. The famous Northern Song politician, litterateur, philosopher, and poet Wang Anshi recorded the custom in his poem \"\u5143\u65e5\" (New Year's Day).[36]\n\u7206\u7af9\u8072\u4e2d\u4e00\u6b72\u9664\uff0c\n\u6625\u98a8\u9001\u6696\u5165\u5c60\u8607\u3002\n\u5343\u9580\u842c\u6236\u77b3\u77b3\u65e5\uff0c\n\u7e3d\u628a\u65b0\u6843\u63db\u820a\u7b26\u3002\nAmid the sound of firecrackers a year has come to an end,\nThe spring wind has wafted warm breath to the Tusu wine.\nWhile the rising sun shines over each and every household,\nPeople get rid of the old couplets and put up the new ones.\nThe poem Yuan Ri (\u5143\u65e5) also includes the word \"\u7206\u7af9\" (bao zhu, exploding bamboo), which is believed to be a reference to firecrackers, instead of the previous tradition of firing bamboo, both of which are called the same in the Chinese language. After gunpowder was invented in the Tang dynasty and widely used under the Song dynasty, people modified the tradition of firing bamboo by filling the bamboo pole with gunpowder, which made for louder explosions. Later under the Song, people discarded the bamboo and started to use paper to wrap the gunpowder in cylinders, in imitation of the bamboo. The firecracker was still called \"\u7206\u7af9\", thus equating the new and old traditions. It is also recorded that people linked the firecrackers with hemp rope and created the \"\u97ad\u70ae\" (bian pao, gunpowder whip) in the Song dynasty. Both \"\u7206\u7af9\" and \"\u97ad\u70ae\" are still used by present-day people to celebrate the Chinese New Year and other festive occasions.[37]\nIt was also during the Song dynasty that people started to give money to children in celebration of a new year. The money was called sui nian qian (\u968f\u5e74\u94b1), meaning \"the money based on age\". In the chapter \"Ending of a year\" (\u6b72\u9664) of Wulin jiushi (\u6b66\u6797\u820a\u4e8b), the writer recorded that concubines of the emperor prepared a hundred and twenty coins for princes and princesses, to wish them long lives.[38]\nThe new year celebration continued under the Yuan dynasty, when people also gave nian gao (\u5e74\u7cd5, year cakes) to relatives.[39]\nThe tradition of eating Chinese dumplings jiaozi (\u9903\u5b50) was established under the Ming dynasty at the latest. It is described in the book Youzhongzhi (\u914c\u4e2d\u5fd7): \"People get up at 5 in the morning of new year's day, burn incense and light firecrackers, throw door latch or wooden bars in the air three times, drink pepper and thuja wine, eat dumplings. Sometimes put one or two silver currency inside dumplings, and whoever gets the money will attain a year of fortune.\"[40] Modern Chinese people also put other food that is auspicious into dumplings: such as dates, which prophesy a flourishing new year; candy, which predicts sweet days; and nian gao, which foretells a rich life.\nIn the Qing dynasty, the name ya sui qian (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322, New Year's Money) was given to the lucky money given to children at the new year. The book Qing Jia Lu (\u6e05\u5609\u9304) recorded: \"elders give children coins threaded together by a red string, and the money is called Ya Sui Qian.\"[41] The name is still used by modern Chinese people. The lucky money was presented in one of two forms: one was coins strung on red string; the other was a colourful purse filled with coins.[42]\nIn 1928, the ruling Kuomintang party decreed that the Chinese New Year would fall on 1 Jan of the Gregorian Calendar, but this was abandoned due to overwhelming popular opposition. In 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, official Chinese New Year celebrations were banned in China. The State Council of the People's Republic of China announced that the public should \"change customs\"; have a \"revolutionized and fighting Spring Festival\"; and since people needed to work on Chinese New Year Eve, they did not need holidays during Spring Festival day. The old celebrations were reinstated in 1980.[43]\nWhile \"Chinese New Year\" remains the official name for the festival in Taiwan, the name \"Spring Festival\" was adopted by the People's Republic of China instead. On the other hand, some in the Chinese diaspora use the term \"Lunar New Year\", while \"Chinese New Year\" remains a popular and convenient translation for people of non-Chinese cultural backgrounds. Along with the Han Chinese in and outside Greater China, as many as 29 of the 55 ethnic minority groups in China also celebrate Chinese New Year. Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines celebrate it as an official festival.[44]\nChinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in some countries and territories where there is a sizeable Chinese population. Since Chinese New Year falls on different dates on the Gregorian calendar every year on different days of the week, some of these governments opt to shift working days in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. In some countries, a statutory holiday is added on the following work day if the New Year (as a public holiday) falls on a weekend, as in the case of 2013, where the New Year's Eve (9 February) falls on Saturday and the New Year's Day (10 February) on Sunday. Depending on the country, the holiday may be termed differently; common names in English are \"Chinese New Year\", \"Lunar New Year\", \"New Year Festival\", and \"Spring Festival\".\nFor New Year celebrations that are lunar but are outside of China and Chinese diaspora (such as Korea's Seollal and Vietnam's T\u1ebft), see the article on Lunar New Year.\nFor other countries and regions where Chinese New Year is celebrated but not an official holiday, see the table below.\nThe first 3 days of Chinese New Year. Extra holiday days are de facto added adjusting the weekend days before and after the three days holiday, resulting in a full week of public holiday known as Golden Week.[53][54] During the Chunyun holiday travel season.\nChinese New Year's Eve and the first 3 days of Chinese New Year; will be made up on subsequent working days if any of the 4 days fall on Saturday or Sunday. The day before Chinese New Year's Eve is also designated as holiday, but as a bridge holiday, and will be made up on an earlier or later Saturday. Additional bridge holidays may apply, resulting in 9-day or 10-day weekends.[56][57][58]\nRed couplets and red lanterns are displayed on the door frames and light up the atmosphere. The air is filled with strong Chinese emotions. In stores in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other cities, products of traditional Chinese style have started to lead fashion trend[s]. Buy yourself a Chinese-style coat, get your kids tiger-head hats and shoes, and decorate your home with some beautiful red Chinese knots, then you will have an authentic Chinese-style Spring Festival.\n\u2014 Xinwen Lianbo, January 2001, quoted by Li Ren, Imagining China in the Era of Global Consumerism and Local Consciousness[61]\nDuring the festival, people around China will prepare different gourmet dishes for their families and guests. Influenced by the flourished cultures, foods from different places look and taste totally different. Among them, the most well-known ones are dumplings from northern China and Tangyuan from southern China.[citation needed]\nOn the eighth day of the lunar month prior to Chinese New Year, the Laba holiday (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u516b; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u516b; pinyin: l\u00e0b\u0101), a traditional porridge, Laba porridge (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u516b\u7ca5; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u516b\u7ca5; pinyin: l\u00e0b\u0101 zh\u014du), is served in remembrance of an ancient festival, called La, that occurred shortly after the winter solstice.[62] Pickles such as Laba garlic, which turns green from vinegar, are also made on this day. For those that practice Buddhism, the Laba holiday is also considered Bodhi Day. Layue (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u6708; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u6708; pinyin: L\u00e0yu\u00e8) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u8089; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u8089; pinyin: l\u00e0r\u00f2u). The porridge was prepared by the women of the household at first light, with the first bowl offered to the family's ancestors and the household deities. Every member of the family was then served a bowl, with leftovers distributed to relatives and friends.[63] It's still served as a special breakfast on this day in some Chinese homes. The concept of the \"La month\" is similar to Advent in Christianity. Many families eat vegetarian on Chinese New Year eve, the garlic and preserved meat are eaten on Chinese New Year day.\nReceive the Gods in Chinese New Year, (1900s)\nOn the days immediately before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their homes a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying \"Wash away the dirt on nin ya baat\" (Chinese: \u5e74\u5eff\u516b\uff0c\u6d17\u908b\u9062; pinyin: ni\u00e1n ni\u00e0n b\u0101, x\u01d0 l\u0101t\u00e0; Jyutping: nin4 jaa6 baat3, sai2 laap6 taap3 (laat6 taat3)), but the practice is not restricted to nin ya baat (the 28th day of month 12). It is believed the cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on the first day so that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away. Some people give their homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and paper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year.[64] Homes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and couplets. Purchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts need to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is considered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word \"hair\" (fa) and the word for \"prosperity\". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts outstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of gratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close business associates, and extended family members.\nIn many households where Buddhism or Taoism is observed, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly, and decorations used to adorn altars over the past year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts on Little New Year, to be replaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will also \"send gods back to heaven\" (Chinese: \u9001\u795e; pinyin: s\u00f2ngsh\u00e9n), an example would be burning a paper effigy of Zao Jun the Kitchen God, the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the Kitchen God can report to the Jade Emperor of the family household's transgressions and good deeds. Families often offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to \"bribe\" the deities into reporting good things about the family.\nPrior to the Reunion Dinner, a prayer of thanksgiving is held to mark the safe passage of the previous year. Confucianists take the opportunity to remember their ancestors, and those who had lived before them are revered. Some people do not give a Buddhist prayer due to the influence of Christianity, with a Christian prayer offered instead.\nThe day before the Chinese New Year (Chinese: \u9664\u5915) usually accompanied with a dinner feast, consisting of special meats are served at the tables, as a main course for the dinner and as an offering for the New Year. This meal is comparable to Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S. and remotely similar to Christmas dinner in other countries with a high percentage of Christians.\nIn northern China, it is customary to make jiaozi, or dumplings, after dinner to eat around midnight. Dumplings symbolize wealth because their shape resembles a Chinese sycee. In contrast, in the South, it is customary to make a glutinous new year cake (niangao) and send pieces of it as gifts to relatives and friends in the coming days. Ni\u00e1ng\u0101o [Pinyin] literally means \"new year cake\" with a homophonous meaning of \"increasingly prosperous year in year out\".[65]\nAfter dinner, some families may visit local temples hours before midnight to pray for success by lighting the first incense of the year; however in modern practice, many households held parties to celebrate. Traditionally, firecrackers were lit to ward evil spirits when the household doors sealed, and are not to be reopened until dawn in a ritual called \"opening the door of fortune\" (simplified Chinese: \u5f00\u8d22\u95e8; traditional Chinese: \u958b\u8ca1\u9580; pinyin: k\u0101ic\u00e1im\u00e9n).[66] A tradition of staying up late on Chinese New Year's Eve is known as shousui (Chinese: \u5b88\u5c81), which is still practised as it is thought to add on to one's parents' longevity.\nThe first day, known as the \"Spring Festival\" (simplified Chinese: \u6625\u8282; traditional Chinese: \u6625\u7bc0) is for the welcoming of the deities of the heavens and Earth on midnight. It is a traditional practice to light fireworks, burn bamboo sticks and firecrackers, and lion dance troupes, were done commonly as a tradition to ward off evil spirits.\nTypical actions such as lighting fires and using knives are considered taboo, thus all consumable food has to be cooked prior. Using the broom, swearing, and breaking any dinnerware without appeasing the deities are also considered taboo.[67]\nNormal traditions occurring on the first day involve house gatherings to the families, specifically the elders and families to the oldest and most senior members of their extended families, usually their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, and trading Mandarin oranges as a courtesy to symbolize wealth and good luck. Members of the family who are married also give red envelopes containing cash known as lai see (Cantonese: \u5229\u4e8b) or angpow (Hokkien and Teochew), or hongbao (Mandarin: \u7ea2\u5305), a form of a blessing and to suppress both the ageing and challenges that were associated with the coming year, to junior members of the family, mostly children and teenagers. Business managers may also give bonuses in the form of red packets to employees.[68] The money can be of any form, specifically numbers ending with 8, which sounded as huat (Mandarin: \u53d1), meaning prosperity, but packets with denominations of odd numbers or without money are usually not allowed due to bad luck, especially the number 4 which sounded as si (Mandarin: \u6b7b), which means death.[69][68]\nWhile fireworks and firecrackers are traditionally very popular, some regions have banned them due to concerns over fire hazards. For this reason, various city governments (e.g., Kowloon, Beijing, Shanghai for a number of years) issued bans over fireworks and firecrackers in certain precincts of the city. As a substitute, large-scale fireworks display have been launched by governments in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nIncense is burned at the graves of ancestors as part of the offering and prayer rituals\nThe second day, entitled \"a year's beginning\" (simplified Chinese: \u5f00\u5e74; traditional Chinese: \u958b\u5e74; pinyin: k\u0101ini\u00e1n),[70] oversees married daughters visiting their birth parents, relatives and close friends, often renew family ties and relationship. (Traditionally, married daughters didn't have the opportunity to visit their birth families frequently.)\nThe second day also saw giving offering money and sacrifices to God of Wealth (Chinese: \u8d22\u795e) to symbolize a rewarding time after hardship in the preceding year. During the days of imperial China, \"beggars and other unemployed people circulate[d] from family to family, carrying a picture [of the God of Wealth] shouting, \"Cai Shen dao!\" [The God of Wealth has come!].\"[71] Householders would respond with \"lucky money\" to reward the messengers. Business people of the Cantonese dialect group will hold a 'Hoi Nin' prayer to start their business on the second day of Chinese New Year, blessing business to strive in the coming year.\nThe third day is known as \"red mouth\" (Chinese: \u8d64\u53e3; pinyin: Ch\u00eck\u01d2u). Chikou is also called \"Chigou's Day\" (Chinese: \u8d64\u72d7\u65e5; pinyin: Ch\u00ecg\u01d2ur\u00ec). Chigou, literally \"red dog\", is an epithet of \"the God of Blazing Wrath\" (Chinese: \u719b\u6012\u4e4b\u795e; pinyin: Bi\u0101o n\u00f9 zh\u012b sh\u00e9n). Rural villagers continue the tradition of burning paper offerings over trash fires. It is considered an unlucky day to have guests or go visiting.[72] Hakka villagers in rural Hong Kong in the 1960s called it the Day of the Poor Devil and believed everyone should stay at home.[73] This is also considered a propitious day to visit the temple of the God of Wealth and have one's future told.\nIn those communities that celebrate Chinese New Year for 15 days, the fourth day is when corporate \"spring dinners\" kick off and business returns to normal. Other areas that have a longer Chinese New Year holiday will celebrate and welcome the gods that were previously sent on this day.\nThis day is the god of Wealth's birthday. In northern China, people eat jiaozi, or dumplings, on the morning of powu (Chinese: \u7834\u4e94; pinyin: p\u00f2w\u01d4). In Taiwan, businesses traditionally re-open on the next day (the sixth day), accompanied by firecrackers.\nIt is also common in China that on the 5th day people will shoot off firecrackers to get Guan Yu's attention, thus ensuring his favour and good fortune for the new year.[74]\nThe sixth day is Horse's Day, on which people drive away the Ghost of Poverty by throwing out the garbage stored up during the festival. The ways vary but basically have the same meaning\u2014to drive away the Ghost of Poverty, which reflects the general desire of the Chinese people to ring out the old and ring in the new, to send away the previous poverty and hardship and to usher in the good life of the New Year.[75]\nThe seventh day, traditionally known as Renri (the common person's birthday), is the day when everyone grows one year older. In some overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Singapore, it is also the day when tossed raw fish salad, yusheng, is eaten for continued wealth and prosperity.\nFor many Chinese Buddhists, this is another day to avoid meat, the seventh day commemorating the birth of Sakra, lord of the devas in Buddhist cosmology who is analogous to the Jade Emperor.\nAnother family dinner is held to celebrate the eve of the birth of the Jade Emperor, the ruler of heaven. People normally return to work by the eighth day, therefore the Store owners will host a lunch/dinner with their employees, thanking their employees for the work they have done for the whole year.\nThe ninth day is traditionally known as the birthday of the Jade Emperor of Heaven (Chinese: \u7389\u7687; pinyin: Y\u00f9 Hu\u00e1ng) and many people offered prayer in the Taoist Pantheon as thanks or gratitude.,[76] and it is commonly known as called Ti Kong Dan (Chinese: \u5929\u516c\u8a95; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Thi\u207f-kong Tan), Ti Kong Si (Chinese: \u5929\u516c\u751f; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Thi\u207f-kong Si\u207f/Thi\u207f-kong Se\u207f) or Pai Ti Kong (Chinese: \u62dc\u5929\u516c; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: P\u00e0i Thi\u207f-kong), which is especially important to Hokkiens other than the first day of the Chinese New Year.[77]\nA prominent requisite offering is sugarcane.[77] Legends holds that the Hokkien were spared from a massacre by Japanese pirates by hiding in a sugarcane plantation between the eighth and ninth days of the Chinese New Year, coinciding with the Jade Emperor's birthday.[77] \"Sugarcane\" (Chinese: \u7518\u8517; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: kam-chi\u00e0) is a near homonym to \"thank you\" (Chinese: \u611f\u8b1d; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: k\u00e1m-si\u0101) in the Hokkien dialect.[77]\nIn the morning (traditionally anytime between midnight and 7 am), Taiwanese households set up an altar table with three layers: one top (containing offertories of six vegetables (Chinese: \u516d\u9f4b; pinyin: li\u00f9 zh\u0101i; those being noodles, fruits, cakes, tangyuan, vegetable bowls, and unripe betel), all decorated with paper lanterns) and two lower levels (five sacrifices and wines) to honour the deities below the Jade Emperor.[76] The household then kneels three times and kowtows nine times to pay obeisance and wish him a long life.[76]\nIncense, tea, fruit, vegetarian food or roast pig, and gold paper, are served as a customary protocol for paying respect to an honoured person.\nThe fifteenth day of the new year is celebrated as the Lantern Festival, also known as the Yuanxiao Festival (simplified Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5\u8282; traditional Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5\u7bc0; pinyin: Yu\u00e1n xi\u0101o ji\u00e9), the Shangyuan Festival (simplified Chinese: \u4e0a\u5143\u8282; traditional Chinese: \u4e0a\u5143\u7bc0; pinyin: Sh\u00e0ng yu\u00e1n ji\u00e9), and Chap Goh Meh (Chinese: \u5341\u4e94\u669d; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Cha\u030dp-g\u014d\u0358-m\u00ea; lit. 'the fifteen night' in Hokkien). Rice dumplings, or tangyuan (simplified Chinese: \u6c64\u5706; traditional Chinese: \u6e6f\u5713; pinyin: tang yu\u00e1n), a sweet glutinous rice ball brewed in a soup, are eaten this day. Candles are lit outside houses as a way to guide wayward spirits home. Families may walk the streets carrying lanterns, which sometimes have riddles attached to or written on them as a tradition.[78]\nIn China and Malaysia, this day is celebrated by individuals seeking a romantic partner, akin to Valentine's Day.[79] Nowadays, single women write their contact number on mandarin oranges and throw them in a river or a lake after which single men collect the oranges and eat them. The taste is an indication of their possible love: sweet represents a good fate while sour represents a bad fate.\nA reunion dinner (ni\u00e1n y\u00e8 f\u00e0n) is held on New Year's Eve during which family members gather for a celebration.[80] The venue will usually be in or near the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and sumptuous and traditionally includes dishes of meat (namely, pork and chicken) and fish. Most reunion dinners also feature a communalhot pot as it is believed to signify the coming together of the family members for the meal. Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also prominently feature speciality meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and Chinese sausage) and seafood (e.g. lobster and abalone) that are usually reserved for this and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most areas, fish (simplified Chinese: \u9c7c; traditional Chinese: \u9b5a; pinyin: y\u00fa) is included, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase \"may there be surpluses every year\" (simplified Chinese: \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59; traditional Chinese: \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918; pinyin: ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa) sounds the same as \"let there be fish every year.\" Eight individual dishes are served to reflect the belief of good fortune associated with the number. If in the previous year a death was experienced in the family, seven dishes are served.\nOther traditional foods consists of noodles, fruits, dumplings,[81] spring rolls,[82] and Tangyuan[80] which are also known as sweet rice balls. Each dish served during Chinese New Year represents something special. The noodles used to make longevity noodles are usually very thin, long wheat noodles. These noodles are longer than normal noodles that are usually fried and served on a plate, or boiled and served in a bowl with its broth. The noodles symbolize the wish for a long life. The fruits that are typically selected would be oranges, tangerines, and pomelos as they are round and \"golden\" color symbolizing fullness and wealth. Their lucky sound when spoken also brings good luck and fortune. The Chinese pronunciation for orange is \u6a59 (ch\u00e9ng), which sounds the same as the Chinese for 'success' (\u6210). One of the ways to spell tangerine(\u6854 j\u00fa) contains the Chinese character for luck (\u5409 j\u00ed). Pomelos are believed to bring constant prosperity. Pomelo in Chinese (\u67da y\u00f2u) sounds similar to 'to have' (\u6709 y\u01d2u), disregarding its tone, however it sounds exactly like 'again' (\u53c8 y\u00f2u). Dumplings and spring rolls symbolize wealth, whereas sweet rice balls symbolize family togetherness.\nRed packets for the immediate family are sometimes distributed during the reunion dinner. These packets contain money in an amount that reflects good luck and honorability. Several foods are consumed to usher in wealth, happiness, and good fortune. Several of the Chinese food names are homophones for words that also mean good things.\nMany families in China still follow the tradition of eating only vegetarian food on the first day of the New Year, as it is believed that doing so will bring good luck into their lives for the whole year.[83]\nLike many other New Year dishes, certain ingredients also take special precedence over others as these ingredients also have similar-sounding names with prosperity, good luck, or even counting money.\nAn elaborate vegetarian dish served by Chinese families on the eve and the first day of the New Year. A type of black hair-like algae, pronounced \"fat choy\" in Cantonese, is also featured in the dish for its name, which sounds like \"prosperity\". Hakkas usually serve kiu nyuk (Chinese: \u6263\u8089; pinyin: k\u00f2ur\u00f2u) and ngiong teu fu.\nChicken\n\u9e21\n\u96de\nJ\u012b\nBoiled chicken is served because it is figured that any family, no matter how humble their circumstances, can afford a chicken for Chinese New Year.\nApples\n\u82f9\u679c\n\u860b\u679c\nP\u00ednggu\u01d2\nApples symbolize peace because the word for apple (\"ping\") is a homonym of the word for peace.\nFish\n\u9c7c\n\u9b5a\nY\u00fa\nIs usually eaten or merely displayed on the eve of Chinese New Year. The pronunciation of fish makes it a homophone for \"surpluses\"(simplified Chinese: \u4f59; traditional Chinese: \u9918; pinyin: y\u00fa).\nIs usually served in a dish with rondelles of Chinese sausage or Chinese cured meat during Chinese New Year. The pronunciation of Garlic makes it a homophone for \"calculating (money)\" (Chinese: \u7b97; pinyin: su\u00e0n). The Chinese cured meat is so chosen because it is traditionally the primary method for storing meat over the winter and the meat rondelles resemble coins.\nThe common dumpling eaten in northern China, also believed to resemble sycee. In the reunion dinner, Chinese people add various food into Jiaozi fillings to represent good fortune: coin, Niangao, dried date, candy, etc.\nMost popular in eastern China (Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai) because its pronunciation is a homophone for \"a more prosperous year (\u5e74\u9ad8 lit. year high)\". Niangao is also popular in the Philippines because of its large Chinese population and is known as tikoy (Chinese: \u751c\u7cbf, from Min Nan) there. Known as Chinese New Year pudding, niangao is made up of glutinous rice flour, wheat starch, salt, water, and sugar. The color of the sugar used determines the color of the pudding (white or brown).\nRaw fish salad. Eating this salad is said to bring good luck. This dish is usually eaten on the seventh day of the New Year, but may also be eaten throughout the period.\nFive Xinpan\n\u4e94\u8f9b\u76d8\n\u4e94\u8f9b\u76e4\nW\u01d4 x\u012bnp\u00e1n\nFive Xin include onion, garlic, pepper, ginger, mustard. As an ancient traditional folk culture, it has been existing since the Jin dynasty. It symbolizes health. In a well-economic development dynasty, like Song, The Five Xinpan not only have five spicy vegetables. Also, include Chinese bacon and other vegetables. Moreover, it offered to the family's ancestors to express respect and seek a blessing.[86]\nThis dish is eaten on Laba Festival, the eighth day of the twelfth month of the Chinese lunar calendar. The congees are made of mixed walnut, pine nuts, mushrooms, persimmon. The congees are for commemorating the sacrifices of ancestors and celebrating the harvest.[87]\nTraditionally, red envelopes or red packets\n(traditional Chinese: \u7d05\u5305; simplified Chinese: \u7ea2\u5305; Mandarinpinyin: h\u00f3ngb\u0101o; HokkienPe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: \u00e2ng-pau; HakkaPha\u030dk-fa-s\u1e73: f\u00f9ng-p\u00e2u), alternatively known as lai see particularly in Cantonese speaking areas (Chinese: \u5229\u662f / \u5229\u5e02 / \u5229\u4e8b; Cantonese Yale: laih sih; pinyin: l\u00ecsh\u00ec), are passed out during the Chinese New Year's celebrations, from married couples or the elderly to unmarried juniors or children. During this period, red packets are also known as yasuiqian (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322; \u538b\u5c81\u94b1; y\u0101su\u00ecqi\u00e1n), which was evolved from a homophonous phrase yasuiqian (\u58d3\u795f\u9322; \u538b\u795f\u94b1; y\u0101su\u00ecqi\u00e1n), literally meaning \"money to suppress evil spirits\".[88] According to legend, a demon named Sui patted a child on the head three times on New Year's Eve, and the child would have a fever. The parents wrapped coins in red paper and placed them next to their children's pillows. When Sui came, the flash of the coin scared him away. From then on, every New Year's Eve, parents will wrap the coin in red paper to protect their children.[89]\nRed packets almost always contain money, usually varying from a couple of dollars to several hundred. Chinese superstitions favour amounts that begin with even numbers, such as 8 (\u516b, pinyin: b\u0101), a homophone for \"wealth\", and 6 (\u516d, pinyin: li\u00f9), a homophone for \"smooth\"\u2014but not the number 4 (\u56db, pinyin: s\u00ec), which is a homophone of \"death\", and is, as such, considered unlucky in Asian culture. Odd numbers are also avoided, as they are associated with cash given during funerals (\u5e1b\u91d1, pinyin: b\u00e1ij\u012bn).[90][91] It is also customary for bills placed inside a red envelope to be new.[92]\nThe act of asking for red packets (Mandarin: \u8a0e\u7d05\u5305; t\u01ceo h\u00f3ngb\u0101o, Cantonese: \u9017\u5229\u662f; dauh laih sih) wouldn't be turned down by a married person as it would mean that he or she would be \"out of luck\" in the new year. Red packets are generally given by married couples to the younger non-married members of the family.[82] It is custom and polite for children to wish elders a happy new year and a year of happiness, health and good fortune before accepting the red envelope.[82] Red envelopes are then kept under the pillow and slept on for seven nights after Chinese New Year before opening because that symbolizes good luck and fortune.\nIn Taiwan in the 2000s, some employers also gave red packets as a bonus to maids, nurses or domestic workers from Southeast Asian countries, although whether this is appropriate is controversial.[93][94]\nIn ancient times, there was a monster named sui (\u795f) which comes out on New Year's Eve and touches the heads of sleeping children. The child will be frightened by the touch and wake up and have a fever. The fever eventually will cause the child to have intellectual disabilities. Hence, families will light up their homes and stay awake, leading to a tradition of shou sui (\u5b88\u795f), to guard against sui harming their children.\nA folklore tale of sui is about an elderly couple with a precious son. On the night of New Year's Eve, since they were afraid that sui would come, they took out eight pieces of copper coins to play with their son in order to keep him awake. Their son was very sleepy, however, so they let him go to sleep after placing a red paper bag containing the copper coins under the child's pillow. The two older children also stayed with him for the whole night. Suddenly, the doors and windows were blown open by a strange wind, and even the candlelight was extinguished. It turned out to be a sui. When the sui was going to reach out and touch the child's head, the pillow suddenly brightened with the golden light, and the sui was scared away, so the exorcism effect of \"red paper wrapped copper money\" spread in the past China[99] (see also Chinese numismatic charms). The money is then called \"ya sui qian (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322)\", the money to suppress sui.\nAnother tale is that a huge demon was terrorizing a village and there was nobody in the village who was able to defeat the demon; many warriors and statesmen had tried with no luck. A young orphan stepped in, armed with a magical sword that was inherited from his ancestors, and battled the demon, eventually killing it. Peace was finally restored to the village, and the elders all presented the brave young man with a red envelope filled with money to repay the young orphan for his courage and for ridding the village of the demon.[100]\nIn addition to red envelopes, which are usually given from older people to younger people, small gifts (usually food or sweets) are also exchanged between friends or relatives (of different households) during Chinese New Year. Gifts are usually brought when visiting friends or relatives at their homes. Common gifts include fruits (typically oranges, but never trade pears), cakes, biscuits, chocolates, and candies. Gifts are preferred to be wrapped with red or golden paper, which symbolizes good luck.\nCertain items should not be given, as they are considered taboo. Taboo gifts include:[101][102][103]\nitems that symbolize that you want to walk away from a relationship (examples: shoes and sandals)\nmirrors\nhomonyms for unpleasant topics (examples: \"clock\" sounds like \"the funeral ritual\" or \"the end of life\", green hats because \"wear a green hat\" sounds like \"cuckold\", \"handkerchief\" sounds like \"goodbye\", \"pear\" sounds like \"separate\", \"umbrella\" sounds like \"disperse\", and \"shoe\" sounds like a \"rough\" year).\nMarkets or village fairs are set up as the New Year is approaching. These usually open-air markets feature new year related products such as flowers, toys, clothing, and even fireworks and firecrackers. It is convenient for people to buy gifts for their new year visits as well as their home decorations. In some places, the practice of shopping for the perfect plum tree is not dissimilar to the Western tradition of buying a Christmas tree.\nA Chinese man setting off fireworks during Chinese New Year in Shanghai\nBamboo stems filled with gunpowder that was burnt to create small explosions were once used in ancient China to drive away evil spirits. In modern times, this method has eventually evolved into the use of firecrackers during the festive season. Firecrackers are usually strung on a long fused string so it can be hung down. Each firecracker is rolled up in red papers, as red is auspicious, with gunpowder in its core. Once ignited, the firecracker lets out a loud popping noise and, as they are usually strung together by the hundreds, the firecrackers are known for their deafening explosions that are thought to scare away evil spirits. The burning of firecrackers also signifies a joyful time of year and has become an integral aspect of Chinese New Year celebrations.[104] Since the 2000s, firecrackers have been banned in various countries and towns.\n\"Happy New Year!\" (Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u597d\u5440; pinyin: X\u012bn Ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo Ya) is a popular children's song for the New Year holiday.[105] The melody is similar to the American folk song, Oh My Darling, Clementine. Another popular Chinese New Year song is Gong Xi Gong Xi(Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u606d\u559c\uff01; pinyin: Gongxi Gongxi!)\n.\nWatching Chinese New Year films is an expression of Chinese cultural identity. During the New Year holidays, the stage boss gathers the most popular actors whom from various troupes let them perform repertories from Qing dynasty. Nowadays many people celebrate the new year by watching these movies.[106]\nThe color red is commonly worn throughout Chinese New Year; traditional beliefs held that red could scare away evil spirits.[82] The wearing of new clothes is another clothing custom during the festival;[107] the new clothes symbolize a new beginning in the year.[82]\nIn some places, the taking of a family portrait is an important ceremony after the relatives are gathered.[108] The photo is taken at the hall of the house or taken in front of the house. The most senior male head of the family sits in the center.\nAs with all cultures, Chinese New Year traditions incorporate elements that are symbolic of deeper meaning. One common example of Chinese New Year symbolism is the red diamond-shaped fu characters (Chinese: \u798f; pinyin: f\u00fa; Cantonese Yale: f\u016bk; lit. 'blessings', 'happiness'), which are displayed on the entrances of Chinese homes. This sign is usually seen hanging upside down, since the Chinese word for \"upside down\" (\u5012; d\u00e0o), is homophonous or nearly homophonous with the word for \"arrive\" (\u5230; d\u00e0o) in all varieties of Chinese. Therefore, it symbolizes the arrival of luck, happiness, and prosperity.\nFor Cantonese-speaking people, if the fu sign is hung upside down, the implied dao (upside down) sounds like the Cantonese word for \"pour\", producing \"pour the luck [away]\", which would usually symbolize bad luck; this is why the fu character is not usually hung upside-down in Cantonese communities.\nRed is the predominant color used in New Year celebrations. Red is the emblem of joy, and this color also symbolizes virtue, truth and sincerity. On the Chinese opera stage, a painted red face usually denotes a sacred or loyal personage and sometimes a great emperor. Candies, cakes, decorations and many things associated with the New Year and its ceremonies are coloured red. The sound of the Chinese word for \"red\" (pinyin: h\u00f3ng; Cantonese Yale: h\u00fang) is in Mandarin homophonous with the word for \"prosperous.\" Therefore, red is an auspicious color and has an auspicious sound.\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the year of the pig is a generally unlucky year for the public, which is why you need to reevaluate most of your decisions before you reach a conclusion. However, this only helps you get even more control over your life as you learn to stay ahead of everything by being cautious.[109]\nNianhua can be a form of Chinese coloured woodblock printing, for decoration during Chinese New Year.[110] Nianhua uses a range of subjects to express and invite positive prospects as the new year begins. The most popular representatives of these prospects take inspiration from nature, religion, folklore, etc., and are portrayed in flashy and lively ways.[111]\nrepresents fertility and abundance, as well as good taste, beauty, luxury and innocence\nEach flower has a symbolic meaning, and many Chinese people believe that it may usher in the values that it represents.[112] In general, except those in lucky colour like red and yellow, chrysanthemum should not be put at home during the new year, because it is normally used for ancestral veneration.[113]\nThese lanterns that differ from those of Mid-Autumn Festival in general. They will be red in color and tend to be oval in shape. These are the traditional Chinese paper lanterns. Those lanterns, used on the fifteenth day of the Chinese New Year for the Lantern Festival, are bright, colorful, and in many different sizes and shapes.\nDragon and lion dances are common during Chinese New Year. It is believed that the loud beats of the drum and the deafening sounds of the cymbals together with the face of the Dragon or lion dancing aggressively can evict bad or evil spirits. Lion dances are also popular for opening of businesses in Hong Kong and Macau.\nTraditionally, families gather together during the Chinese New Year. In modern China, migrant workers in China travel home to have reunion dinners with their families on Chinese New Year's Eve. Owing to a large number of interprovincial travellers, special arrangements were made by railways, buses and airlines starting from 15 days before the New Year's Day. This 40-day period is called chunyun, and is known as the world's largest annual migration.[114] More interurban trips are taken in China in this period than the total population of China.\nIn Taiwan, spring travel is also a major event. The majority of transportation in western Taiwan is in a north\u2013south direction: long-distance travel between urbanized north and hometowns in the rural south. Transportation in eastern Taiwan and that between Taiwan and its islands is less convenient. Cross-strait flights between Taiwan and China began in 2003 as part of Three Links, mostly for \"Taiwanese businessmen\" to return to Taiwan for the new year.[115]\nDecorations on the occasion of Chinese New Year \u2013 River Hongbao 2016, Singapore\nChinese New Year is also celebrated annually in many countries which houses significant Chinese populations. These include countries throughout Asia, Oceania, and North America. Sydney,[116] London,[117] and San Francisco[118] claim to host the largest New Year celebration outside of Asia and South America.\nIn Singapore, Chinese New Year is officially a two-day public holiday. Chinese New Year is accompanied by various festive activities. One of the main highlights is the Chinatown celebrations. In 2010, this included a Festive Street Bazaar, nightly staged shows at Kreta Ayer Square and a lion dance competition.[120] The Chingay Parade also features prominently in the celebrations. It is an annual street parade in Singapore, well known for its colourful floats and wide variety of cultural performances.[121] The highlights of the Parade for 2011 include a Fire Party, multi-ethnic performances and an unprecedented travelling dance competition.[122]\nIn the Philippines, Chinese New Year (Philippine Hokkien Chinese: \u54b1\u4eba\u5e74\u515c; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: L\u00e1n-n\u00e2ng N\u00ee-tau) is considered as one of the important festivals for Chinese Filipinos, and its celebration has also extended to the majority non-Chinese Filipinos, especially since in 2012, Chinese New Year was included as a public regular non-working holiday in the Philippines. During this time of year, the selling or giving of Tikoy, especially by Chinese Filipinos, is widely known and practised in the country. Celebrations are centered primarily in Binondo in Manila, the oldest ever Chinatown in the world, with other celebrations in key cities.\nIn Indonesia, the Chinese New Year is officially named Tahun Baru Imlek (Chinese: \u9670\u66c6\u65b0\u5e74; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: im-le\u030dk sin-n\u00ee), with \"Imlek\" deriving from the Hokkien word for \"Lunar Calendar\" (Chinese: \u9670\u66c6; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: im-le\u030dk).[123][124] It is known locally in Hokkien as Sin Cia (Chinese: \u65b0\u6b63; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: sin-chia\u207f).[125] It was celebrated as one of the official national religious holiday by Chinese Indonesians since 18 June 1946 to 1 January 1953 through government regulation signed by President Sukarno on 18 June 1946.[126] It was unofficially celebrated by ethnic Chinese from 1953 to 1967 based on government regulation signed by Vice-President Muhammad Hatta on 5 February 1953 which annul the previous regulation, among others, the Chinese New Year as a national religious holiday.[127]\nEffectively from 6 December 1967,[128] until 1998, the spiritual practice to celebrate the Chinese New Year by Chinese families was restricted specifically only inside of the Chinese house. This restriction is made by the New Order government through a Presidential Instruction No. 14 of 1967 signed by President Suharto. This restriction is ended when the regime has changed and the President Suharto was overthrown. The celebration was conducted unofficially by Chinese community from 1999 to 2000.\nOn 17 January 2000, the President Abdurrahman Wahid issued Presidential Decree No. 6 of 2000 to annul the previous instruction.[129] On 19 January 2001, the Ministry of Religious Affairs issued Minsterial Decree No.13 of 2001 on Imlek Day as a National Holiday to set Hari Tahun Baru Imlek as a \"facultative holiday\" for Chinese community.[130] Through the Presidential Decree it was officially declared as a 1 (one) day public religious holiday as of 9 April 2002 by President Megawati.[124] The Indonesian government authorize only the first day of the Chinese New Year as a public religious holiday and it is specifically designated only for Chinese people.[123][124][126][127][131]\nIn Indonesia, the first day of the Chinese New Year is recognized as a part of the celebration of the Chinese religion and tradition of Chinese community.[123][124][126][127][130] There are no other official or unofficial of the Chinese New Year as a public holiday. The remaining 14 days are celebrated only by ethnic Chinese families.[132] In Indonesia, the Chinese Year is named as a year of K\u01d2ngz\u01d0 (Chinese: \u5b54\u5b50) or Kongzili in Indonesian. Every year, the Ministry of Religious Affairs set the specific date of religious holiday based on input from religious leaders.[132] The Chinese New Year is the only national religious holiday in Indonesia that was enacted specifically with the Presidential Decree, in this case with the Presidential Decree No. 19 of 2002 dated on 9 April 2002.[123][124] The celebration of the Chinese New Year as a religious holiday is specifically intended only for Chinese people in Indonesia (tradisi masyarakat Cina yang dirayakan secara turun temurun di berbagai wilayah di Indonesia,[124]dan umat Agama Tionghoa[126]) and it is not intended to be celebrated by native Indonesians.[123][124][126][127][128][130]\nObserved by Thai Chinese and parts of the private sector, the festival is usually celebrated for three days, starting on the day before Chinese New Year's Eve. Chinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, Satun[60] and Songkhla[136] Provinces. For the year 2021 (one year only) the government declared Chinese New Year a government holiday. It applies mostly to civil servants, financial institutions and private businesses can decide whether or not to observe it.[137]\nDivided into 3 days, the first day is the Wan chai (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e08\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22; pay day), meaning the day that people go out to shop for offerings, the second day is the Wan wai (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e49; worship day), is a day of worshiping the gods and ancestral spirits, which is divided into three periods: dawn, late morning and afternoon, the third day is a Wan tieow (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e27; holiday), is a holiday where everyone will leave the house to travel or to bless relatives or respectable people, often wearing red clothes which is believed to bring auspiciousness to life.[138]\nWith one of the largest Chinese populations outside of Asia, Sydney also claims to have the largest Chinese New Year Celebrations outside of Asia with over 600,000 people attending the celebrations in Chinatown annually. The events there span over three weeks including the launch celebration, outdoor markets, evening street food stalls, Chinese top opera performances, dragon boat races, a film festival and multiple parades that incorporate Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese people. More than 100,000 people attend notably the main parade with over 3,500 performers.[142] The festival also attracts international media coverage, reaching millions of viewers in Asia.[143] The festival in Sydney is organized in partnership with a different Chinese province each year. Apart from Sydney, other state capital cities in Australia also celebrate Chinese New Year due to large number of Chinese residents.[144] The cities include: Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne Box Hill and Perth. The common activities are lion dance, dragon dance, New Year market, and food festival. In the Melbourne suburb of Footscray, Victoria a Lunar New Year celebration initially focusing on the Vietnamese New Year has expanded into a celebration of the Chinese New Year as well as the April New Year celebrations of the Thais, Cambodians, Laotians and other Asian Australian communities who celebrate the New Year in either January/February or April.[145]\nMultiple groups in New York City cooperate to sponsor a week-long Lunar New Year celebration. The festivities include cultural festival,[148] music concert,[156] fireworks on the Hudson River near the Chinese Consulate,[157] and special exhibits.[156] One of the key celebrations is the Chinese New Year parade[158] with floats and fireworks taking place along the streets in Chinatown, Manhattan, the largest Chinese New Year parade outside Asia.[159] In June 2015, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that the Lunar New Year would be made a public school holiday.[160]\nThe festival incorporates Grant and Kearny Streets into its street festival and parade route, respectively. The use of these streets traces its lineage back to early parades beginning the custom in San Francisco. In 1849, with the discovery of gold and the ensuing California Gold Rush, over 50,000 people had come to San Francisco to seek their fortune or just a better way of life. Among those were many Chinese, who had come to work in the gold mines and on the railroad. By the 1860s, the residents of San Francisco's Chinatown were eager to share their culture with their fellow San Francisco residents who may have been unfamiliar with (or hostile towards) it. The organizers chose to showcase their culture by using a favourite American tradition \u2013 the parade. They invited a variety of other groups from the city to participate, and they marched down what today are Grant Avenue and Kearny Street carrying colourful flags, banners, lanterns, drums, and firecrackers to drive away evil spirits.\nIn San Francisco, over 100 units participate in the annual Chinese New Year Parade held since 1958.[162] The parade is attended by some 500,000 people along with another 3 million TV viewers.[163]\nThe Golden Dragon Parade has happened annually in Chinatown Los Angeles since 1899, one of the oldest and largest Chinese New Year parades outside of Asia. Beginning in the 1970s, famous Asian American actors have held the title of Grand Marshall of the parade, the first being Bruce Lee.[164]\nAround Southern California many communities also put on festivals and parades that can last multiple days, with some of the largest occurring in the San Gabriel Valley, home to the largest Chinese community outside of Asia and often called the first suburban Chinatown, and Little Saigon where many Vietnamese and Chinese live. Monterey Park puts on the largest of such festivals, occupying 5 blocks in the city and attracting over 100,000 individuals.[165] Neighboring Alhambra also has hosted a large festival since 1993 with many performances and street vendors.[166]San Gabriel hosts an annual Chinese Gala at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse in addition to its street festival.[167]\nMany people also celebrate by going to temples across Southern California, and the largest temple celebration is held at Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights.[170] Most major shopping malls will also decorate for Chinese New Year.[171]\nDisneyland California Adventure in Anaheim celebrates Chinese New Year by decorating certain areas of the park in Chinese displays, serving speciality East Asian foods and allowing for character photos with Mulan, Mushu, Raya, Tigger and Mickey and Minnie Mouse in Chinese Costumes.[172]\nIn London, celebrations take place in Chinatown, Leicester Square, and Trafalgar Square. Festivities include a parade, cultural feast, fireworks, concerts, and performances.[173] The celebration attracts between 300,000 and 500,000 people yearly according to the organisers.[174]\nIn Paris, celebrations have been held since the 1980s in several districts during one month with many performances[175] and the main of the three parades with 40 groups and 4,000 performers is attended alone by more than 200,000 people in the 13th arrondissement.[176][177]\nIn Pakistan, the Chinese New Year is also celebrated among the sizeable Chinese expatriate community that lives in the country. During the festival, the Chinese embassy in Islamabad arranges various cultural events in which Pakistani arts and cultural organizations and members of the civil society also participate.[182][183][184][185]\nChinese culture in Mauritius is an important component of the multiculturalism in Mauritius.[186] Despite the small size of the Sino-Mauritian community (estimated to be only about 3% of the total population),[187] Chinese New Year (also known as Chinese Spring Festival) is a time where Chinese culture is celebrated on the island[188] and is a public holiday in Mauritius.[189] Mauritius is also the only country in Africa which lists the Chinese Spring Festival as a statutory public holiday.[186] During this period of the year, there is a joyful and festive atmosphere throughout the entire country.[186]\nSino-Mauritians are very attached to Chinese traditions.[190] The Chinese Spring Festival is the biggest celebration for the Sino-Mauritians on the island.[190] The dates of the celebration follows the Chinese lunar calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar.[190] During the week prior to the New Year's Day, spring cleaning in homes is performed.The festival starts on Chinese New Year's Eve by lighting on firecrackers to ward off evil spirits.[191]: 71 Traditionalist visit pagodas to offer offerings and prayers on the New Year's Eve.[191]: 71 Following Chinese customs, there is a big family dinner on the New Year's Eve.[190][192] While the family dinner was traditionally celebrated at the house of the oldest family parents, going to restaurants for New Year's Eve is getting more popular; some restaurants may also have special dinners across the island to foster the family reunions of Sino-Mauritians.[190] After the New year's Eve dinner, youths often go to nightclubs.[190] On the day of the Chinese New Year, it is customary for Sino-Mauritian to share niangao to their relatives and friends and to lit firecrackers to ward off evil spirits.[189][190] Red envelopes are also given. Some families would also visit pagoda on New Year to honour their ancestors.[190] Some families observe a vegetarian diet on the New Year.[192] The main celebration events typically take place in the Chinatown area in Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius.[189][193] The Dragon dance and the Southern Lion dance is also customary on that day.[190][192] The colour red is predominantly used to decorate the streets and houses. Chinese items (e.g. Chinese lanterns) are also used as decorations.[193]\nThe Chinese New Year is often accompanied by loud, enthusiastic greetings, often referred to as \u5409\u7965\u8a71 (j\u00edxi\u00e1nghu\u00e0) in Mandarin or \u5409\u5229\u8aaa\u8a71 (Kat Lei Seut Wa) in Cantonese, loosely translated as auspicious words or phrases. New Year couplets printed in gold letters on bright red paper, referred to as chunlian (\u6625\u806f) or fai chun (\u63ee\u6625), is another way of expressing auspicious new year wishes. They probably predate the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), but did not become widespread until then.[194] Today, they are ubiquitous with Chinese New Year.\nSome of the most common greetings include:\nXin nian kuai le / San nin fai lok: simplified Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u4e50; traditional Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u6a02; pinyin: X\u012bnni\u00e1nku\u00e0il\u00e8; Jyutping: san1 nin4 faai3 lok6; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Sin-n\u00ee kh\u00f2ai-lo\u030dk; Hakka: Sin Ngen Kai Lok; Taishanese: Slin Nen Fai Lok. A more contemporary greeting reflective of Western influences, it literally translates from the greeting \"Happy new year\" more common in the west. It is written in English as \"xin nian kuai le\".[195] In northern parts of China, traditionally people say simplified Chinese: \u8fc7\u5e74\u597d; traditional Chinese: \u904e\u5e74\u597d; pinyin: Gu\u00f2ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo instead of simplified Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u4e50; traditional Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u6a02 (X\u012bnni\u00e1nku\u00e0ile), to differentiate it from the international new year. And \u904e\u5e74\u597d (Gu\u00f2ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo) can be used from the first day to the fifth day of Chinese New Year. However, \u904e\u5e74\u597d (Gu\u00f2ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo) is considered very short and therefore somewhat discourteous. Gong Hei Fat Choi at Lee Theatre Plaza, Hong Kong\nGong xi fa cai / Gong hei fat choi: simplified Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22; traditional Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1; pinyin: G\u014dngx\u01d0f\u0101c\u00e1i; Hokkien: Kiong hee huat chai (POJ: Kiong-h\u00ed hoat-ch\u00e2i); Cantonese: Gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4; Hakka: Gung hee fatt choi, which loosely translates to \"Congratulations and be prosperous\". It is spelled varyingly in English, such as \"Gung hay fat choy\",[196] \"gong hey fat choi\",[195] or \"Kung Hei Fat Choy\".[197] It is often mistakenly assumed to be synonymous with \"Happy New Year\". The saying is now commonly heard in English speaking communities for greetings during Chinese New Year in parts of the world where there is a sizable Chinese-speaking community, including overseas Chinese communities that have been resident for several generations, relatively recent immigrants from Greater China, and those who are transit migrants (particularly students).\nNumerous other greetings exist, some of which may be exclaimed out loud to no one in particular in specific situations. For example, as breaking objects during the new year is considered inauspicious, one may then say \u6b72\u6b72\u5e73\u5b89 (Su\u00ecsu\u00ec-p\u00edng'\u0101n) immediately, which means \"everlasting peace year after year\". Su\u00ec (\u6b72), meaning \"age\" is homophonous with \u788e (su\u00ec) (meaning \"shatter\"), in the demonstration of the Chinese love for wordplay in auspicious phrases. Similarly, \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918 (ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa), a wish for surpluses and bountiful harvests every year, plays on the word y\u00fa that can also refer to \u9b5a (y\u00fa meaning fish), making it a catch phrase for fish-based Chinese new year dishes and for paintings or graphics of fish that are hung on walls or presented as gifts.\nThe most common auspicious greetings and sayings consist of four characters, such as the following:\nThese greetings or phrases may also be used just before children receive their red packets, when gifts are exchanged, when visiting temples, or even when tossing the shredded ingredients of yusheng particularly popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Children and their parents can also pray in the temple, in hopes of getting good blessings for the new year to come.\nChildren and teenagers sometimes jokingly use the phrase \"\u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff0c\u7d05\u5305\u62ff\u4f86\" (pinyin: g\u014dngx\u01d0f\u0101c\u00e1i, h\u00f3ngb\u0101o n\u00e1l\u00e1i; Cantonese: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86; Jyutping: gung1hei2 faat3coi4, lei6 si6 dau6 loi4), roughly translated as \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope!\". In Hakka the saying is more commonly said as 'Gung hee fatt choi, hung bao diu loi' which would be written as \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff0c\u7d05\u5305\u9017\u4f86 \u2013 a mixture of the Cantonese and Mandarin variants of the saying.\nBack in the 1960s, children in Hong Kong used to say \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff0c\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86\uff0c\u6597\u96f6\u5514\u611b (Cantonese, Gung Hei Fat Choy, Lai Si Tau Loi, Tau Ling M Ngoi), which was recorded in the pop song Kowloon Hong Kong by Reynettes in 1966. Later in the 1970s, children in Hong Kong used the saying: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff0c\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86\uff0c\u4f0d\u6beb\u5acc\u5c11\uff0c\u58f9\u868a\u5514\u611b, roughly translated as, \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope, fifty cents is too little, don't want a dollar either.\" It basically meant that they disliked small change \u2013 coins which were called \"hard substance\" (Cantonese: \u786c\u5622). Instead, they wanted \"soft substance\" (Cantonese: \u8edf\u5622), which was either a ten dollar or a twenty dollar note.\n^\"The Lunar New Year: Rituals and Legends\". Asia for Educators, Columbia University. On New Year's Day and for the next several days, people still follow the custom of exchanging visits \u2014 with close relatives first, then with distant relatives and friends. Traditionally, the order of these visits also began with the eldest, and the first day was usually devoted to paternal family relatives.\n^\"Love of Chinese Language Expressed in Couplets\". The earliest known couplet was written at Spring Festival 964 by the King of Later Shu. It said: \"The New Year is bathed in forefathers' blessings; the joyous festival promises everlasting youth and wealth.\"\n^Magida, Lenore (18 December 1994). \"What's Doing in Hong Kong\". The New York Times. Retrieved 5 February 2019. In such an environment, it seems fitting that the traditional New Year's greeting is, in Cantonese, 'Kung Hei Fat Choy' \u2013 which means 'Wishing You Success and Prosperity.'",
