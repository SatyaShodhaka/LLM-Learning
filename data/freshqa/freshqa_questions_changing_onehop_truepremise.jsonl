        "context": "\nFounded in 1541 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, Santiago has served as the capital city of Chile since colonial times.[4] The city has a downtown core of 19th-century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets featuring a mix of art deco, neo-gothic, and other styles. Santiago's cityscape is defined by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River, which is lined by parks such as Parque Forestal and Balmaceda Park. The Andes Mountains can be seen from most parts of the city and contribute to a smog problem, particularly during winter, due to the lack of rain. The outskirts of the city are surrounded by vineyards, and Santiago is within an hour's drive of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean.\nSantiago is the political and financial center of Chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations. The Chilean government's executive and judiciary branches are based in Santiago, while the Congress mostly meets in nearby Valpara\u00edso.\nWhen the term \"Santiago\" is used without additional clarification, it typically refers to Greater Santiago (Gran Santiago), the metropolitan area defined by its continuous urban development. This area encompasses the Commune of Santiago and over 40 other communes, making up the majority of the Santiago Province and parts of neighboring provinces (see Political divisions). The definition of the metropolitan area has changed over time as a result of the city's expansion and the incorporation of smaller cities and rural areas.\nThe name \"Santiago\" was chosen by the Spanish conqueror Pedro de Valdivia, when he founded the city in 1541, as a tribute to James the Great, the patron saint of Spain. The name of this saint is rendered differently in Spanish, such as Diego, Jaime, Jacobo or Santiago, with the latter being derived from the Galician evolution of Vulgar LatinSanctu Iacobu. There was no indigenous name for the area where Santiago is located, but the Mapuche language uses the adapted name \"Santiaw.\"\nWhen Valdivia founded the city, he named it \"Santiago del Nuevo Extremo\" or \"Nueva Extremadura,\" in reference to the territory he intended to colonize and his home region of Extremadura. The name was eventually replaced, and to differentiate it from other cities called Santiago, the South American city is sometimes referred to as \"Santiago de Chile\" in Spanish and other languages.\nThe residents of the city and region are referred to as santiaguinos (male) and santiaguinas (female).\nArchaeological evidence suggests that the first human groups arrived in the Santiago basin around the 10th millennium BC. These groups were primarily nomadic hunter-gatherers who traveled from the coast to the interior to hunt guanacos during the Andean snowmelt. By around 800 AD, the first permanent settlers established themselves in the area, forming agricultural communities along the Mapocho River. They cultivated crops such as maize, potatoes, and beans and domesticated camelids.\nThe villages belonging to the Picunches (as referred to by Chileans) or Promaucae people (as referred to by the Incas) were subject to the Inca Empire from the late 15th century to the early 16th century. The Incas established a settlement in the valley of mitimas, located in the center of present-day Santiago, with fortifications such as Huaca de Chena and the El Plomo hill sanctuary. It is believed that the area served as a base for failed Inca expeditions southward and was a junction along the Inca Trail.\n1541 founding of Santiago.

Royal Library, Denmark.[6]\nPedro de Valdivia, a conquistador from Extremadura who was sent by Francisco Pizarro from Peru, arrived in the Mapocho valley on 13 December 1540, after a long journey from Cuzco. Valdivia and his party camped by the river in the slopes of the Tupahue hill and gradually began to interact with the Picunche people who lived in the area. Valdivia later called a meeting with the local chiefs and explained to them his plan to establish a city on behalf of King Carlos I of Spain. The city would serve as the capital of his governorship of Nueva Extremadura. The local chiefs accepted Valdivia's proposal and even suggested that the city be founded on a small island between two branches of the river near a small hill named Huel\u00e9n.\nOn 12 February 1541, Valdivia officially founded the city of Santiago del Nuevo Extremo (Santiago of New Extremadura) near Huel\u00e9n, which he renamed Santa Lucia. He tasked the city's layout to master builder Pedro de Gamboa, who created a grid design for the city. In the center of the city, Gamboa designed a Plaza Mayor, which served as the central hub for the town. Plots for the cathedral and the governor's house were also selected around the plaza. The city was divided into eight blocks from north to south and ten blocks from east to west, with each quarter-block or \"solar\" being given to the settlers. The settlers then built homes made of mud and straw.\nValdivia left for the south with his troops months later, starting the War of Arauco. Santiago was left vulnerable and the indigenous group of Michimalonco took advantage, attacking the young city. On 11 September 1541, the city was destroyed by the natives, but a Spanish Garrison of 55 soldiers managed to defend the fort. The defense was led by In\u00e9s de Su\u00e1rez, who was a companion to Valdivia. When she realized they were being overpowered, she ordered the execution of all indigenous prisoners and displayed their heads on pikes, throwing a few towards the attackers. In response to this brutal act, the indigenous group dispersed in fear. The city was gradually rebuilt, with the newly established city of Concepci\u00f3n becoming prominent, where the Royal Audiencia of Chile was established in 1565. However, the ongoing threat posed by the War of Arauco and frequent earthquakes prevented the establishment of the Royal Court in Santiago until 1607, solidifying the city's status as the capital.\nDuring the early years of the city, the Spanish suffered from severe shortages of food and other supplies. The local indigenous Picunche had adopted a strategy of halting cultivation and retreating to more remote locations,[7] which isolated the Spanish and forced them to resort to eating whatever they could find. The shortage of clothing meant that some Spanish had to dress with hides from dogs, cats, sea lions, and foxes.[7]\nMap of colonial Santiago at the beginning of the 18th century.The Calicanto bridge over the Mapocho river was the main symbol of the city of Santiago after its inauguration in 1779.\nAlthough Santiago was facing the threat of permanent destruction early on, due to attacks from indigenous peoples, earthquakes, and floods, the city began to grow rapidly. Out of the 126 blocks designed by Pedro de Gamboa in 1558, 40 were occupied. In 1580, the first major buildings in the city started to be erected, marked by the placement of the foundation stone of the first Cathedral in 1561 and the building of the church of San Francisco in 1572. Both of these structures were primarily made of adobe and stone. In addition to the construction of significant buildings, the city began to thrive as the surrounding areas welcomed tens of thousands of livestock.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the growth of the city was hindered by a series of disasters including an earthquake, a smallpox epidemic in 1575, the Mapocho River floods in 1590, 1608, and 1618, and a devastating earthquake on 13 May 1647 which resulted in the death of over 600 people and affected over 5,000 others. Despite these setbacks, the capital of the Captaincy General of Chile continued to grow, with all the power of the country being centered on the Plaza de Armas in Santiago.\nIn 1767, the corregidor Luis Manuel de Za\u00f1artu launched one of the most significant architectural projects of the colonial period, the Calicanto Bridge, connecting the city to La Chimba on the north side of the Mapocho River. He also began constructing embankments to prevent river overflows. Although the bridge was completed, its piers were frequently damaged by the river. In 1780, Governor Agust\u00edn de J\u00e1uregui hired the Italian architect Joaqu\u00edn Toesca, who designed several important buildings, including the cathedral's fa\u00e7ade, the Palacio de La Moneda, the San Carlos Canal, and the completion of the embankments during the government of Ambrosio O'Higgins. These works were officially opened in 1798. The O'Higgins government also opened the road to Valpara\u00edso in 1791, connecting the capital with the country's main port.\nWith the end of the war, Bernardo O'Higgins was accepted as Supreme Director and, like his father, began a number of important works for the city. During the \"Patria Nueva\" era, closed institutions reopened. The General Cemetery opened, work on the canal San Carlos was completed, and in the south arm of the Mapocho River, known as La Ca\u00f1ada, the drying riverbed which had been used as a landfill for some time, was transformed into an avenue, now known as the Alameda de las Delicias.\nTwo earthquakes struck the city in the 19th century, one on November 19, 1822, and another on February 20, 1835. Despite these disasters, the city continued to grow rapidly. In 1820, the population was recorded as 46,000, but by 1854, it had risen to 69,018. By 1865, the census reported 115,337 residents. This significant increase was due to suburban expansion to the south and west of the capital, as well as the growth of the bustling district of La Chimba, which resulted from the division of old properties in the area. This new peripheral development marked the end of the previous checkerboard structure that dominated the city center.\nDuring the Republican era, several institutions were founded, including the University of Chile, the Normal School of Preceptors, the School of Arts and Crafts, and the Quinta Normal. The latter comprised the Museum of Fine Arts (now the Museum of Science and Technology) and the National Museum of Natural History. These institutions were established primarily for educational purposes, but also served as examples of public planning during that period. In 1851, the first telegraph system connecting the capital to the Port of Valpara\u00edso was inaugurated.[8]\nDuring the \"Liberal Republic\" and the administration of Mayor Benjam\u00edn Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, a new phase in the urban development of the capital was initiated. One of the main projects during this period was the remodeling of Cerro Santa Luc\u00eda, which had fallen into disrepair despite its central location.[8] In his effort to transform Santiago, Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna initiated the construction of the Camino de Cintura, a road surrounding the entire city. The redevelopment of Alameda Avenue also took place during this time, turning it into the city's main road.\nAlso during this era, O'Higgins Park was established with the help of European landscapers in 1873. The public park, known for its large gardens, lakes, and carriage trails, became a landmark in Santiago. Other notable structures were also opened during this period, including the Teatro Municipal opera house and the Club H\u00edpico de Santiago. In addition, the 1875 International Exposition was held in the Quinta Normal grounds.[9]\nSantiago emerged as the central hub of the national railway system. On 14 September 1857, the first railway arrived in the city and terminated at the Santiago Estaci\u00f3n Central railway station, which was under construction at the time and officially opened in 1884. During this period, rail lines connected Santiago to Valpara\u00edso and regions in northern and southern Chile. The streets of Santiago were also paved, and by 1875, there were 1,107 railway cars in the city, while 45,000 people used trams daily.\nThe Jesuit Church of Santiago in 1857, by Charles Barbant and Son for Le Monde Illustr\u00e9.The Plaza de Armas in 1906.\nAs the new century began, Santiago underwent various changes due to the rapid growth of industry. Valpara\u00edso, which had previously been the economic center of the country, gradually lost its prominence to the capital. By 1895, 75% of the national manufacturing industry was located in Santiago, while only 28% was in Valpara\u00edso. By 1910, major banks and shops had established themselves in the central streets of Santiago, further diminishing the role of Valpara\u00edso.\nThe enactment of the Autonomous Municipalities Act empowered municipalities to establish various administrative divisions within the Santiago department, with the goal of enhancing local governance. In 1891, the municipalities of Maip\u00fa, \u00d1u\u00f1oa, Renca, Lampa, and Colina were created, followed by Providencia and Barrancas in 1897, and Las Condes in 1901. The La Victoria departmento was also divided, leading to the creation of Lo Ca\u00f1as in 1891, which was then further split into La Granja and Puente Alto in 1892, followed by La Florida in 1899, and La Cisterna in 1925.\nThe San Cristobal Hill underwent a prolonged process of development during this period. In 1903, an astronomical observatory was established on the hill, and the following year, construction began on a 14-meter statue of the Virgin Mary. Today, the statue is visible from various points in the city. However, the shrine was not completed until several decades later.\nThe 1910 Chile Centennial celebrations marked the beginning of several urban development projects. The railway network was expanded, connecting the city and its growing suburbs with a new ring and route to Caj\u00f3n del Maipo. A new railway station was also built in the north of the city: the Mapocho Station. The Parque Forestal was established on the southern side of the Mapocho river, and new buildings such as the Museum of Fine Arts, the Barros Arana public boarding school, and the National Library were opened. In addition, a sewer system was installed, serving approximately 85% of the city's population.\nThe 1920 census estimated the population of Santiago to be 507,296 inhabitants, equivalent to 13.6% of the total population of Chile. This represented a growth of 52.5% from the 1907 census, an annual increase of 3.3%, which was almost three times the national average. This growth was mainly due to an influx of farmers from the southern regions who came to work in the factories and railroads that were being built. However, this growth was concentrated in the suburbs and not in the city center.\nDuring this time, the downtown district consolidated as a commercial, financial, and administrative center, with the establishment of various shops and businesses around Ahumada Street and a Civic District in the vicinity of the Palace of La Moneda. The latter project involved the construction of modernist buildings for the offices of the ministries and other public services, as well as the start of the construction of medium-rise buildings. Meanwhile, the traditional residents of the center began to migrate to more rural areas like Providencia and \u00d1u\u00f1oa, which attracted the oligarchy and European immigrant professionals, and San Miguel for middle-class families. Additionally, in the periphery, villas were built by various organizations of the time. Modernity also spread in the city, with the introduction of the first theaters, the expansion of the telephone network, and the opening of Los Cerrillos Airport in 1928, among other advancements.\nWomen prepare soup kitchens in 1932.\nThe perception that the early 20th century was a time of economic prosperity due to technological advancements was in stark contrast to the living conditions of lower social classes. The previous decades of growth resulted in an unprecedented population boom starting in 1929, but was met with tragedy as the Great Depression hit. The collapse of the nitrate industry in the north left 60,000 people unemployed, compounded by a decline in agricultural exports, resulting in an estimated 300,000 unemployed people nationwide. Desperate for survival, many migrants flocked to Santiago and its thriving industry. However, they often found themselves struggling to find housing, with many being forced to live on the streets. The harsh living conditions resulted in widespread diseases like tuberculosis, and took a toll on the homeless population. At the same time, unemployment rates and living costs skyrocketed, while the salaries of the people in Santiago fell.\nThe situation would change several years later with a new industrial boom fostered by CORFO and the expansion of the state apparatus from the late 1930s. At this time, the aristocracy lost much of its power, and the middle class, composed of merchants, bureaucrats, and professionals, acquired the role of setting national policy. In this context, Santiago began to develop a substantial middle- and lower-class population, while the upper classes sought refuge in the districts of the capital. Thus, the old moneyed class, who previously frequented Cousi\u00f1o and Alameda Park, lost their hegemony over popular entertainment venues, and the National Stadium emerged in 1938.\nIn the following decades, Santiago continued to grow at an unprecedented rate. In 1940, the city had a population of 952,075 residents, which increased to 1,350,409 by 1952, and reached 1,907,378 in the 1960 census. This growth was reflected in the urbanization of rural areas on the outskirts of the city, where middle and lower-class families with stable housing were established. In 1930, the urban area covered 6,500 hectares, which increased to 20,900 in 1960 and to 38,296 in 1980. Although growth was mainly concentrated in communities such as Barrancas to the west, Conchal\u00ed to the north, and La Cisterna and La Granja to the south, the center of the city lost population, leaving more space for commercial, banking, and government development. The upper class, on the other hand, began to settle in the foothills of Las Condes and the La Reina sector.\nThe regulation of growth in Santiago only began in the 1960s with the creation of various development plans for Greater Santiago, a concept that reflected the city's new reality as a much larger urban center. In 1958, the Intercommunal Plan of Santiago was released, which proposed a limit of 38,600 urban and semi-urban hectares for a maximum population of 3,260,000 residents. The plan also included plans for the construction of new avenues, such as the Am\u00e9rico Vespucio Avenue and Panamericana Route 5, as well as the expansion of 'industrial belts'. The 1962 World Cup provided a new impetus for city improvement efforts, and in 1966, the Santiago Metropolitan Park was established on Cerro San Crist\u00f3bal. The Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (MINVU) also began to eradicate shantytowns and build new homes. Finally, the Edificio Diego Portales was constructed in 1972.\nExtension of Greater Santiago, in 1965.\nIn 1967, the new Pudahuel International Airport was opened, and after years of discussion, construction of the Santiago Metro began in 1969. The first phase of the Metro, which ran beneath the western section of Alameda, was opened in 1975 and soon became one of the most prestigious buildings in the city. Over the following years, the Metro continued to expand, with two perpendicular lines in place by the end of 1978. Building telecommunications infrastructure was also an important development of this period, as reflected in the construction of the Torre Entel, which, since its construction in 1975, has become one of the symbols of the capital and remained the tallest structure in the country for two decades.\nAfter the military coup of 1973 and the establishment of the military regime, significant changes in urban planning did not occur until the 1980s when the government embraced a neoliberal economic model. In 1979, the master plan was revised, expanding the urban area to over 62,000 hectares for real estate development. This led to urban sprawl, particularly in La Florida, causing the city to reach 40,619 hectares in size in the early 1990s. According to the 1992 census, Santiago became the country's most populous municipality, with 328,881 residents. Tragically, a powerful earthquake struck the city on March 3, 1985, causing minimal casualties but leaving many homeless and destroying numerous historic buildings.\nWith the onset of the transition to democracy in 1990, the city of Santiago surpassed four million inhabitants, with the majority residing in the south, particularly in La Florida, which was the most populous area, followed by Puente Alto and Maip\u00fa. The real estate development in these municipalities, as well as in others such as Quilicura and Pe\u00f1alol\u00e9n, was largely driven by the construction of housing projects for middle-class families. Meanwhile, high-income families relocated to the foothills, now referred to as Barrio Alto, boosting the population of Las Condes and giving rise to new communes, including Vitacura and Lo Barnechea.\nThe area around Providencia Avenue became an important commercial hub in the eastern sector. This development extended to the Barrio Alto, which became an attractive location for the construction of high-rise buildings. Major companies and financial corporations established themselves in the area, giving rise to a thriving modern business center known as Sanhattan. The departure of these companies to Barrio Alto and the construction of shopping centers all around the city created a crisis in the city center. To reinvigorate the area, the government transformed the main shopping streets into pedestrian walkways, such as Paseo Ahumada, and offered tax benefits for the construction of residential buildings, which attracted young adults.\nThe city faced a series of problems due to disorganized growth. During the winter months, air pollution reached critical levels and a layer of smog blanketed the city. In response, the authorities implemented legislative measures to reduce industrial pollution and placed restrictions on vehicle use. To address the problem of transportation, the metro system underwent significant expansion, with lines being extended and three new lines added between 1997 and 2006 in the southeastern sector. In 2011, a new extension was inaugurated in Maip\u00fa, bringing the total length of the metropolitan railway to 105 km. In the early 1990s, the bus system also underwent a major reform. In 2007, the master plan known as Transantiago was established, although it has faced various challenges since its implementation\nEntering the 21st century, rapid development continued in Santiago. The Civic District was revitalized with the creation of the Plaza de la Ciudadan\u00eda and the construction of the Ciudad Parque Bicentenario, which marked the bicentenary of the Republic. The trend of constructing tall buildings continued in the eastern sector, which was highlighted by the opening of the Titanium La Portada and Gran Torre Santiago skyscrapers in the Costanera Center complex.\nOn 27 February 2010, a powerful earthquake hit the capital city of Santiago, causing damage to some older buildings and rendering some modern structures uninhabitable. This sparked a heated discussion about the actual implementation of mandatory earthquake standards in the city's modern architecture.\nDespite urban integration efforts, socioeconomic inequality and geosocial fragmentation remain two of the most important problems, both in the city and in the country. These problems have been considered one of the factors that led to the \"Estallido Social\", a series of massive protests and severe riots carried out between 2019 and 2020. The protests led to a serious civil confrontation, which led to thousands of arrests and accusations of human rights violations. Meanwhile, the demonstrations registered serious episodes of violence against public and private infrastructure, with the Santiago Metro being one of the most affected by these episodes: more than half of its stations registered damage (several being partially set on fire) and only eleven months later the network returned to normal service.\nThe city lies in the center of the Santiago Basin, a large bowl-shaped valley consisting of broad and fertile lands surrounded by mountains. The city has a varying elevation, gradually increasing from 400 m (1,312 ft) in the western areas to more than 700 m (2,297 ft) in the eastern areas. Santiago's international airport, in the west, lies at an altitude of 460 m (1,509 ft). Plaza Baquedano, near the center, lies at 570 m (1,870 ft). Estadio San Carlos de Apoquindo, at the eastern edge of the city, has an elevation of 960 m (3,150 ft).\nThe city is flanked by the main chain of the Andes to the east and the Chilean Coastal Range to the west. On the north, it is bordered by the Cord\u00f3n de Chacabuco, a mountain range of the Andes. At the southern border lies the Angostura de Paine, an elongated spur of the Andes that almost reaches the coast.\nThe mountain range immediately bordering the city on the east is known as the Sierra de Ram\u00f3n, which was formed due to tectonic activity of the San Ram\u00f3n Fault. This range reaches 3296 meters at Cerro de Ram\u00f3n. The Sierra de Ram\u00f3n represents the \"Precordillera\" of the Andes. 20 km (12 mi) further east is the even larger Cordillera of the Andes, which has mountains and volcanoes that exceed 6,000 m (19,690 ft) and on which some glaciers are present. The tallest is the Tupungato mountain at 6,570 m (21,555 ft). Other mountains include Tupungatito, San Jos\u00e9, and Maipo. Cerro El Plomo is the highest mountain visible from Santiago's urban area.\nDuring recent decades, urban growth has outgrown the boundaries of the city, expanding to the east up the slopes of the Andean Precordillera. In areas such as La Dehesa, Lo Curro, and El Arrayan, urban development is present at over 1,000 meters of altitude.[11]\nSantiago has a cool semi-arid climate (BSk according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with Mediterranean (Csb) patterns: warm dry summers (October to March) with temperatures reaching up to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) on the hottest days; winters (April to September) are cool with cool to cold mornings; typical daily maximum temperatures of 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F), and low temperatures near 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). In climate station of Quinta Normal (near downtown) the precipitation average is 286.3 mm, and in climate station of Tobalaba (in higher grounds near the Andes mountains) the precipitation average is 326.1 mm.\nIn the airport area of Pudahuel, mean rainfall is 276.9 mm (10.90 in) per year, about 80% of which occurs during the winter months (May to September), varying between 50 and 80 mm (1.97 and 3.15 in) of rainfall during these months. That amount contrasts with a very sunny season during the summer months between December and March, when rainfall does not exceed 4 mm (0.16 in) on average, caused by an anticyclonic dominance continued for about seven or eight months. There is significant variation within the city, with rainfall at the lower-elevation Pudahuel site near the airport being about 20 percent lower than at the older Quinta Normal site near the city center.\nSantiago's rainfall is highly variable and heavily influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation cycle, with rainy years coinciding with El Ni\u00f1o events and dry years with La Ni\u00f1a events.[13] The wettest year since records began in 1866 was 1900 with 819.7 millimeters (32.27 in)[14] \u2013 part of a \"pluvial\" from 1898 to 1905 that saw an average of 559.3 millimeters (22.02 in) over eight years[15] incorporating the second wettest year in 1899 with 773.3 millimeters (30.44 in) \u2013 and the driest 1924 with 66.1 millimeters (2.60 in).[14] Typically there are lengthy dry spells even in the rainiest of winters,[13] intercepted with similarly lengthy periods of heavy rainfall. For instance, in 1987, the fourth wettest year on record with 712.1 millimeters (28.04 in), there was only 1.7 millimeters (0.07 in) in the 36 days between 3 June and 8 July,[16][17] followed by 537.2 millimeters (21.15 in) in the 38 days between 9 July and 15 August.[18]\nPrecipitation is usually only rain, as snowfall only occurs in the Andes and Precordillera, being rare in eastern districts, and extremely rare in most of the city.[19] In winter, the snow line is about 2,100 meters (6,890 ft), and it ranges from 1,500\u20132,900 meters (4,921\u20139,514 ft).[19]\nThe city is affected only occasionally by snowfall. The period between 2000 and 2017 has been registered 9 snowfalls and only two have been measured in the central sector (2007 and 2017). The amount of snow registered in Santiago on 15 July 2017 ranged between 3.0 cm in Quinta Normal and 10.0 cm in La Reina (Tobalaba).[20]\nTemperatures vary throughout the year from an average of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in January to 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) in June and July. In the summer days are very warm to hot, often reaching over 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) and a record high close to 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F),[21] while nights are very pleasant and cool, at 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F). During autumn and winter the temperature drops, and is slightly lower than 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F). The temperature may even drop to 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), especially during the morning. The historic low of \u22126.8 \u00b0C (20 \u00b0F) was in July 1976.[22]\nSantiago's location within a watershed is one of the most important factors determining the climate of the city. The coastal mountain range serves as a screen that stops the spread of maritime influence, contributing to the increase in annual and daily thermal oscillation (the difference between the maximum and minimum daily temperatures can reach 14 \u00b0C) and maintaining low relative humidity, close to an annual average of 70%. It also prevents the entry of air masses, with the exception of some coastal low clouds that penetrate to the basin through the river valleys.[23]\nPrevailing winds are from the southwest, with an average of 15 km/h (9 mph), especially during the summer; the winter is less windy.\nIn response to the destructive earthquakes of 1960 (Valdivia) and 1985 (Algarrobo), Santiago implemented strict building codes to minimize damage from future earthquakes. In 2010, Chile was hit by the sixth largest recorded earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale. The earthquake caused the death of 525 people, 13 of whom were in Santiago, and resulted in an estimated cost of 15\u201330 billion US dollars. Although many homes were damaged, the stricter building codes prevented the scale of destruction seen in the Haiti earthquake of the same year, in which over 100,000 people lost their lives.[33] While large earthquakes pose a threat, smaller earthquakes from local faults in and around Santiago are also a significant risk.[34] In particular, the San Ram\u00f3n and El Array\u00e1n faults in the east and north of the city are considered to be particularly dangerous.[34][35]\nThe eastern neighborhoods of Santiago are also susceptible to landslides, especially of the debris flow type, which pose a significant hazard to the area.[36]\nSantiago has a serious air pollution problem.[37] Despite a decrease in air pollution in the 1990s, the level of pollution has not significantly improved since 2000. In fact, a study conducted by a Chilean university in 2010 showed that the pollution levels in Santiago had doubled since 2002.[38] Particulate matter air pollution, specifically PM2.5 and PM10, frequently exceeds the standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization, posing a significant threat to public health.[39]\nOne of the major sources of air pollution in Santiago is the El Teniente copper mine smelter, which operates year-round.[40][41] The government typically does not classify it as a local pollution source, as it is located just outside the reporting area of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, 110 kilometers from downtown.[42][43]\nDuring the winter months, thermal inversion can trap and concentrate smog and air pollution in the Central Valley.\nSantiago has made progress in treating its wastewater, with the Mapocho Wastewater Treatment Plant starting operations in March 2012. This increased the city's wastewater treatment capacity to 100%, making Santiago the first capital city in Latin America to treat all of its municipal sewage.\nPanoramic view of northeastern Santiago, as seen from the hills of Parque Metropolitano in Providencia. Visible in the background are Apoquindo and Sierra de Ram\u00f3n.\nStray dogs are a common sight in Santiago,[44][45] but the country as a whole has a low incidence of rabies.[46]\nAccording to data collected in the 2002 census by the National Institute of Statistics, the Santiago metropolitan area population reached 5,428,590 inhabitants, equivalent to 35.9% of the national total and 89.6% of total regional inhabitants. This figure reflects broad growth in the population of the city during the 20th century: it had 383,587 inhabitants in 1907; 1,010,102 in 1940; 2,009,118 in 1960; 3,899,619 in 1982; and 4,729,118 in 1992.[47] (percentage of total population, 2007)[48]\nPopulation of Santiago from 1820 to 2020 (projected).\nThe growth of Santiago has undergone several changes over the course of its history. In its early years, the city had a rate of growth 2.9% annually until the 17th century, then down to less than 2% per year until the early 20th century figures. During the 20th century, Santiago experienced a demographic explosion as it absorbed migration from mining camps in northern Chile during the economic crisis of the 1930s. The population surged again via migration from rural sectors between 1940 and 1960. This migration was coupled with high fertility rates, and annual growth reached 4.9% between 1952 and 1960. Growth has declined, reaching 1.4% in the early 2000s. The size of the city expanded constantly; The 20,000 hectares Santiago covered in 1960 doubled by 1980, reaching 64,140 hectares in 2002. The population density in Santiago is 8,464 inhabitants/km2.\nThe population of Santiago[47] has seen a steady increase in recent years. In 1990 the total population under 20 years was 38.0% and 8.9% were over 60. Estimates in 2007 show that 32.9% of men and 30.7% of women were less than 20 years old, while 10.2% of men and 13.4% of women were over 60 years. For the year 2020, it is estimated that the figures will be 26.7% and 16.8%.\n4,313,719 people in Chile say they were born in one of the communes of the Santiago Metropolitan Region,[47] which, according to the 2002 census, amounts to 28.5% of the national total. 67.6% of the inhabitants of Santiago claim to have been born in one of the communes of the metropolitan area. In communes such as Santiago Centro and Independencia, according to 2017 census, 1/3 of residents is a Latin American immigrant (28% and 31% of the population of these communes, respectively).[49] Other communes of Greater Santiago with high numbers of immigrants are Estaci\u00f3n Central (17%) and Recoleta (16%).[50]\nSantiago is the industrial and financial center of Chile, and generates 45% of the country's GDP.[51] Some international institutions, such as ECLAC (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean), have their offices in Santiago. The strong economy and low government debt is attracting migrants from Europe and the United States.[52]\nSantiago's steady economic growth over the past few decades has transformed it into a modern metropolis. The city is now home to a growing theater and restaurant scene, extensive suburban development, dozens of shopping centers, and a rising skyline, including the second tallest building in Latin America, the Gran Torre Santiago. It includes several major universities, and has developed a modern transportation infrastructure, including a free flow toll-based, partly underground urban freeway system and the Metro de Santiago, South America's most extensive subway system.\nSantiago is an economically divided city (Gini coefficient of 0.47).[53][54] The western half (zona poniente) of the city is, on average, much poorer than the eastern communes, where the high-standard public and private facilities are concentrated.\nPanoramic view of the Costanera Center and the city, with the Andes Mountains in the distance.\nThe Costanera Center, a mega project in Santiago's Financial District, includes a 280,000-square-meter (3,000,000 sq ft) mall, a 300-meter (980 ft) tower, two office towers of 170 meters (558 ft) each, and a hotel 105 meters (344 ft) tall. In January 2009 the retailer in charge, Cencosud, said in a statement that the construction of the mega-mall would gradually be reduced until financial uncertainty is cleared.[55] In January 2010, Cencosud announced the restart of the project, and this was taken generally as a symbol of the country's success over the global financial crisis. Close to Costanera Center another skyscraper is already in use, Titanium La Portada, 190 meters (623 ft) tall. Although these are the two biggest projects, there are many other office buildings under construction in Santiago, as well as hundreds of high rise residential buildings. In February 2011, Gran Torre Santiago, part of the Costanera Center project, located in the called Sanhattan district, reached the 300-meter mark, officially becoming the tallest structure in Latin America.[56]\nPeldehue airport in Colina began operations on December 13, 2021. It will be able to service up to 25 flights per hour.[58]\nSantiago is also served by Eulogio S\u00e1nchez Airport (ICAO: SCTB), a small, privately owned general aviation airport in the commune of La Reina.\nBus companies provide passenger transportation from Santiago to most areas of the country as well as to foreign destinations, while some also provide parcel shipping and delivery services.\nThere are several bus terminals in Santiago:\nTerminal San Borja: located in Metro station \"Estaci\u00f3n Central.\" Provides buses to all destinations in Chile and to some towns around Santiago.\nTerminal Alameda: located in Metro station \"Universidad de Santiago.\" Provides buses to all destinations in Chile.\nTerminal Santiago: located one block west of Terminal Alameda. Provides buses to all destinations in Chile as well as to destinations in most countries in South America, except Bolivia.\nTerrapuerto Los H\u00e9roes: located two blocks east of Metro station \"Los H\u00e9roes.\" Provides buses to south of Chile and some northern cities, as well as Argentina (Mendoza and Buenos Aires) and Paraguay (Asunci\u00f3n).\nTerminal La Paz: located about two blocks away from the fresh fruit and vegetables market \"Vega Central;\" the closest Metro station is \"Puente Cal y Canto.\" It connects the rural areas north of Santiago.\nA network of free flow toll highways connects the various areas of the city. They include the Vespucio Norte and Vespucio Sur highways, which surround the city completing a nearly full circle; Autopista Central, the section of the Pan American highway crossing the city from north to south, divided in two highways 3 km (2 mi) apart; and the Costanera Norte, running next to the Mapocho River and connecting the international airport with the downtown and with the wealthier areas of the city to the east, where it divides into two highways.\nOther non-free flow toll roads connecting Santiago to other cities, include: Rutas del Pac\u00edfico (Ruta 68), the continuation of the Alameda Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Avenue to the west, provides direct access to Valpara\u00edso and Vi\u00f1a del Mar; Autopista del Sol (Ruta 78), connects Melipilla and the port of San Antonio with the capital; Autopista Ruta del Maipo (a.k.a. \"Acceso Sur\") is an alternative to the Pan American highway to access the various localities south of Santiago; Autopista Los Libertadores provides access to the main border crossing to Argentina, via Colina and Los Andes; and Autopista Nororiente, which provides access to the suburban development known as Chicureo, north of the capital.\nSantiago has 37% of Chile's vehicles, with a total of 991,838 vehicles, 979,346 of which are motorized. An extensive network of streets and avenues stretching across Santiago facilitate travel between the different communities that make up the metropolitan area.\nIn the 1990s the government attempted to reorganize the public transport system. New routes were introduced in 1994 and the buses were painted yellow. The system, however, had serious issues with routes overlapping, high levels of air and noise pollution, and safety problems for both riders and drivers. To tackle these issues a new transport system, called Transantiago, was devised. The system was launched in earnest on 10 February 2007, combining core services across the city with the subway and with local feeder routes, under a unified system of payment through a contactless smartcard called \"Tarjeta bip!\" The change was not well received by users, who complained of lack of buses, too many bus-to-bus transfers, and diminished coverage. Some of these problems were resolved, but the system earned a bad reputation which it has not been able to shake off. As of 2011[update], the fare evasion rate is stubbornly high.\nIn 2019, the government introduced the new public transport system named RED.\nIn recent years many cycle paths have been constructed, but so far the number is limited and with little connections between the routes. Most cyclists ride on the street, and the use of helmets and lights is not widespread, even though it is mandatory.\nSantiago Metro has seven operating lines (1, 2, 3, 4, 4A, 5 and 6), extending over 146 km (91 mi) and connecting 139 stations. The system carries around 2,400,000 passengers per day. Two underground lines (Line 4 and 4A) and an extension of Line 2 were inaugurated in 2005 and 2006, while an extension of Line 5 was inaugurated in 2011.[60][61] Line 6 was inaugurated in 2017, adding 10 stations to the network and approximately 15 km (9 mi) of track. Line 3 opened on January 22, 2019, with 18 new stations [62][61]\nEFE provides suburban rail service under the brandname of Metrotren. There are 2 southbound routes. The most popular is the Metrotren Nos service, between the Central Station of Santiago and Nos station, in San Bernardo. This line, inaugurated in 2017, serves 8 million people per year, with 12 trains serving 10 stations with a frequency of 6 minutes during rush hours, and 12 during the rest of the time. The other route is the Metrotren Rancagua service, between the Central Station of Santiago and the Rancagua station, connecting Santiago with the regional capital of O'Higgins.\nRed Metropolitana de Movilidad electric bus, using current color scheme.Transantiago bus, with original color scheme (2005\u20132012)\nRed (formerly known as Transantiago) is the name of Santiago's comprehensive public transportation system. It operates by integrating local feeder bus lines, main bus lines, EFE commuter trains, and the metro network. The system features an integrated fare system that enables passengers to make transfers between bus, metro, and train services using a single, contactless smartcard known as \"Bip!\". Additionally, it offers reduced fares for senior citizens, high school students, and university students.\nTaxicabs are prevalent in Santiago and are easily recognizable by their black bodies and yellow roofs, as well as their orange license plates. Another type of taxi called radiotaxis can be ordered by phone and can come in any make, model, or color, but must always have the orange license plates. Colectivos are shared taxis that follow a specific route and charge a fixed fee for the ride.\nCabify, Uber and DiDi are also available in Santiago, though authorities warn they currently operate outside the law.[63]\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Santiago - to and from work, for example - on a weekday is 84 min. 23% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 15 min, while 21% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7.4 km, while 15% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.[64]\nAs of 2006, Santiago was home to 992,000 vehicles, 979,000 of which were motorized. This made up 37.3% of Chile's total vehicle count. 805,000 cars passed through the city, which is 37.6% of the national total[clarification needed] or one car for every seven people.[65]\nDuring the 2000s, several urban highways were built through Santiago in order to improve the situation for vehicles. The road General Vel\u00e1squez and sections of the Pan-American Highway in Santiago were converted into the Autopista Central, while Am\u00e9rico Vespucio became variously the highways Vespucio Norte Express and Vespucio Sur, as well as Vespucio Oriente in the future. Following the edge of the Mapocho River, Costanera Norte was built to link the northeast of the capital to the airport and the downtown area. All these highways, totaling 210 km in length, have a free flow toll system.\nGreater Santiago lacks a metropolitan government for its administration, which is distributed between authorities, complicating the operation of the city as a single entity.[66] The highest authorities in Santiago are considered to be the governor of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, who is popularly elected to the office, now held by Claudio Orrego, and the regional presidential delegate of Santiago Metropolitan Region, an official appointed by the president of Chile, post currently occupied by Constanza Mart\u00ednez.\nThe conurbation of Greater Santiago does not fit perfectly into any administrative division, as it extends into four different provinces and 35 communes plus 11 satellite communes which together make the Santiago Metropolitan Area. The majority of its 641.4 km2 (247.65 sq mi) (as of 2002)[67] lie within Santiago Province, with some peripheral areas contained in the provinces of Cordillera, Maipo, and Talagante.\nOnly a few historical buildings from the Spanish colonial period remain in the city, because \u2013 like the rest of the country \u2013 Santiago is regularly hit by earthquakes. Extant buildings include the Casa Colorada (1769), the San Francisco Church (1586), and Posada del Corregidor (1750).\nThe cathedral on the central square (Plaza de Armas) is a sight that ranks as high as the Palacio de La Moneda, the Presidential Palace. The original building was built between 1784 and 1805, and architect Joaqu\u00edn Toesca was in charge of its construction. Other buildings surrounding the Plaza de Armas are the Central Post Office Building, which was finished in 1882, and the Palacio de la Real Audiencia de Santiago, built between 1804 and 1807. It houses the Chilean National History Museum, with 12,000 objects that can be exhibited. On the southeast corner of the square stands the green cast-iron Commercial Edwards building, which was built in 1893. East of that is the colonial building of the Casa Colorada (1769), which houses the Museum of Santiago. Close by is the Municipal Theatre of Santiago, which was built in 1857 by the French architect Brunet of Edward Baines. It was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1906. Not far from the theater is the Subercaseaux Mansion and the National Library, one of the largest libraries of South America.\nThe Former National Congress Building, the Justice Palace, and the Royal Customs Palace (Palacio de la Real Aduana de Santiago) are located close to each other. The latter houses the Museum of pre-Columbian art. A fire destroyed the building of the Congress in 1895, which was then rebuilt in a neoclassical style and reopened in 1901. The Congress was deposed under the military dictatorship (1973\u201389) of Augusto Pinochet, and after the dictatorship was newly constituted on 11 March 1990, in Valpara\u00edso.\nThe building of the Justice Palace (Palacio de Tribunales) is located on the south side of the Montt Square. It was designed by the architect Emilio Doy\u00e9re and built between 1907 and 1926. The building is home to the Supreme Court of Chile. The panel of 21 judges is the highest judicial power in Chile. The building is also the headquarters of the Court of Appeals of Santiago.\nBandera street leads toward the building of the Santiago Stock Exchange (the Bolsa de Comercio), completed in 1917, the Club de la Uni\u00f3n (opened in 1925), the Universidad de Chile (1872), and toward the oldest churchhouse in the city, the San Francisco Church (constructed between 1586 and 1628), with its Marian statue of the Virgen del Socorro (\"Our Lady of Help\"), which was brought to Chile by Pedro de Valdivia. North of the Plaza de Armas (\"Square of Arms\", where the colonial militia was mustered) are the Paseo Puente, the Santo Domingo Church (1771), and the Central Market (Mercado Central), an ornamental iron building. Also in downtown Santiago is the Torre Entel, a 127.4-meter-high television tower with observation deck completed in 1974; the tower serves as a communication center for the communications company, ENTEL Chile.\nThe Costanera Center was completed in 2009, and includes housing, shopping, and entertainment venues. The project, with a total area of 600,000 square meters, includes the 300-meter high Gran Torre Santiago (South America's tallest building) and other commercial buildings. The four office towers are served by highway and subway connections.[68]\nIn Santiago's major theater companies are located, hosting several national and international projects, with the highest expression during the International Theatre Festival known as Santiago a Mil, which takes place every January since 1994 and has gathered more than one million spectators. Also is the Planetarium at the University of Santiago de Chile.\nThere are 18 cinemas in the capital with a total of 144 rooms and over 32,000 seats, the projection centers than 5 arthouse add.\nFor children and teenagers, there are several entertainment venues, such as amusement park Fantasilandia, the National Zoo or the Buin Zoo on the outskirts of the city. The Bellavista, Brasil, Manuel Montt, Plaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa and Suecia account for most of the nightclubs, restaurants and bars in the city, the main evening entertainment centers in the capital. In order to promote the economic development of other regions, the law prohibits the construction of a casino in the metropolitan region, but nearby are the casino from the coastal city of Vina del Mar, 120 km from distance from Santiago, and Monticello Grand Casino in Mostazal, 56 kilometers south of Santiago, which opened in 2008.\nIn other parts of the city there are some museums such as the Aeronautical Museum in Cerrillos, Museum of Tajamares in Providence and the Museo Interactivo Mirador in La Granja. The latter opened in 2000 and designed mainly for children and youth has been visited by more than 2.8 million visitors, making it the busiest museum in the country.\nThe most important public library is the National Library located in downtown Santiago. Its origins date back to 1813, when it was created by the nascent Republic and was moved to its current premises a century later, also home to the headquarters of the National Archives. In order to provide more closeness to the population, incorporating new technologies and complement the services provided by public libraries and the National Library was opened in 2005 the Library of Santiago at Barrio Matucana.\nOrquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Chile (\"Chile Symphony Orchestra\"), part of the Universidad de Chile, performs in its theater.\nThere are a number of jazz establishments, some of them, including \"El Perseguidor\", \"Thelonious\", and \"Le Fournil Jazz Club\", are located in Bellavista, one of Santiago's \"hippest\" neighborhoods, though \"Club de Jazz de Santiago\", the oldest and most traditional one, is in \u00d1u\u00f1oa.[69] Annual festivals featured in Santiago include Lollapalooza and the Maquinaria festival.\nSantiago is home to some of Chile's most successful football clubs. Colo-Colo, founded on 19 April 1925, has a long tradition, and has played continuously in the highest league since the establishment of the first Chilean league in 1933. The club's wins include 30 national titles, 10 Copa Chile successes, and champions of the Copa Libertadores tournament in 1991, the only Chilean team to have won this tournament. The club hosts its home games in the Estadio Monumental in the commune of Macul.\nUniversidad de Chile has 18 national titles and 5 Copa Chile wins. In 2011 they were champions of Copa Sudamericana, the only Chilean team to have won this tournament. The club was founded on 24 May 1927, under the name Club Deportivo Universitario as a union of Club N\u00e1utico and Federaci\u00f3n Universitaria. The founders were students of the University of Chile. In 1980, the organization separated from the University of Chile and the club is now completely independent. The team plays its home games in the Estadio Nacional de Chile in the commune of \u00d1u\u00f1oa.\nClub Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica (UC) was founded on 21 April 1937. It consists of fourteen different departments. This team plays its home games in Estadio San Carlos de Apoquindo. Universidad Cat\u00f3lica has 13 national titles, making it the third most successful football club in the country. It has played the Copa Libertadores more than 20 times, reaching the final in 1993, losing to S\u00e3o Paulo FC.\nThe city held a round of the all-electric FIA Formula E Championship on 3 February 2018, on a temporary street circuit incorporating the Plaza Baquedano and Parque Forestal.[71] It was the first FIA sanctioned race in the country.\nThere is an extensive network of bicycle trails in the city, especially in the Providencia commune. The longest section is the Americo Vespuccio road, which contains a very wide dirt path with many trees through the center of a street used by motorists on both sides. The next longest path is along the Mapocho River along Andr\u00e9s Bello Avenue. Many people use folding bicycles to commute to work.[73]\nAs in most of Chile, the majority of the population of Santiago is Catholic. According to the National Census, carried out in 2002 by the National Statistics Bureau (INE), in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, 3,129,249 people 15 and older identified themselves as Catholics, equivalent to 68.7% of the total population, while 595,173 (13.1%) described themselves as Evangelical Protestants. Around 1.2% of the population declared themselves as being Jehovah's Witnesses, while 2.0% identified themselves as Latter-day Saints (Mormons), 0.3% as Jewish, 0.1% as Eastern Orthodox and 0.1% as Muslim. Approximately 10.4% of the population of the Metropolitan Region stated that they were atheist or agnostic, while 5.4% declared that they followed other religions.[74]\nIn 2010 construction was initiated on the Santiago Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Temple, serving as the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship for South America, in the commune of Pe\u00f1alolen.[75] Construction at the site was completed and the temple was dedicated in October 2016.[76]\nThe city is home to numerous universities, colleges, research institutions, and libraries.\nThe largest university and one of the oldest in the Americas is Universidad de Chile. The roots of the university date back to the year 1622, as on 19 August the first university in Chile under the name of Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino was founded. On 28 July 1738, it was named the Real Universidad de San Felipe in honor of King Philip V of Spain. In the vernacular, it is also known as Casa de Bello (Spanish: House of Bello \u2013 after their first Rector, Andr\u00e9s Bello). On 17 April 1839, after Chile's independence from the Kingdom of Spain, it was renamed the Universidad de Chile, and reopened on 17 September 1843.[77]",

It\u2019s no secret that DiCaprio is quite the ladies\u2019 man, having shared relationships with so many models, it\u2019s hard to keep up at this point \u2014 but fans have noticed that these romances never tend to last very long.\nIt\u2019s almost as if DiCaprio has a new model by his side every year or so. On top of that, the California native had once said he didn\u2019t believe in marriage and didn\u2019t see himself having children before changing his tune in the late \u201800s, saying he did, in fact, believe in marriage.\nSo what\u2019s been stopping the Hollywood veteran from settling down and becoming a dad? Here\u2019s the lowdown\u2026\nAt the start of his career, DiCaprio was very vocal in saying that he couldn\u2019t see himself getting married to someone because he simply didn\u2019t believe in the union.\nMany people assumed that because he was still fairly young at the time he made those comments, DiCaprio just hadn\u2019t put much thought on settling down in the near future, particularly as his career was just beginning to skyrocket.\nHe shared the same views on having children, prompting many to wonder why DiCaprio had such a negative stance on both topics.\nBut in 2008, during an interview with Parade, the Wolf of Wall Street actor said he was contradicting himself after admitting that he did finally want to get married and have children, which was quite the contrast from what he\u2019d said in the past.\n\u201cI want to get married and have children. In saying that, I realize I am contradicting everything I\u2019ve said before,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cI absolutely believe in marriage.\u201d\nAt the time, DiCaprio was dating Israeli model Bar Refaeli, who had been with for two years. They remained a couple before calling it quits in 2011, which was when the wealthy movie star began dating a string of models.\nIn 2010, DiCaprio did another interview with Germany\u2019s OK Magazine, where he said he was too busy to settle down and have kids, which heavily implied that his career still stood at the forefront above other things such as becoming a dad or a husband.\nDuring the candid chat, DiCaprio insisted he had yet to reach his full potential as an actor, despite having already helmed some of the most iconic film roles at the time.\nWhen asked about perhaps becoming a dad in the near future, he responded, saying: \"I'm not that old, my biological clock isn't ticking yet.\n\"I'd like to leave it to fate if and when I'm going to be a father. A part of me has too many professional plans to even seriously consider it. When I see the children in my family though, the idea of having children doesn't seem too far-fetched.\u201d\nHe concluded: \"In this business nothing is as dangerous and as feared as loneliness.

The concept of a Martian as something living on Mars is part of the fiction.\nThe minimum distance between the orbits of Mars and Earth from 2014 to 2061, measured in astronomical units\nThe energy needed for transfer between planetary orbits, or delta-v, is lowest at intervals fixed by the synodic period. For Earth\u2013Mars trips, the period is every 26 months (2 years, 2 months), so missions are typically planned to coincide with one of these launch periods. Due to the eccentricity of Mars's orbit, the energy needed in the low-energy periods varies on roughly a 15-year cycle[4] with the easiest periods needing only half the energy of the peaks.[5] In the 20th century, a minimum existed in the 1969 and 1971 launch periods and another low in 1986 and 1988, then the cycle repeated.[4] The next low-energy launch period occurs in 2033.[6]\nSeveral types of mission plans have been proposed, including opposition class and conjunction class,[5] or the Crocco flyby.[7] The lowest energy transfer to Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit, which would involve a roughly 9-month travel time from Earth to Mars, about 500 days (16 mo) at Mars to wait for the transfer window to Earth, and a travel time of about 9 months to return to Earth.[8][9] This would be a 34-month trip.\nShorter Mars mission plans have round-trip flight times of 400 to 450 days,[10] or under 15 months, but would require significantly higher energy. A fast Mars mission of 245 days (8.0 months) round trip could be possible with on-orbit staging.[11] In 2014, ballistic capture was proposed, which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the Hohmann.[12]\nIn the Crocco grand tour, a crewed spacecraft would get a flyby of Mars and Venus in under a year in space.[13] Some flyby mission architectures can also be extended to include a style of Mars landing with a flyby excursion lander spacecraft.[14] Proposed by R. Titus in 1966, it involved a short-stay lander-ascent vehicle that would separate from a \"parent\" Earth-Mars transfer craft prior to its flyby of Mars. The Ascent-Descent lander would arrive sooner and either go into orbit around Mars or land, and, depending on the design, offer perhaps 10\u201330 days before it needed to launch itself back to the main transfer vehicle.[14] (See also Mars flyby.)\nIn the 1980s, it was suggested that aerobraking at Mars could reduce the mass required for a human Mars mission lifting off from Earth by as much as half.[15] As a result, Mars missions have designed interplanetary spacecraft and landers capable of aerobraking.[15]\nA number of uncrewed spacecraft have landed on the surface of Mars, while some, such as the Schiaparelli EDM (2016), have failed what is considered a difficult landing. The Beagle2 failed in 2003. Among the successes:\nWhen an expedition reaches Mars, braking is required to enter orbit. Two options are available: rockets or aerocapture. Aerocapture at Mars for human missions was studied in the 20th century.[16] In a review of 93 Mars studies, 24 used aerocapture for Mars or Earth return.[16] One of the considerations for using aerocapture on crewed missions is a limit on the maximum force experienced by the astronauts. The current scientific consensus is that 5 g, or five times Earth gravity, is the maximum allowable deceleration.[16]\nConducting a safe landing requires knowledge of the properties of the atmosphere, first observed by Mariner 4, and a survey of the planet to identify suitable landing sites. Major global surveys were conducted by Mariner 9 and Viking 1 and two orbiters, which supported the Viking landers. Later orbiters, such as Mars Global Surveyor, 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have mapped Mars in higher resolution with improved instruments. These later surveys have identified the probable locations of water, a critical resource.[17]\nA primary limiting factor for sending humans to Mars is funding. In 2010, the estimated cost was roughly US$500 billion, though the actual costs are likely to be more.[18] Starting in the late 1950s, the early phase of space exploration was conducted as much to make a political statement as to make observations of the solar system. However, this proved to be both wasteful and unsustainable, and the current climate is one of international cooperation, with large projects such as the International Space Station and the proposed Lunar Gateway being built and launched by multiple countries.[citation needed]\nCritics argue that the immediate benefits of establishing a human presence on Mars are outweighed by the immense cost, and that funds could be better redirected towards other programs, such as robotic exploration. Proponents of human space exploration contend that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation. There are also claims that a long-term investment in space travel is necessary for humanity's survival.[18]\nOne factor reducing the funding needed to place a human presence on Mars may be space tourism. As the space tourism market grows and technological developments are made, the cost of sending humans to other planets will likely decrease accordingly. A similar concept can be examined in the history of personal computers: when computers were used only for scientific research, with minor use in big industry, they were big, rare, heavy, and costly. When the potential market increased and they started to become common in many homes (in Western and developed countries) for the purpose of entertainment such as computer games, and booking travel/leisure tickets, the computing power of home devices skyrocketed and prices plummeted.[19]\nComparison of radiation doses \u2013 includes the amount detected on the trip from Earth to Mars by the RAD inside the MSL (2011\u20132013).[20][21][22] Vertical axis is in logarithmic scale, so the dose over a Mars year is about 15 times the DOE limit, not less than twice, as a quick glance might suggest. The actual dose would depend on factors such as spacecraft design and natural events such as solar flares.\nPsychological effects of isolation from Earth and, by extension, the lack of community due to lack of a real-time connection with Earth (Compare Hermit)\nSocial effects of several humans living under cramped conditions for more than one Earth year, and possibly two or three years, depending on spacecraft and mission design\nLack of medical facilities\nPotential failure of propulsion or life-support equipment\nSome of these issues were estimated statistically in the HUMEX study.[36]\nEhlmann and others have reviewed political and economic concerns, as well as technological and biological feasibility aspects.[37] While fuel for roundtrip travel could be a challenge, methane and oxygen can be produced using Martian H2O (preferably as water ice instead of liquid water) and atmospheric CO2 with mature technology.[38]\nRobotic spacecraft to Mars are currently required to be sterilized. The allowable limit is 300,000 spores on the exterior of general craft, with stricter requirements for\nspacecraft bound for \"special regions\" containing water.[39][40] Otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life-detection experiments but possibly the planet itself.[41]\nSterilizing human missions to this level is impossible, as humans are host to typically a hundred trillion (1014) microorganisms of thousands of species of the human microbiota, and these cannot be removed. Containment seems the only option, but it is a major challenge in the event of a hard landing (i.e. crash).[42] There have been several planetary workshops on this issue, but with no final guidelines for a way forward yet.[43] Human explorers would also be vulnerable to back contamination to Earth if they become carriers of microorganisms.[44]\nA number of nations and organizations have long-term intentions to send humans to Mars.\nThe United States has several robotic missions currently exploring Mars, with a sample-return planned for the future. The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) is intended to serve as the launch/splashdown crew delivery vehicle, with a Deep Space Habitat module providing additional living-space for the 16-month-long journey. The first crewed Mars Mission, which would include sending astronauts to Mars, orbiting Mars, and a return to Earth, is proposed for the 2030s.[1][45][46][47] Technology development for US government missions to Mars is underway, but there is no well-funded approach to bring the conceptual project to completion with human landings on Mars by the mid-2030s, the stated objective.[48] NASA-funded engineers are studying a way to build potential human habitats there by producing bricks from pressurized Martian soil.[49]\nThe ESA has a long-term goal to send humans, but has not yet built a crewed spacecraft. It has sent robotic probes such as ExoMars in 2016 and planned to send the next probe in 2022, but the project was suspended due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[50] It is now looking to send the probe in 2028 with assistance from NASA.[51]\nDepiction of plants growing in a Mars base. NASA plans to grow plants for space food.[53]NASA has stated that robots will prepare an underground base for a human surface mission.[54]\nSignificant technological hurdles need to be overcome for human spaceflight to Mars.\nEntry into the thin and shallow Martian atmosphere will pose significant difficulties with re-entry; compared to Earth's much denser atmosphere, any spacecraft will descend very rapidly to the surface and must be slowed down.[55] A heat shield has to be utilized.[56] NASA is carrying out research on retropropulsive deceleration technologies to develop new approaches to Mars atmospheric entry. A key problem with propulsive techniques is handling the fluid flow problems and attitude control of the descent vehicle during the supersonic retropropulsion phase of the entry and deceleration.[57]\nA return mission from Mars will need to land a rocket to carry crew off the surface. Launch requirements mean that this rocket could be significantly smaller than an Earth-to-orbit rocket. Mars-to-orbit launch can also be achieved in single stage. Despite this, landing an ascent rocket on Mars will be difficult.[citation needed]\nOne of the medical supplies that might be needed is a considerable mass of intravenous fluid, which is mainly water, but contains other substances so it can be added directly to the human blood stream. If it could be created on the spot from existing water, this would reduce mass requirements. A prototype for this capability was tested on the International Space Station in 2010.[59]\nAdvanced resistive exercise device\nA person who is inactive for an extended period of time loses strength and muscle and bone mass. Spaceflight conditions are known to cause loss of bone mineral density in astronauts, increasing bone fracture risk. Last mathematical models predict 33% of astronauts will be at risk for osteoporosis during a human mission to Mars.[30] A resistive exercise device similar to ARED would be needed in the spaceship.\nBreathing gases\nWhile humans can breathe pure oxygen, usually additional gases such as nitrogen are included in the breathing mix. One possibility is to take in situnitrogen and argon from the atmosphere of Mars, but they are hard to separate from each other.[60] As a result, a Mars habitat may use 40% argon, 40% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen.[60]\nAn idea for keeping carbon dioxide out of the breathing air is to use reusable amine-bead carbon dioxide scrubbers.[61] While one carbon dioxide scrubber filters the astronaut's air, the other is vented to the Mars atmosphere.[61]\nMany Mars mission concepts propose precursor missions to the moons of Mars, for example a sample return mission to the Mars moon Phobos[62] \u2013 not quite Mars, but perhaps a convenient stepping stone to an eventual Martian surface mission. Lockheed Martin, as part of their \"Stepping stones to Mars\" project, called the \"Red Rocks Project\", proposed to explore Mars robotically from Deimos.[63][64][65]\nUse of fuel produced from water resources on Phobos or Deimos has also been proposed.\nAn uncrewed Mars sample return mission (MSR) has sometimes been considered as a precursor to crewed missions to Mars's surface.[66] In 2008, the ESA called a sample return \"essential\" and said it could bridge the gap between robotic and human missions to Mars.[66] An example of a Mars sample return mission is Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars.[67] Mars sample return was the highest priority Flagship Mission proposed for NASA by the Planetary Decadal Survey 2013\u20132022: The Future of Planetary Science.[68] However, such missions have been hampered by complexity and expense, with one ESA proposal involving no fewer than five different uncrewed spacecraft.[69]\nSample return plans raise the concern, however remote, that an infectious agent could be brought to Earth.[69] Regardless, a basic set of guidelines for extraterrestrial sample return has been laid out depending on the source of sample (e.g. asteroid, Moon, Mars surface, etc.)[70]\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, NASA crafted four potential pathways to Mars human missions,[71] of which three included a Mars sample return as a prerequisite to human landing.[71]\nThe rover Perseverance, which landed on Mars in 2021, is equipped with a device that allows it to collect rock samples to be returned at a later date by another mission.[72] Perseverance as part of the Mars 2020 mission was launched on top of an Atlas V rocket on 30 July 2020.[73]\n^ abDavid S.

        "context": "\nThe University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in Oakland, where it absorbed the assets of the College of California before moving to Berkeley in 1873.[12][13] It also affiliated with independent medical and law schools in San Francisco. Over the next eight decades, several branch locations and satellite programs were established across the state. In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus in Berkeley, with UC President Robert Gordon Sproul staying in place as chief executive of the UC system, while Clark Kerr became Berkeley's first chancellor[14][15][16][17] and Raymond B. Allen became the first chancellor of UCLA.[18] However, the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies,[19] and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as UC president that UC was able to evolve into a university system from 1957 to 1960.[20] At that time, chancellors were appointed for additional campuses and each was granted some degree of greater autonomy.[21]\nIn November 1857, the college's trustees began to acquire various parcels of land facing the Golden Gate in what is now Berkeley for a future planned campus to the north of Oakland.[23] But first, they needed to secure the college's water rights by buying a large farm to the east.[23] In 1864, they organized the College Homestead Association, which borrowed $35,000 to purchase the land, plus another $33,000 to purchase 160 acres (650,000 m2) of land to the south of the future campus.[25] The association subdivided the latter parcel and started selling lots with the hope it could raise enough money to repay its lenders and also create a new college town.[23] But sales of new homesteads fell short.[23]\nGovernor Frederick Low favored the establishment of a state university based upon the University of Michigan plan, and thus in one sense may be regarded as the founder of the University of California.[23][24] At the College of California's 1867 commencement exercises, where Low was present, Yale University professor Benjamin Silliman Jr. criticized the 1866 California law for establishing a polytechnic school, instead of a real university.[23][24] That same day, Low reportedly first suggested a merger of the already-functional College of California (which had land, buildings, faculty, and students, but not enough money) with the nonfunctional state college (which had money and nothing else), and went on to participate in the ensuing negotiations.[23][24]\nOn October 9, 1867, the college's trustees reluctantly agreed to join forces with the state college to their mutual advantage, but under one condition\u2014that there not be simply an \"Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College\", but a complete university, within which the assets of the College of California would be used to create a College of Letters (now known as the College of Letters and Science).[23][24][26] Accordingly, the Organic Act, establishing the University of California, was introduced as a bill by AssemblymanJohn W. Dwinelle on March 5, 1868, and after it was duly passed by both houses of the state legislature, it was signed into state law by Governor Henry H. Haight (Low's successor) on March 23, 1868.[23][24][27] However, as legally constituted, the new university was not an actual merger of the two colleges, but was an entirely new institution which merely inherited certain objectives and assets from each of them.[28] The University of California's second president, Daniel Coit Gilman, opened its new campus in Berkeley in September 1873.[29]\nSection 8 of the Organic Act authorized the Board of Regents to affiliate the University of California with independent self-sustaining professional colleges.[30][31] \"Affiliation\" meant UC and its affiliates would \"share the risk in launching new endeavors in education\".[30] The affiliates shared the prestige of the state university's brand, and UC agreed to award degrees in its own name to their graduates on the recommendation of their respective faculties, but the affiliates were otherwise managed independently by their own boards of trustees, charged their own tuition and fees, and maintained their own budgets separate from the UC budget.[30] It was through the process of affiliation that UC was able to claim it had medical and law schools in San Francisco within a decade of its founding.[30]\nIn 1879, California adopted its second and current constitution, which included unusually strong language to ensure UC's independence from the rest of the state government.[10][32] This had lasting consequences for the Hastings College of the Law, which had been separately chartered and affiliated in 1878 by an act of the state legislature at the behest of founder Serranus Clinton Hastings.[33] After a falling out with his own handpicked board of directors, the founder persuaded the state legislature in 1883 and 1885 to pass new laws to place his law school under the direct control of the Board of Regents.[34] In 1886, the Supreme Court of California declared those newer acts to be unconstitutional because the clause protecting UC's independence in the 1879 state constitution had stripped the state legislature of the ability to amend the 1878 act.[35][36] To this day, the Hastings College of the Law remains an affiliate of UC, maintains its own board of directors, and is not governed by the regents.[30][35]\nHart Hall, built in 1928, is the oldest building on the UC Davis campus.\nIn contrast, Toland Medical College (founded in 1864 and affiliated in 1873) and later, the dental, pharmacy, and nursing schools in San Francisco were affiliated with UC through written agreements, and not statutes invested with constitutional importance by court decisions.[30] In the early 20th century, the Affiliated Colleges (as they came to be called) began to agree to submit to the regents' governance during the term of President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, as the Board of Regents had come to recognize the problems inherent in the existence of independent entities that shared the UC brand but over which UC had no real control.[30] While Hastings remained independent, the Affiliated Colleges were able to increasingly coordinate their operations with one another under the supervision of the UC president and regents, and evolved into the health sciences campus known today as the University of California, San Francisco.[30]\nIn August 1882, the California State Normal School (whose original normal school in San Jose is now San Jose State University) opened a second school in Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of Southern California.[37] In 1887, the Los Angeles school was granted its own board of trustees independent of the San Jose school, and in 1919, the state legislature transferred it to UC control and renamed it the Southern Branch of the University of California.[38] In 1927, it became the University of California at Los Angeles; the \"at\" would be replaced with a comma in 1958.[39]\nLos Angeles surpassed San Francisco in the 1920 census to become the most populous metropolis in California. Because Los Angeles had become the state government's single largest source of both tax revenue and votes, its residents felt entitled to demand more prestige and autonomy for their campus. Their efforts bore fruit in March 1951, when UCLA became the first UC site outside of Berkeley to achieve de jure coequal status with the Berkeley campus. That month, the regents approved a reorganization plan under which both the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses would be supervised by chancellors reporting to the UC president.[14][15][16][40] However, the 1951 plan was severely flawed; it was overly vague about how the chancellors were to become the \"executive heads\" of their campuses. Due to stubborn resistance from President Sproul and several vice presidents and deans\u2014who simply carried on as before\u2014the chancellors ended up as glorified provosts with limited control over academic affairs and long-range planning while the president and the regents retained de facto control over everything else.[19]\nUpon becoming president in October 1957, Clark Kerr supervised UC's rapid transformation into a true public university system through a series of proposals adopted unanimously by the regents from 1957 to 1960.[20][21] Kerr's reforms included expressly granting all campus chancellors the full range of executive powers, privileges, and responsibilities which Sproul had denied to Kerr himself, as well as the radical decentralization of a tightly knit bureaucracy in which all lines of authority had always run directly to the president at Berkeley or to the regents themselves.[20][21][40] In 1965, UCLA Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy tried to push this to what he saw as its logical conclusion: he advocated for authorizing all chancellors to report directly to the Board of Regents, thereby rendering the UC president redundant.[41] Murphy wanted to transform UC from one federated university into a confederation of independent universities, similar to the situation in Kansas (from where he was recruited).[41] Murphy was unable to develop any support for his proposal, Kerr quickly put down what he thought of as \"Murphy's rebellion\", and therefore Kerr's vision of UC as a university system prevailed: \"one university with pluralistic decision-making\".[41]\nDuring the 20th century, UC acquired additional satellite locations which, like Los Angeles, were all subordinate to administrators at the Berkeley campus. California farmers lobbied for UC to perform applied research responsive to their immediate needs; in 1905, the Legislature established a \"University Farm School\" at Davis and in 1907 a \"Citrus Experiment Station\" at Riverside as adjuncts to the College of Agriculture at Berkeley. In 1912, UC acquired a private oceanography laboratory in San Diego, which had been founded nine years earlier by local business promoters working with a Berkeley professor. In 1944, UC acquired Santa Barbara State College from the California State Colleges, the descendants of the State Normal Schools.[42] In 1958, the regents began promoting these locations to general campuses, thereby creating UCSB (1958), UC Davis (1959), UC Riverside (1959), UC San Diego (1960), and UCSF (1964).[43][44] Each campus was also granted the right to have its own chancellor upon promotion. In response to California's continued population growth, UC opened two additional general campuses in 1965, with UC Irvine opening in Irvine and UC Santa Cruz opening in Santa Cruz.[43] The youngest campus, UC Merced opened in fall 2005 to serve the San Joaquin Valley.\nAfter losing campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to the University of California system, supporters of the California State College system arranged for the state constitution to be amended in 1946 to prevent similar losses from happening again in the future.[42]\nWith decentralization complete, it was decided in 1986 that the UC president should no longer be based at the Berkeley campus, and the UC Office of the President moved to Kaiser Center in Oakland in 1989.[45] That lakefront location was subject to widespread criticism as \"too elegant and too corporate for a public university\".[46] In 1998, the Office of the President moved again, to a newly constructed but much more modest building near the former site of the College of California in Oakland.[47]\nThe California Master Plan for Higher Education of 1960 established that UC must admit undergraduates from the top 12.5% (one-eighth) of graduating high school seniors in California. Prior to the promulgation of the Master Plan, UC was to admit undergraduates from the top 15%. UC does not currently adhere to all tenets of the original Master Plan, such as the directives that no campus was to exceed total enrollment of 27,500 students (in order to ensure quality) and that public higher education should be tuition-free for California residents. Five campuses, Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego, each have current total enrollment at over 30,000, and of these five, all but Irvine have undergraduate enrollments over 30,000.[3]\nAfter the state electorate severely limited long-term property tax revenue by enacting Proposition 13 in 1978, UC was forced to make up for the resulting collapse in state financial support by imposing a variety of fees which were tuition in all but name.[48][49][50] On November 18, 2010, the regents finally gave up on the longstanding legal fiction that UC does not charge tuition by renaming the Educational Fee to \"Tuition\".[51] As part of its search for funds during the 2000s and 2010s, UC quietly began to admit higher percentages of highly accomplished (and more lucrative) students from other states and countries,[52] but was forced to reverse course in 2015 in response to the inevitable public outcry and start admitting more California residents.[53][54]\nOriginally, the president was the chief executive of the first campus, Berkeley. In turn, other UC locations (with the exception of Hastings College of the Law) were treated as off-site departments of the Berkeley campus, and were headed by provosts who were subordinate to the president. In March 1951, the regents reorganized the university's governing structure. Starting with the 1952\u201353 academic year, day-to-day \"chief executive officer\" functions for the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses were transferred to chancellors who were vested with a high degree of autonomy, and reported as equals to UC's president.[14][15][16] As noted above, the regents promoted five additional UC locations to campuses and allowed them to have chancellors of their own in a series of decisions from 1958 to 1964,[43] and the three campuses added since then have also been run by chancellors. In turn, all chancellors (again, with the exception of Hastings) report as equals to the University of California President. Today, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the Office of the Secretary and Chief of Staff to the Regents of the University of California share an office building in downtown Oakland that serves as the UC system's headquarters.[58]\nKerr's vision for UC governance was \"one university with pluralistic decision-making\".[59] In other words, the internal delegation of operational authority to chancellors at the campus level and allowing nine other campuses to become separate centers of academic life independent of Berkeley did not change the fact that all campuses remain part of one legal entity. As a 1968 UC centennial coffee table book explained: \"Yet for all its campuses, colleges, schools, institutes, and research stations, it remains one University, under one Board of Regents and one president\u2014the University of California.\"[60] UC continues to take a \"united approach\" as one university in matters in which it inures to UC's advantage to do so, such as when negotiating with the legislature and governor in Sacramento.[59] The University of California continues to manage certain matters at the systemwide level in order to maintain common standards across all campuses, such as student admissions, appointment and promotion of faculty, and approval of academic programs.[61]\nList of presidents\nMichael V. Drake, 21st President of the University of California (2020-present).\nAll UC presidents had been white men until 2013, when former Homeland SecuritySecretary, and Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano became the first woman to hold the office of UC President.[62] On July 7, 2020, Dr. Michael V. Drake, a former UC chancellor and medical research professor, was selected as the 21st president of the University of California system, making him the first black president to hold the office in UC's 152-year history. He took office on August 1, 2020.[63]\nOfficial residences\nUniversity House, Berkeley served as the official residence of the UC President from 1911 until 1958. Today it serves Berkeley's Chancellor.\nBesides substantial six-figure incomes, the UC president and all UC chancellors enjoy controversial perks such as free housing in the form of university-maintained mansions.[64] In 1962, Anson Blake's will donated his 10-acre (40,000 m2) estate (Blake Garden) and mansion (Blake House) in Kensington to the University of California's Department of Landscape Architecture. In 1968, the regents decided to make Blake House the official residence of the UC president. As of 2005, it cost around $300,000 per year to maintain Blake Garden and Blake House; the latter, built in 1926, is a 13,239-square-foot (1,229.9 m2) mansion with a view of San Francisco Bay.[64]\nBlake House has sat vacant since President Dynes departed in 2008, due to the high cost of needed seismic strengthening and renovating its dilapidated interior (estimated at $3.5 million in 2013).[65] From 2008 to 2022, all three UC presidents during that timeframe (i.e., Yudof, Napolitano, and Drake) lived in rented homes.[65] In 2022, UC finally purchased the Selden Williams House, a 6,400-square-foot (590 m2) house in Berkeley, for $6.5 million to serve as the UC president's official residence.[65] UC had previously owned the same home from 1971 to 1991, when it served as the official residence of the UC vice president.[65] (UC no longer has a single \"vice president\"; the president's direct reports now have titles like \"executive vice president\", \"senior vice president\", or \"vice president\".[66])\nAll UC chancellors traditionally live for free in a mansion on or near campus that is usually known as University House, where they host social functions attended by guests and donors.[67] Berkeley's University House formerly served as the official residence of the UC president, but is now the official residence of Berkeley's chancellor. UCSD's University House was closed from 2004 to 2014 for $10.5 million in renovations paid for by private donors, which were so expensive because the 12,000-square-foot structure sits on top of a sacred Native American cemetery and next to an unstable coastal bluff.[68][69]\nThe State of California currently (2021\u20132022) spends $3.467 billion on the UC system, out of total UC operating revenues of $41.6 billion. The \"UC Budget for Current Operations\" lists the medical centers as the largest revenue source, contributing 39% of the budget, the federal government 11%, Core Funds (State General Funds, UC General Funds, student tuition) 21%, private support (gifts, grants, endowments) 7% ,and Sales and Services at 21%. In 1980, the state funded 86.8% of the UC budget.[70] While state funding has somewhat recovered, as of 2019 state support still lags behind even recent historic levels (e.g. 2001) when adjusted for inflation.[70][71]\nAccording to the California Public Policy Institute, California spends 12% of its General Fund on higher education, but that percentage is divided between the University of California, California State University and California Community Colleges. Over the past forty years, state funding of higher education has dropped from 18% to 12%, resulting in a drop in UC's per student funding from $23,000 in 2016 to a current $8,000 per year per student.[72]\nView of the UC Office of the President.\nIn May 2004, UC President Robert C. Dynes and CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed struck a private deal, called the \"Higher Education Compact\", with Governor Schwarzenegger. They agreed to slash spending by about a billion dollars (about a third of the university's core budget for academic operations) in exchange for a funding formula lasting until 2011. The agreement calls for modest annual increases in state funds (but not enough to replace the loss in state funds Dynes and Schwarzenegger agreed to), private fundraising to help pay for basic programs, and large student fee hikes, especially for graduate and professional students. A detailed analysis of the Compact by the Academic Senate \"Futures Report\" indicated, despite the large fee increases, the university core budget did not recover to 2000 levels.[73] Undergraduate student fees have risen 90% from 2003 to 2007.[74] In 2011, for the first time in UC's history, student fees exceeded contributions from the State of California.[75]\nThe First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled in 2007 that the University of California owed nearly $40 million in refunds to about 40,000 students who were promised that their tuition fees would remain steady, but were hit with increases when the state ran short of money in 2003.[76]\nIn September 2019, the University of California announced it will divest its $83 billion in endowment and pension funds from the fossil fuel industry, ostensibly to avoid the \"financial risk\" inherent in that industry because of climate change, but also responsive pleas to stop investing in fossil fuel.[77]\nIn 2008, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the regional accreditor of the UC schools, criticized the UC system for \"significant problems in governance, leadership and decision making\" and \"confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the university president, the regents and the 10 campus chancellors with no clear lines of authority and boundaries\".[78]\nIn 2016, university system officials admitted that they monitored all e-mails sent to and from their servers.[79]\nAt present, the UC system officially describes itself as a \"ten campus\" system consisting of the campuses listed below.[80] These campuses are under the direct control of the regents and president.[81] Only ten campuses are listed on the official UC letterhead.[82]\nAlthough it shares the name and public status of the UC system, the College of the Law, San Francisco (formerly Hastings College of the Law) is not controlled by the regents or president; it has a separate board of directors and must seek funding directly from the Legislature. However, under the California Education Code, Hastings degrees are awarded in the name of the regents and bear the signature of the UC president.[83] Furthermore, Education Code section 92201 states that Hastings \"is affiliated with the University of California, and is the law department thereof\".[84]\nBerkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego all ranked in the top 50 universities in the world according to both the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2021 and the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) for 2020, while UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Davis ranked in the top 100 universities in the world.[94][95]Forbes also ranked the six UC campuses mentioned above as being in the top 50 universities in America in 2021.[96] Forbes also named the top three public universities in America as all being UC campuses, namely, Berkeley, UCLA, and UCSD, and ranked three more campuses, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Irvine as being among the top 20 public universities in America in 2021.[97] The six aforementioned campuses are all considered Public Ivies.[7] The QS World University Rankings for 2021 ranked three UC campuses: Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego as being in the top 100 universities in the world.[98]\nIndividual academic departments also rank highly among the UC campuses. The 2021 U.S. News & World Report Best Graduate Schools report ranked Berkeley as being among the top 5 universities in the nation in the departments of Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Sciences, Physics, Sociology, History, and English, and ranked UCLA in the top 20 in the same departments.[99][100]U.S. News & World Report also ranked the same departments at UC San Diego among the top 20 in the nation, with the exception of the departments of Sociology, History, and English.[101]UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara ranked in the top 50 in the departments of Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Sciences, Physics, Sociology, History, and English, with the exception of UC Santa Barbara's Psychology and Political Science departments, according to U.S. News & World Report. UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside ranked in the top 100 in the nation in the same departments, along with UC Merced's Psychology and Political Science departments.[102][103][104]\nAs of 2021, UC controls over 13,308 active patents. UC researchers and faculty were responsible for 1,718 new inventions that same year.[2] On average, UC researchers create five new inventions per day.[2]\nAt 40.8 million print volumes,[110] the University of California library system is home to one of the largest collections of printed materials in the world. On July 27, 2021, all ten campuses went live with a unified online library catalog, UC Library Search. Besides on-campus libraries, the UC system also maintains two regional library facilities (one each for Northern and Southern California), which each accept older items from all UC campus libraries in their respective region. As of 2019, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 7.4 million items, while Southern Regional Library Facility is home to 6.5 million items.\nEight campuses operate on the quarter system, while two (Berkeley and Merced) are on the semester system. However, all five law schools operate on the semester system, as does the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\nDue to President Kerr's interest in not reproducing the impersonal undergraduate experience often seen in such gigantic academic units, San Diego and Santa Cruz both implemented residential college systems inspired by British models (in which each college has distinctive general education requirements reflecting its chosen theme)[112] and grouped most academic departments into a small number of broadly defined divisions which are all independent of the colleges.\nFinally, Irvine is organized into 13 schools and San Francisco is organized into four schools, all of which are relatively narrow in scope.\nEach UC campus handles admissions separately, but a student wishing to apply for an undergraduate or transfer admission uses one application for all UC campuses. Graduate and professional school admissions are handled directly and separately by each department or program to which one applies.\nIn May 2020, UC approved plans to suspend standardized testing score requirements in admissions until 2024.[113] In May 2021, after a student lawsuit, the University of California announced that it would no longer consider SAT and ACT scores in admissions and scholarship decisions.[114]\nThe Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) was established in 1976 by University of California (UC) in response to the State Legislature's recommendation to expand post-secondary opportunities to all of California's students including those who are first-generation, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and English-language learners.[115] As UC's largest academic preparation program, EAOP assists middle and high school students with academic preparation, admissions requirements, and financial aid requirements for higher education.[116] The program designs and provides services to foster students' academic development, and delivers those services in partnership with other academic preparation programs, schools, other higher education institutions and community/industry partners.[117]\nThe University of California admits a significant number of transfer students primarily from the California Community Colleges.[118] Approximately one out of three UC students begin at a community college before graduating.[118] In evaluating a transfer student's application the universities conduct a \"comprehensive review\" process that includes consideration of grade point averages of the generally required, transferable and or related courses for the intended major. The review may also include consideration of an applicant's enrollment in selective honor courses or programs, extracurricular activities, essay, family history, life challenges, and the location of the student's residence. Different universities emphasize different factors in their evaluations.[119]\nBefore 1986, students who wanted to apply to UC for undergraduate study could only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus but otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were redirected to another campus with available space.[120][121] Students who did not want to be redirected were refunded their application fees.[citation needed] UC Riverside chancellor Ivan Hinderaker explained in 1972: \"Redirection has been a negative rather than a plus. Some come with a chip on their shoulders so big they never give the campus a chance. They poison the attitudes of the students around them.\"[121]\nTherefore, in 1986, the undergraduate application system was changed to the current \"multiple filing\" system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly increased the number of applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus they did not want to attend.[120]\nThe University of California accepts fully eligible students from among the top one-eighth (1/8) of California public high school graduates through regular statewide admission, or the top 9% of any given high school class through Eligibility in the Local Context (see below). Part of the eligibility process is completion of the A-G requirements in high school. All eligible California high school students who apply are accepted to the university, though not necessarily to the campus of choice.[122][123] Eligible students who are not accepted to the campus(es) of their choice are placed in the \"referral pool\", where campuses with open space may offer admission to those students; in 2003, 10% of students who received an offer through this referral process accepted it.[124] In 2007, about 4,100 UC-eligible students who were not offered admission to their campus of choice were referred to UC Riverside or the system's newest campus, UC Merced.[125] In 2015, all UC-eligible students rejected by their campus of choice were redirected to UC Merced, which is now the only campus that has space for all qualified applicants.[126]\nThe old undergraduate admissions were conducted on a two-phase basis. In the first phase, students were admitted based solely on academic achievement. This accounted for between 50 and 75% of the admissions. In the second phase, the university conducted a \"comprehensive review\" of the student's achievements, including extracurricular activities, essay, family history, and life challenges, to admit the remainder. Students who did not qualify for regular admission were \"admitted by exception\"; in 2002, approximately 2% of newly admitted undergraduates were admitted by exception.[127]\nEligibility in the Local Context, commonly referred to as ELC, is met by applicants ranked in the top 9% of their high school class in terms of performance on an 11-unit pattern of UC-approved high school courses. Beginning with fall 2007 applicants, ELC also requires a UC-calculated GPA of at least 3.0. Fully eligible ELC students are guaranteed a spot at one of UC's undergraduate campuses, though not necessarily at their first-choice campus or even to a campus to which they applied.[122]\nIn 2021, the University of California freshmen class was its most diverse and largest ever, with 84,223 students.[128] Latinos were the largest group at 37%; Asian Americans at 34%; white non-Hispanics at 20%; African-Americans at 5%; and 4% composed of American Indians, Pacific Islanders or those who declined to state their race or ethnicity.[128]\nIn many recent years, the University of California has faced growing criticism for high admissions of out-of-state or international students as opposed to in-state, California students. In particular, UC Berkeley and UCLA have been heavily criticized for this phenomenon due to their extraordinarily low acceptance rates compared to other campuses in the system.[132] At a Board of Regents meeting in 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown reportedly said about the problem: \"And so you got your foreign students and you got your 4.0 folks, but just the kind of ordinary, normal students, you know, that got good grades but weren't at the top of the heap there\u2014they're getting frozen out.\"[133] State lawmakers have proposed legislation that would reduce out-of-state admission.[134]\nA 2020 California auditor's report indicated that at least 64 wealthy students were wrongfully admitted to UC schools as favors to powerful figures.[135][136][137] Many of the admissions were justified by falsely classifying the applicants as student athletes. The incidents disproportionately (55 of 64) occurred at UC Berkeley.\nOn July 24, 2013, the UC Academic Senate adopted an Open Access Policy, mandating that all UC faculty produced research with a publication agreement signed after that date be first deposited in UC's eScholarship open access repository.[139]\nUniversity of California systemwide research on the SAT exam found that, after controlling for familial income and parental education, so-called achievement tests known as the SAT II had 10 times more predictive ability of college aptitude than the SAT I.[140]\nThe University of California has a long tradition of involvement in many enterprises that are often geographically or organizationally separate from its general campuses, including national laboratories, observatories, hospitals, continuing education programs, hotels, conference centers, an airport, a seaport, and an art institute.\nThe Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory conducts unclassified research across a wide range of scientific disciplines with key efforts focused on fundamental studies of the universe, quantitative biology, nanoscience, new energy systems and environmental solutions, and the use of integrated computing as a tool for discovery.\nThe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory uses advanced science and technology to ensure that U.S. nuclear weapons remain reliable. LLNL also has major research programs in supercomputing and predictive modeling, energy and environment, bioscience and biotechnology, basic science and applied technology, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and homeland security. It is also home to the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory focuses most of its work on ensuring the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Other work at LANL involves research programs into preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and US national security, such as protection of the US homeland from terrorist attacks.\nThe UC system's ties to the three laboratories have occasionally sparked controversy and protest, because all three laboratories have been intimately linked with the development of nuclear weapons. During the World War IIManhattan Project, Lawrence Berkeley Lab developed the electromagnetic method for the separation of uranium isotopes used to develop the first atomic bombs. The Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs have been involved in designing U.S. nuclear weapons from their inception until the shift into stockpile stewardship after the end of the Cold War. Historically the two national laboratories in Berkeley and Livermore named after Ernest O. Lawrence, have had very close relationships on research projects, as well as sharing some business operations and staff. In fact, LLNL was not officially severed administratively from LBNL until the early 1970s. They also have much deeper ties to the university than the Los Alamos Lab, a fact seen in their respective original names; the University of California Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore.\nThe UC system's ties to the labs have so far outlasted all periods of internal controversy. However, in 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy for the first time opened the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) contract for bidding by other vendors. UC entered into a partnership with Bechtel Corporation, BWXT, and the Washington Group International, and together they created a private company called Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS). The only other bidder on the LANL contract was a Lockheed Martin Corporation-created company that included, among others, the University of Texas System. In December 2005, a seven-year contract to manage the laboratory was awarded to the Los Alamos National Security, LLC.[142] On October 1, 2007, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, a limited liability company whose members are Bechtel National, the University of California, Babcock & Wilcox, the Washington Division of URS Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, and The Texas A&M University System. Other than UC appointing three members to the two separate boards of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually no responsibility for or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.\nThe NRS was established in January 1965 to provide UC faculty with large areas of land where they could conduct long-term ecosystem research without having to worry about outside disturbances like tourists. Today, the NRS manages 39 reserves that total more than 756,000 acres (3,060 km2).\nUniversity of California Agriculture and Natural Resources[143] (UCANR, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources) plays an important role in the state's agriculture industry, as mandated by UC's legacy as a land-grant institution. In addition to conducting agriculture and Youth development research, every county in the state has a cooperative extension office with county farm advisors. The county offices also support 4-H programs and have nutrition, family, and consumer sciences advisors who assist local government. Currently, the division's University of California 4-H Youth Development Program[144] is a national leader in studying thriving in the field of youth development.[145]\nFrom September 2003 to July 2016, UC managed a contract valued at more than $330 million to establish and operate a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Federal Airfield \u2014the largest grant ever awarded the university. UC Santa Cruz managed the UARC for the University of California, with the goal of increasing the science output, safety, and effectiveness of NASA's missions through new technologies and scientific techniques.\nEach medical center serves as the primary teaching site for that campus's medical school. UCSF is perennially among the top five programs in both research and primary care, and both UCLA and UC San Diego consistently rank among the top fifteen research schools, according to annual rankings published by U.S. News & World Report.[146] The teaching hospitals affiliated with each school are also highly regarded \u2013 the UCSF Medical Center was ranked the number one hospital in California and number 5 in the country by U.S. News & World Report's 2017 Honor Roll for Best Hospitals in the United States.[147] UC also has a sixth medical school\u2014UC Riverside School of Medicine, the only one in the UC system without its own hospital.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the UC hospitals became the cores of full-fledged regional health systems; they were gradually supplemented by many outpatient clinics, offices, and institutes. Three UC hospitals are actually county hospitals that were sold to UC, which means that UC currently plays a major role in providing healthcare to the indigent. The medical hospitals operated by UC Irvine (acquired in 1976), UC Davis (acquired in 1978), and UC San Diego (acquired in 1984) each began as the respective county hospitals of Orange County, Sacramento County, and San Diego County. As of 2021, UC medical centers handle each year about 8.1 million outpatient visits, 349,074 emergency room visits, and roughly 1.1 million inpatient days.[2]\nUnlike other land-grant institutions (e.g., Cornell) UC does not provide a hospitality management program, but it does provide general hospitality at some locations:\nUC Berkeley's Cal Alumni Association operates travel excursions for alumni (and their families) under its \"Cal Discoveries Travel\" brand (formerly BearTreks); many of the tour guides are Berkeley professors. CAA also operates the oldest and largest alumni association-run family camp in the world, the Lair of the Golden Bear. Located at an altitude of 5600 feet in Pinecrest, California, the Lair is a home-away-from-home for almost 10,000 campers annually. Its attendees are largely Cal alumni and their families, but the Lair is open to everyone.\nBerkeley Lab operates its own hotel, the Berkeley Lab Guest House, available to persons with business at the Lab itself or UC Berkeley.\nUC Davis operates the University Airport as a utility airport for air shuttle service in the contractual transportation of university employees and agricultural samples. It is also a public general aviation airport. University Airport's ICAO identifier is KEDU.\nFor over a century, the university has operated a continuing education program for working adults and professionals. At present, UC Extension enrolls over 500,000 students each year in over 17,000 courses. One of the reasons for its large size is that UC Extension is a dominant provider of Continuing Legal Education and Continuing Medical Education in California. For example, the systemwide portion of UC Extension (directly controlled by the UC Office of the President) operates Continuing Education of the Bar under a joint venture agreement with the State Bar of California.\n^ abcTrombley, William (December 27, 1965). \"Chancellors Emerge as Powerful Force in University: New Role of UC Campus Chiefs Seen as One of Most Significant Developments of Past Five Years\".

        "context": "\nThe 2020 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2020 (stylised as UEFA EURO 2020) or simply Euro 2020, was the 16th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international men's football championship of Europe organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).[1] To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the European Championship competition, UEFA president Michel Platini declared that the tournament would be hosted in several nations as a \"romantic\" one-off event, with 11 cities in 11 UEFA countries each providing venues for the tournament, making it the second tournament in the history after the 2007 AFC Asian Cup to have more than two nations co-hosting it.[2] Defending champions Portugal, who won UEFA Euro 2016 in France, were eliminated in the round of 16 by Belgium.[3]Italy won their second European Championship title by beating England on penalties in the final following a 1\u20131 draw after extra time.[4] The win came exactly on the 39th anniversary of Italy's 1982 FIFA World Cup Final win over West Germany.[5]\nThe tournament was originally intended to be played between 12 June and 12 July 2020.[6] However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe during that year, the tournament was postponed to June and July 2021, while retaining the name UEFA Euro 2020 and host venues. Alongside special rules regarding COVID-19, UEFA also allowed two extra substitutions[7] and implemented video assistant referee (VAR) for the first time.[8]\nThe tournament was well received by fans and commentators, with the most goals per game in a European Championship since the introduction of the group stage, and only two goalless games. The refereeing style was also praised, with a conservative use of VAR and quick decisions made on the pitch.\nWhile some countries such as Belgium,[12] Bulgaria and Romania,[13] Germany,[14][15] Hungary and Romania,[16] Ireland, Scotland, and Wales,[17] the Netherlands,[18] and Turkey[19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's elite round, where each of the seven groups was hosted by a different country.[20]\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.[21][22] The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis.[23][24] Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe.[25] Critics cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid.[26]\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017.[27][11][28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021. On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville.[10]\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16\nSuccessful bid for group stage and quarter-finals\nSuccessful bid for semi-finals and final. Later added: Group stage and round of 16\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16 at first but later removed from list\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16 but later changed to another venue in country\nUnsuccessful bid (either rejected as judged by UEFA to not fulfill the bid requirements, or eliminated by vote)\nUEFA held a videoconference on 17 March 2020 with representatives of its 55 member associations, along with a FIFPro representative and the boards of the European Club Association and European Leagues, to discuss the response to the outbreak for domestic and European competitions, including Euro 2020.[32] At the meeting, UEFA announced that the tournament would be postponed to the following year, proposing that it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021.[33] The postponement allowed for pressure to be reduced on the public services in affected countries, while also providing space in the calendar for domestic European leagues that had been suspended to complete their seasons.[34] On the following day, the Bureau of the FIFA Council approved the date change in the FIFA International Match Calendar. As a result, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup, due to take place in June and July 2021, was postponed.[35] On 23 April 2020, UEFA confirmed that the tournament would still be known as UEFA Euro 2020.[36][37]\nIn May 2020, \u010ceferin stated that in principle the tournament would take place in the twelve selected host cities. However, he did not rule out the possibility of reducing the number of cities, as three hosts were unsure if matches could be held under the new schedule.[38] The tournament venues and match schedule was reviewed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 17 June 2020.[39] At the meeting, UEFA confirmed that all twelve original host venues would remain as hosts for the tournament in 2021, and approved the revised match schedule.[40][41] However, \u010ceferin stated in October 2020 that it was still possible that the tournament could be played in fewer than the planned twelve host countries.[42] The following month, UEFA stated that it \"intends to hold Euro 2020 in the format and the venues confirmed earlier this year and we are working closely with all host cities on preparations\".[43] It was also announced that each host was discussing with UEFA and local health authorities on whether the venue could host matches at full capacity, between 100% and 50% capacity, at 33% capacity or behind closed doors. Each host city was asked to draw up two or three plans from the four options. The restrictions could also involve only local spectators to be permitted at matches. A final decision on which scenario would be applied individually at each venue was originally to be made on 5 March 2021.[44][45] In October 2020, it was announced that UEFA matches would be suspended from taking place in Armenia and Azerbaijan until further notice due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.[46] However, this did not affect the planning of Euro 2020 matches to be held in Baku.[47] This restriction was lifted in December 2020 following a ceasefire agreement between the countries.[48]\nIn a New Year's interview, \u010ceferin said, \"Vaccination has started and I think we will be able to have full stands in the summer. For now, the plan is to play in all twelve countries. Of course, there are backup options in case a country has a problem. We are ready to organise competitions in eleven, ten or nine cities... and even only in one country, if necessary. However, I am 99.9 percent sure that we will have the European Championship in all twelve cities, as planned.\"[49][50] On 27 January 2021, UEFA met with the host associations to discuss operational matters, and reaffirmed the tournament would be held across twelve cities.[51] The deadline for hosts to submit their venue capacity plans was moved to 7 April 2021,[52] with a final decision on host cities and spectators to originally be made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 April 2021.[53] UEFA announced on the following day that Daniel Koch, the former head of communicable diseases at Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health, would serve as the tournament's medical advisor on matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[54] In February 2021, the Israel Football Association offered to stage some tournament matches in the country, which had a high rate of vaccination. However, this was turned down by UEFA, who reiterated their commitment to the twelve host cities.[55] In a March 2021 interview, \u010ceferin said, \"We have several scenarios, but the one guarantee we can make is that the option of playing any Euro 2020 match in an empty stadium is off the table. Every host must guarantee there will be fans at their games.\" UEFA subsequently stated that no host city would be automatically dropped should they decide to play matches behind closed doors. However, UEFA would need to consider whether it would make sense to play matches without spectators, or if these matches should be reallocated to other venues.[56] That same month, British prime ministerBoris Johnson offered UEFA to host additional tournament matches in England should any venues need to be reassigned.[57]\nOn 9 April 2021, UEFA announced that eight of the original twelve tournament hosts confirmed their spectator plans, with stadium capacities ranging from 25% to 100%. Only Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome had yet to submit their plans, with each host originally given an extension until 19 April 2021 to submit their venue capacities.[58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had guaranteed spectators for the tournament, and was therefore confirmed as a venue.[59] On 19 April, it was announced that another extension was given to the three remaining hosts until 23 April, when UEFA would make its final decision.[60] Due to the need to finalise ticketing details, host cities would have until 28 April to decide on whether to leave their spectator limits unchanged, or to upscale their allowed capacities.[61]\nAlso on 23 April, UEFA announced that local authorities had guaranteed \"a minimum of 14,500 spectators\" for the matches scheduled in Munich, which was therefore confirmed as host of four games.[10] However, both the regional government of Bavaria and the German interior ministry subsequently reiterated their position that there was no such guarantee, and admittance of spectators would depend on the actual pandemic situation at the time of the tournament.[67] A few days later, UEFA president \u010ceferin backtracked in an interview with a German newspaper, denying that UEFA had demanded guarantees for games with spectators, and conceding that \"the local authorities will decide before the games whether spectators will be admitted or not.\"[68][69]\nWembley Stadium's hosting of both the semi-finals and the final was threatened over quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom that fans and 2,500 VIPs would be subject to. The Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na in Budapest was considered as an alternative venue, as Hungary would have no entry restrictions for travel within the Schengen Area and could host the matches at full capacity.[70] A spokesman for the Hungarian Football Federation said the organisation was \"ready to host any high-level football event\".[71] However, UEFA remained confident that Wembley could host the final, as the organisation and the UK government discussed quarantine exemptions,[72] but did not rule out a change in venue.[73] Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was doing \"as much as we possibly can\" to host the final,[74] while prime minister Boris Johnson stated they would try to make \"sensible accommodations\" for UEFA while still prioritising public health.[75]Italian Prime MinisterMario Draghi said the final should be held in Rome due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom.[76] The following week, it was reported that officials and executives travelling for the matches would not need to self-isolate, though they would be subject to restrictions and required to remain in \"football bubbles\".[77][78]\nOn 31 March 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of a maximum of five substitutions in matches at the tournament (with a sixth allowed in extra time).[7] However, each team are only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity allowed in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time.[79] The use of five substitutes has been permitted by IFAB during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resulting fixture congestion, which has created a greater burden on players.[80]\nAt the start of April 2021, UEFA also said they were considering allowing tournament squads to be expanded from the usual 23 players, following calls from national team managers in case of a possible COVID outbreak in a team, as well as to reduce player fatigue caused by the fixture congestion of the prior season.[81] On 27 April, it was reported that the UEFA National Team Competitions Committee had approved the expansion of squads to 26 players, subject to confirmation by the UEFA Executive Committee.[82] On 4 May 2021, the executive committee confirmed the use of 26-player squads. However, teams still may only name a maximum of 23 players on the match sheet for each tournament fixture (of which 12 are substitutes), in line with the Laws of the Game. These 23 must include three goalkeepers. It was also announced that after each team's first match, goalkeepers may still be replaced due to physical incapacity, even if the other goalkeepers from the squad are still available.[83]\nIf a group of players of a team were placed into mandatory quarantine or self-isolation following a decision from national or local health officials due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, the match will go ahead as scheduled as long as the team had at least 13 players available (including at least one goalkeeper). If fewer than 13 players were available (including at least one goalkeeper), additional players could have been called up to meet the minimum of 13 players required. In such a case, an equivalent number of quarantined players must have been definitively withdrawn from the 26-player list.\nIf a team cannot field the minimum required number of players due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, the match may be rescheduled within the next 48 hours of the original date of the match by the UEFA administration, subject to viable rescheduling options being available. Additionally, UEFA may reassign the rescheduled match to an alternative venue if deemed appropriate.\nIf the match cannot be rescheduled, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will decide on the matter. The team responsible for the match not taking place are considered to have forfeited the match and lost 3\u20130.\nIf any member of the appointed referee team has to be replaced due to positive SARS-CoV-2 test, UEFA can exceptionally appoint a match official of the same nationality as one of the teams or not on the FIFA list.\nThere was no automatic qualifying berth, and all 55 UEFA national teams, including the twelve national teams whose countries were selected to stage matches, had to compete in the qualifiers for the 24 places at the finals tournament.[87][88] As the host cities were appointed by UEFA in September 2014, before the qualifiers, it was possible for the national teams from the host cities to fail to qualify for the finals tournament. The qualifying draw was held on 2 December 2018 at the Convention Centre Dublin in Dublin, Ireland.[89]\nThe main qualifying process started in March 2019, instead of immediately in September 2018 following the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and ended in November 2019. The format remained largely the same, although only 20 of the 24 spots for the finals tournament were decided from the main qualifying process, leaving four spots still to be decided. Following the admission of Kosovo to UEFA in May 2016, it was announced that the 55 members at the time would be drawn into ten groups after the completion of the UEFA Nations League (five groups of five teams and five groups of six teams, with the four participants of the UEFA Nations League Finals guaranteed to be drawn into groups of five teams), with the top two teams in each group qualifying. The qualifiers were played on double matchdays in March, June, September, October and November 2019.[90]\nWith the creation of the UEFA Nations League starting in 2018,[91][90][92][93] the 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League was linked with Euro qualifying, providing teams another chance to qualify for the tournament. Four teams from each division that had not already qualified for the European Championship competed in the play-offs for each division. The winners of the play-offs for each division, which were decided by two one-off semi-finals (the best-ranked team vs. the lowest-ranked team, and the second-best-ranked team vs. the third-best-ranked team, played at home of higher-ranked teams) and a one-off final (with the venue drawn in advance between the two semi-finals winners), joined the 20 teams that had already qualified for the tournament.[93]\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[108] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London.[9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host. Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture. Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mam\u00e9s in Bilbao.[10]\nOf the eleven selected cities and countries, seven cities and six countries had never hosted a European Championship finals match before. Seville was not a venue when Spain hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup, and none of Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, Russia or Scotland had hosted the tournament previously. Of the eleven selected stadiums, only two had hosted a European Championship match before: the Stadio Olimpico (1968 and 1980) and the Johan Cruyff Arena (2000). The original Wembley stadium hosted games and the final in UEFA Euro 1996, but although it stood on the same site, this was classified as a different stadium to the current Wembley Stadium.\nEach city hosted three group stage matches and one match in the round of 16 or quarter-finals, with the exception of Saint Petersburg, which hosted six group stage matches, and London, which hosted host two matches in the round of 16. The match allocation for the eleven stadiums is as follows:\nThe host cities were divided into six pairings, established on the basis of sporting strength (assuming all host teams qualify), geographical considerations and security/political constraints. The pairings were allocated to groups by means of a random draw on 7 December 2017. Each qualified host country played a minimum of two matches at home. The following group venue pairings were announced:[9]\nThe following criteria applied to define the home matches of host teams within the same group:[110]\nIf both host teams qualified directly or both advanced to the play-offs, a draw determined which team would play all three group stage matches at home (including the head-to-head match), and which one played only two matches at home.\nIf one host team qualified directly, and the other failed to also directly qualify, the directly qualified host team played all three group stage matches at home, and the other host, if qualified, would play only two.\nIf one host team advanced to the play-offs, and the other was eliminated entirely, the host team in the play-offs, if qualified, had played all three group stage matches at home.\nNo action was necessary should both host teams failed to have qualified.\nIf a host team in the play-offs failed to qualify, the path winner would take the spot of the host in the match schedule and therefore would play the two or three matches based on the above criteria in the host city of the respective host that failed to qualify. The draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the draw for the play-offs).[111] In the draw, which was only necessary for Group B (Denmark and Russia), two balls were prepared, with the first drawn hosting the three matches.[112]\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions on public gatherings, many of the venues at the tournament were unable to operate at full capacity. UEFA asked each host to devise a spectator plan in conjunction with their local/national government and health authorities. The hosts were given a deadline of 7 April 2021 to communicate their plans with UEFA. On 9 April, UEFA announced that eight of the tournament hosts had confirmed their stadium capacities, ranging from 25% to 100%. The remaining four hosts (Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome) were given an extension until 23 April to submit their venue capacities.[58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had also confirmed its venue capacity.[59] On 23 April, the venue capacity for Munich was also confirmed, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville, which could guarantee spectators. In addition, Dublin was removed as a host, as it was unable to ensure spectators could attend.[10]\nMany of the matches did not see stadiums filled to their allowed capacity, with only Netherlands group stage matches that were played at the Johan Cruyff Arena seeing the stadium come within less than a thousand seats of being full. The match between England and Croatia saw an attendance of 18,497, compared to the allowed capacity of 22,500, with UEFA suggesting quarantine restrictions as the cause for the smaller attendance.[113]\n25% (approximately 22,500) for the group stage and the first match in the round of 16, 50% (approximately 45,000) for the second match in the round of 16 and 67% (approximately 60,000) for the semi-finals and final[120]\nEach team chose a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. Unlike previous tournaments, each team could set up their base camp anywhere due to the pan-European format, without any obligation of staying in any of the host countries.[123]\nThe base camps selected by the 20 directly qualified teams were announced by UEFA on 27 January 2020.[124] The base camps of the remaining teams qualified via the play-offs were announced in 2021.[125]\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019, 18:00 CET (19:00 local time, EET) at Romexpo in Bucharest, Romania.[131][132][133][106] The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four. The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D.[134] Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020,[1] but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known.[112]\nPot 4: Group runners-up ranked 9\u201310 (19\u201320 overall), play-off winners A\u2013D (identity unknown at the time of the draw)\nAs two host teams from the same group could not be in the same seeding pot, the UEFA Emergency Panel would have either switched one host team with the lowest-ranked team of the higher pot, or switched one host team with the highest-ranked team of the lower pot (based on the principle that the move would have minimal impact on the original seeding). However, no seeding adjustments were necessary.\nThe draw started with Pot 1 and completed with Pot 4, from where a team was drawn and assigned to the first available group. The position in the group (for the determination of the match schedule) was then drawn. In the draw, the following conditions applied (including for teams that could still qualify via the play-offs):[136]\nAutomatic group assignments: Host teams were automatically assigned to their group based on the host city pairings.\nProhibited clashes: For political reasons, UEFA set pairs of teams that were considered prohibited clashes. In addition to being unable to be drawn into the same group, non-host teams were prevented from being drawn into a group hosted by a country they clash with, even should the host not qualify. Only one prohibited clash, Russia / Ukraine, applied during the group stage draw. Other prohibited clashes among qualified and play-off teams were Kosovo / Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo / Serbia, but the teams in these pairs were all in the play-offs and in Pot 4 for the draw, and would not be in the same group; Kosovo / Russia was also prohibited,[137] but they also would not be in the same group due to play-off path pairings necessary for host allocation. However, these prohibited clashes are not excluded for the knockout phase.\nDue to the format of the play-offs, which made anticipating all possible scenarios impossible, the UEFA administration had to wait to solve issues relating to the final tournament draw until the completion of the qualifying group stage.[110] It was not possible for UEFA to prevent one of the play-off paths from containing two host teams, resulting in Romania (Group C hosts) and Hungary (Group F hosts) being drawn together in Path A. Therefore, the winner of this play-off path needed to be assigned two groups in the final tournament draw. To allow for this, Path A was paired with Path D (which does not contain a host), therefore providing a clear scenario for each possible qualified team. A draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the play-offs draw), which decided on the order of priority for the allocation of Path A to the final tournament groups.[112]\nTwo balls were prepared containing the names of the two groups hosted by the teams in question (Group C and Group F for Romania and Hungary, respectively). The first ball drawn determined the group (\"priority group\") that was allocated to Path A, with the exception of the host team of the second ball drawn (\"non-priority group\") winning Path A. In the draw, Group F was selected as the priority group, resulting in the following possible outcomes:\nPath A is won by Bulgaria, Hungary or Iceland: The winner of Path A will enter Group F, and the winner of Path D will enter Group C. (As Romania lost in the semi-finals of the play-offs, this was the resulting group assignment.)\nPath A is won by Romania: Romania will enter Group C, and the winner of Path D will enter Group F.\n^ abUkraine could not be drawn into the same group as Russia (Group B host). Since they also could not be drawn into any of the other four groups with Pot 1 hosts, Ukraine were assigned to Group C. Consequently, Belgium were assigned to Group B.\n^Identity of the four play-off winners was unknown at the time of the draw.\n^Romania (Group C host) and Hungary (Group F host) competed in play-off Path A, and thus the winner of Path A was assigned to two groups (Group C and Group F), with the final assignment depending on the identity of the Path A winner.\n^Republic of Ireland (original Group E host) competed in play-off Path B, and thus the winner of Path B was assigned to Group E.\n^Scotland (Group D host) competed in play-off Path C, and thus the winner of Path C was assigned to Group D.\n^Play-off Path D was paired with Path A (which contained two hosts), and thus the winner of Path D was assigned to two groups (Group C and Group F), with the final assignment depending on the identity of the Path A winner.\nTo lessen the load on players due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in case of an outbreak within a team, squad sizes were increased from 23 (used at every European Championship since 2004) to 26. However, the maximum number of players permitted on the match sheet for each tournament fixture remained 23.[83] Each nation's squad, which had to include three goalkeepers, was submitted at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament (by 1 June 2021). If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player;[1] however, goalkeepers could still be replaced after their team's first match due to physical incapacity.[83]\nOn 27 September 2018, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system for the first time at the UEFA European Championship.[8] On 12 February 2020, UEFA and CONMEBOL signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance collaboration, including the possibility of a team of South American match officials appointed for the group stage of the tournament.[139]\nOn 21 April 2021, UEFA announced the 19 refereeing teams for the tournament.[140] This included Argentine referee Fernando Rapallini and his assistants, who were the first South American officials to be selected for the European Championship as part of UEFA's referee exchange programme with CONMEBOL. A group of Spanish officials were similarly selected for the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica.[141]\nA refereeing team of nine officials was appointed for each match. The team of five at the stadium consisted of a referee, two assistant referees, a fourth official and a reserve assistant referee.[141] In addition, four video match officials were located at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. This team consisted of a video assistant referee (the lead video official who was the main point of contact with the referee), an assistant video assistant referee (AVAR 1, who concentrated on following the match), an offside VAR (AVAR 2, who reviewed all potential offside situations) and a support VAR (AVAR 3, who acted in a coordination capacity).[142] The tournament used the 2021 Laws of the Game, which came into force on 1 July but could be introduced in competitions that began immediately beforehand.[143]\nIn addition, UEFA announced 22 video match officials and twelve support match officials (who acted as fourth official or reserve assistant referee).[140] This included support referee St\u00e9phanie Frappart, the first female official at the UEFA European Championship finals.[141]\nUEFA announced the original tournament schedule on 24 May 2018, which only included kick-off times for the opening match and quarter-finals onward.[147][148] The kick-off times of the remaining group stage and round of 16 matches were announced on 30 November 2019 following the final draw.[149] On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced the revised match schedule for the tournament in 2021.[150][151] All match dates, kick-off times and venues remained identical, but shifted one day earlier so matches would remain on the same day of the week (i.e. from 12 to 11 June for the opening match to remain on a Friday). On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced.[152]\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:[1]\nHigher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\nSuperior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\nHigher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\nIf, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 were reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who were still level to determine their final rankings.[a] If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 10 applied;\nIf on the last round of the group stage, two teams were facing each other and each had the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finished level in their match, their ranking was determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion was not used if more than two teams had the same number of points.);\nLower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card);\n^If there was a three-way tie on points, the application of the first three criteria could only break the tie for one of the teams, leaving the other two teams still tied. In this case, the tiebreaking procedure was resumed, from the beginning, for the two teams that were still tied.\n^This criterion could only break a tie if a point deduction were to occur, as multiple teams in the same group could not otherwise be tied on points but have a different number of wins.\nIn the knockout phase, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each), with each team being allowed to make a sixth substitution.[7] If still tied after extra time, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out.[1]\nThe \"Alipay Top Scorer\" award, given to the top scorer of the tournament, was awarded to Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored five goals and recorded one assist.[212] The ranking was determined using the following criteria: goals, assists, fewest minutes played and goals in qualifying.[213]\nThe Goal of the Tournament was decided by online voting. A total 10 goals were in the shortlist. On 14 July 2021, after an open vote with over 800,000 entries, UEFA announced that Czech forward Patrik Schick's second goal against Scotland had been named the goal of the tournament.[214]\nA player was automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:[1]\nReceiving a red card (red card suspensions could be extended for serious offences)\nReceiving two yellow cards in two different matches; yellow cards expired after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions were not carried forward to any other future international matches)\nThe following players earned a suspension during the tournament:[216][217][218]\nThe official logo was unveiled on 21 September 2016, during a ceremony at the City Hall in London. The logo depicted the Henri Delaunay Trophy surrounded by celebrating fans on a bridge, which, according to UEFA, represented how football connects and unifies people.[220][221]\nEach individual host city also had their own unique logo. The rectangular logos featured the text UEFA EURO 2020 on the top, the city name above the text host city on the bottom (all in uppercase), the main tournament logo on the left and a local bridge on the right. Each logo existed in English, along with variations in the local language when applicable. The logos were unveiled from September 2016 to January 2017.\nOn 6 November 2019, UEFA announced that the \"Uniforia\" by Adidas would be the tournament's official match ball. Predominantly white, the ball featured black strokes with blue, neon and pink stripes with panels designed to resemble a hashtag, and had the coordinates of twelve cities which hosted the finals (including Dublin and Bilbao, which were later removed as the host cities). The name was derived from a portmanteau of \"unity\" and \"euphoria\".[236]\nA special variation named \"Uniforia Finale\" was launched on 5 July 2021, to be used in both semi-finals and the final match. The ball had a silver base, a different colour arrangement, and Wembley Stadium's coordinates (51\u00b0 33' 21,5\" N, 0\u00b0 16' 46,4\" W) written on the ball.\nOn 19 October 2019, Dutch DJ and music producer Martin Garrix was announced as the official music artist of the tournament.[238] He produced the official song of the tournament, as well as the walkout music preceding matches and the television broadcast music.[239] The official song, \"We Are the People\", featured Bono and the Edge from Irish rock band U2 and was released on 14 May 2021.[240][241] It was first performed in full at a virtual opening ceremony at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.\nThe game was released by Konami as a free DLC on eFootball PES 2020 in June 2020, and on the eFootball PES 2021 Season Update on launch day. It included the official kits and player likenesses for all 55 officially licensed UEFA teams. The update also included five out of eleven venues of the tournament, as well as the official match ball.[242][243]\nFollowing the match, the Danish team stated that it was unfair they had to decide to continue playing the match.[263] Former Danish international Peter Schmeichel said that the Danish team had been given the options to finish the game that same day, finish the game the next day at 12 pm, or forfeit the game and lose 3\u20130. UEFA denied that either team had been threatened with a forfeit.[264]\nAt a press conference before Hungary vs Portugal on 14 June 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo removed Coca-Cola bottles from the table and then held a water bottle in front of the camera to highlight that water, healthier than Coca-Cola, is his ideal drink;[269][270] it was thought that Ronaldo's actions were behind the collapse of Coca-Cola market value, but it was later found it had nothing to do with it.[271][272] After France vs Germany, France's Paul Pogba, a practising Muslim,[273] moved bottles of non-alcoholic Heineken beer from the table at a press conference.[274] After these two actions, UEFA spoke with each team participating in the European Championship, in which it pointed out the importance of sponsors. UEFA also said that if it happened again, then punishments would be given out to those players.[275]\nIn the run-up to the France vs Germany on 15 June 2021 in Munich, a man with a paramotor got stuck on a fixed rope during a flight over the stadium, fell into a descent, grazed the spectator stands, and landed on the pitch. In the action planned as a protest by Greenpeace against car manufacturer Volkswagen, in which only a large ball with a label was supposed to be thrown onto the field, two people in the stands suffered head injuries and had to receive medical care.[276] The campaign provoked strong criticism due to the endangerment of viewers; UEFA criticised it as a \"reckless and dangerous action\" that could have had serious consequences for many people.[277] The German Football Association (DFB), the Bavarian Prime MinisterMarkus S\u00f6der, and other politicians made similar statements, and Greenpeace apologised. A total flight ban was issued over the stadium for the duration of the European Championship. The Munich police are investigating the paramotor pilot for dangerous bodily harm, trespassing, and violation of the Aviation Act.[278][279]\nIn connection with Pride Month, the German team used related symbolism. Team captain Manuel Neuer wore a captain's armband in rainbow colours in a friendly against Latvia on 7 June and continued to wear the armband in Germany's subsequent games. An investigation by UEFA followed during the group stage of the tournament. They assessed the armband as a \"team symbol for diversity\" and \"a good cause.\" UEFA decided not to impose a penalty because of the rule broken by Neuer, which obliges team captains to wear UEFA captains' armbands.[280]\nBefore the Germany vs Hungary group stage match on 23 June 2021, Munich City Council applied to UEFA to have the fa\u00e7ade of the stadium illuminated in rainbow colours as a sign of diversity and tolerance. Since the project was understood as a protest against a law passed by the Hungarian Parliament that, according to its critics, restricts the \"information rights\" of young people with regard to homosexuality and gender transitioning,[281] UEFA rejected the application with reference to its status as a politically and religiously neutral organisation.[282] After initially approving the illumination of the stadium in rainbow colours, the German Football Association joined the UEFA position. The Mayor of MunichDieter Reiter criticised these decisions and described the illumination not as a political measure but as what he called a sign of humanity and a symbol for the acceptance of equality between people.[283] In contrast, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign AffairsP\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 welcomed UEFA's decision \"not to be involved in a political provocation against Hungary.\"[284]\nOn 3 July 2021, UEFA began an investigation after two fans had a rainbow flag confiscated during the quarter-final match between the Czech Republic and Denmark at the Baku Olympic Stadium in Azerbaijan.[291][292] Photos emerged while the match was being played, showing two stewards taking a rainbow flag, waved in support of the LGBTQ+ community, being taken.[293] In a statement, UEFA said: \"UEFA never instructed stewards in Baku \u2013 or in any other stadium \u2013 to confiscate rainbow flags. We are currently investigating what happened and we will of course contact the UEFA delegate, UEFA security officer and local authorities to clear this up. The rainbow flag is a symbol that embodies UEFA core values, promoting everything that we believe in \u2013 a more just and egalitarian society, tolerant of everyone and UEFA has ensured that the flag was returned to the supporter.\"[294]\nIn the 104th minute in the England vs Denmark semi-final match, on-field referee Danny Makkelie awarded a penalty kick to England after adjudging Danish defender Joakim M\u00e6hle to have fouled English player Raheem Sterling in the penalty area. Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel stopped Harry Kane's penalty kick, but Kane was able to score from the rebound. In a press conference shortly after the match, Danish coach Kasper Hjulmand expressed his dissatisfaction with the penalty decision,[295] as well as the fact that there were two balls on the pitch when the foul was given.[296] Non-English commentators such as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, and Dietmar Hamann criticised the penalty decision during and after the match, arguing that the penalty should not have been awarded when checked by VAR, while Roy Keane described it as \"very, very soft\".[297][298] Former England forward Alan Shearer also described the penalty decision as \"soft\", and said he would be \"pretty angry if that penalty was given against England\", while former England full-back Gary Neville said: \"If we're being fair, you'd be absolutely devastated if you lost to a penalty like that.\" Match official and current ESPN rules analyst Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the UEFA Euro 2016 Final, said he would not have awarded a penalty kick for a tackle of this sort \"in such a key moment.\"[299][300]\nThe Birmingham Mail claimed Denmark disrupted the English wall during a critical free kick that led to the opening goal of the match, and that Denmark's goal should have been disallowed as a result. According to the FIFA Laws of the Game, during a free kick, attackers must be within one metre from the defending team's wall, a rule that was violated by the Danish players who were accused of blocking goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's vision.[301]\nOn 8 July 2021, a day after the match, UEFA opened a disciplinary case against the English Football Association over a laser pointed at Danish goalkeeper Schmeichel just before the decisive penalty, booing when the Danish national anthem was played, and use of pyrotechnics.[302][303][304][305] The laser pointer first came to the notice of both the Football Association and UEFA in the first half of extra time but a search for the culprit was unsuccessful.[306] The Football Association were fined \u00a325,630 (\u20ac30,000) for the three offences.[307][308][309]\nOn the day of the UEFA Euro 2020 Final between Italy and England, thousands of England fans gathered at Wembley Stadium throughout the morning and afternoon, which prompted the police to urge anyone without tickets to not travel there.[310] Two hours before the final, footage showed hundreds of fans fighting with stewards and police as they attempted to force their way past barriers to get into the stadium.[311][312] Around 400 people managed to gain access to the stadium, in block 104, without paying for a ticket.[313] Huge crowds gathered in Leicester Square throwing bottles and other objects, and Trafalgar Square, where a ticketed fan zone was set up.[314] As a result of the violence and disorder, a total of 86 people were arrested by police, 53 of which were made at Wembley stadium for a number of offences, including public order breaches, assault, drunk and disorderly conduct and criminal damage.[315][316][317] 19 police officers were injured, including one who lost a tooth and another suffered a broken hand.[313][318]\nOn 12 July 2021, a day after the final, the Football Association said it would conduct a full review into how people without tickets were able to breach security and gain access to Wembley stadium for the Euro 2020 final.[319][320][321] On 13 July 2021, following the chaotic scenes, UEFA opened a disciplinary case against the Football Association for the invasion of the pitch by an England supporter, throwing of objects by supporters, disturbances during the Italian national anthem, and the use of pyrotechnics.[322][323][324]\nOn 18 October 2021, UEFA punished the Football Association (FA) for the unrest at the final by ordering England to play their next UEFA competition match behind closed doors.[325] UEFA also imposed a ban for a second game, suspended for two years, and fined the FA \u00a384,560 (\u20ac100,000) for the lack of order and discipline inside and around the stadium, for the invasion of the field of play, for the throwing of objects and for the disturbances during the national anthems.[326]\nThe Football Association condemned the racist abuse and said it was \"appalled by the online racism\" aimed at some players on social media.[331] In a statement, it said: \"We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible. We will continue to do everything we can to stamp discrimination out of the game, but we implore government to act quickly and bring in the appropriate legislation so this abuse has real life consequences. Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making their platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse.\"[332]\nThe tournament was admired for its high scoring,[336][337] with 2.78 goals per game a record for any European Championship since the introduction of the group stage in 1980.[338] Two of the highest-scoring games at the European Championship occurred during the tournament. 18 goals scored across four group stage matches on 23 June 2021 were a tournament record,[339] whereas 14 goals scored in the Croatia vs Spain and France vs Switzerland matches on 28 June 2021 made it the highest-scoring day in knockout stages and the second highest overall.[340]\nThe \"light touch\" officiating was also well received, with a perception that referees aimed to keep play moving.[341][342]",

        "context": "\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.[18] In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\nUnder the Articles, which took effect on March 1, 1781, the Congress of the Confederation was a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.[21] This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.[21] The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a president of the United States in Congress Assembled to preside over its deliberation as a neutral discussion moderator. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position without much influence.[23]\nIn 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.[20] By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North Africanpirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.[20] Civil and political unrest loomed. Events such as the Newburgh Conspiracy and Shays' Rebellion demonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working.\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, Alexander Hamilton led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washington's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.[20][24]\nWhen the Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (Rhode Island did not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.[20]New York offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.[20] It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the U.S. Constitution emerged.\nThe election of Andrew Jackson in 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.[30]Jacksonian democracy sought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor, Martin Van Buren, became unpopular after the Panic of 1837,[31] and the death of William Henry Harrison and subsequent poor relations between John Tyler and Congress led to further weakening of the office.[32] Including Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.[33] The Senate played an important role during this period, with the Great Triumvirate of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun playing key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.[34][35]\nAbraham Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War has led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.[D] The circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,[36][37] and Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor Andrew Johnson lost all political support[38] and was nearly removed from office,[39] with Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general Ulysses S. Grant. After the end of Reconstruction, Grover Cleveland would eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900, William McKinley became the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\nAfter McKinley's assassination, Theodore Roosevelt became a dominant figure in American politics.[40] Historians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,[41] with some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor, William Howard Taft. The following decade, Woodrow Wilson led the nation to victory during World War I, although Wilson's proposal for the League of Nations was rejected by the Senate.[42]Warren Harding, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially Teapot Dome,[43] and Herbert Hoover quickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the Great Depression.[44]\nThe ascendancy of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the Imperial presidency.[45] Backed by enormous Democratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change, Roosevelt's New Deal dramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies.[46]: 211\u201312 The traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the Executive Office of the President being created in 1939, none of whom require Senate confirmation.[46]: 229\u2013231 Roosevelt's unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in World War II, and the nation's growing economy all helped established the office as a position of global leadership.[46]: 269 His successors, Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, each served two terms as the Cold War led the presidency to be viewed as the \"leader of the free world\",[47] while John F. Kennedy was a youthful and popular leader who benefited from the rise of television in the 1960s.[48][49]\nWith the Cold War ending and the United States becoming the world's undisputed leading power,[58]Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama each served two terms as president. Meanwhile, Congress and the nation gradually became more politically polarized, especially following the 1994 mid-term elections that saw Republicans control the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine filibusters in the Senate in recent decades.[59] Recent presidents have thus increasingly focused on executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.[60] Presidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W. Bush and Donald Trump, winning in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.[E] Both Clinton and Trump were impeached by a House controlled by the opposition party, but the impeachments did not appear to have long-term effects on their political standing.[61][62]\nThe nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the dominant branch of government; however, they did not expect a strong executive department.[63] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,[64][65] unchecked, unbalanced,[66] and \"monarchist\" in nature.[67] In 2008 professor Dana D. Nelson expressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards \"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\".[68] She criticized proponents of the Unitary executive theory for expanding \"the many existing uncheckable executive powers\u2014such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements\u2014that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\".[68]Bill Wilson, board member of Americans for Limited Government, opined that the expanded presidency was \"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\".[69]\nArticle I, Section1 of the Constitution vests all lawmaking power in Congress's hands, and Article 1, Section 6, Clause2 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the Presentment Clause, which gives the president the power to veto any bill passed by Congress. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a two-thirds vote of both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \"tyranny of the majority\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill. The veto \u2013 or threat of a veto \u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\nVeto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a two-thirds vote.\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a pocket veto.\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the Line Item Veto Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In Clinton v. City of New York, 524U.S.417 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda. Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 requires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \"necessary and expedient\". This is done through the constitutionally-based State of the Union address, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws he believes are needed. Additionally, he can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.[70] Presidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.[71]\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.[72]\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \"virtual army of 'czars'\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\".[73] Presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.[74] This practice has been criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional.[75] Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an \"increasingly swollen executive branch\" and \"the eclipse of Congress\".[76]\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by Article II, Section3 of the Constitution to call a special session of one or both houses of Congress. Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. Harry S. Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the Turnip Day Session. In addition, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.[77][78]\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\nThe president is head of the executive branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\".[79] The executive branch has over four million employees, including the military.[80]\nThe power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.[83] However, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute.[84]\nThe president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government by issuing various types of directives, such as presidential proclamation and executive orders. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.[85] Even so, these directives are subject to judicial review by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional. Congress can overturn an executive order through legislation.\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 4 requires the president to \"receive Ambassadors.\" This clause, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy,[86] and to provide support for the president's exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government.[87] The Constitution also empowers the president to appoint United States ambassadors, and to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a two-thirds majority vote), become binding with the force of federal law.\nWhile foreign affairs has always been a significant element of presidential responsibilities, advances in technology since the Constitution's adoption have increased presidential power. Where formerly ambassadors were vested with significant power to independently negotiate on behalf of the United States, presidents now routinely meet directly with leaders of foreign countries.\nOne of the most important of executive powers is the president's role as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.[88] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this in Federalist No. 69:\nThe President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces... while that [the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of] which... would appertain to the legislature.[89] [Emphasis in the original.]\nIn the modern era, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual.[90] Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war,[91][92] but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903,[91] the Korean War,[91] the Vietnam War,[91] and the invasions of Grenada in 1983[93] and Panama in 1989.[94]\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see Chief JusticeJohn Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, 418U.S.683 (1974), that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, 520U.S.681 (1997), that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.[104]\nThe degree to which the president personally has absolute immunity from court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions. Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions. Clinton v. Jones (1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president, and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019 Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible obstruction of justice, but investigators declined to refer Donald Trump for prosecution based on a United States Department of Justice policy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the New York County District Attorney alleging violations of New York state law.[112]\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \"propagandized leadership\" which has a \"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\".[121] Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.[122] One critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \"in rich detail\" which \"drew on the power of myth\" regarding the incident of PT 109[123] and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.[124] As a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\".[125]\nThe president is typically considered to be the head of their political party. Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\nWith the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world.\"\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\nUnder Article I, Section 3, Clause 7, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.[127][128]\nUnder Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.[129] There is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding Confederates from public office after the Civil War.[130]\nUnder the Twenty-second Amendment, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.[131][132]\nThe modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the party's presidential nominee. Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention. The most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer.[133]\nNominees participate in nationally televised debates, and while the debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third party candidates may be invited, such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates. Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions. Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives.\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.[134] Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.[135] In all but two states, the party whose presidential\u2013vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.[136]Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district.[137][138]\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the party that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are pledged.[139][140] The constitutionality of these laws was upheld in Chiafalo v. Washington (2020).[141] Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an absolute majority of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the House of Representatives must meet to elect a president using a contingent election procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top three electoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a Candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).[135]\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\u201373 electoral vote tie between Thomas Jefferson and fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr in the election of 1800 necessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by Article II, Section 1, Clause3 of the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the runner-up would become vice president.[142] On February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the 1804 election.[143] A quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the election of 1824. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H. Crawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.[144]\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20.[145] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937.[146] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.[147]\nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.[148]\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a Bible while taking the oath, and have added \"So help me God\" to the end of the oath.[149][150] Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the chief justice of the United States.[148]\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the Great Depression and focused on supporting U.S. allied nations at war with the Axis powers, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in World War II, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.[153]\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted in 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term. Harry S. Truman, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full term\u2014to which he would have otherwise been ineligible for re-election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelt's fourth term\u2014before he withdrew from the 1952 election.[153] Since becoming operative in 1951, the amendment has been applicable to six twice-elected presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.\nUnder Section1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession), Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, stated only that the vice president assumes the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.[154] Under this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply act as president,[155] potentially resulting in a special election. Upon the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, Vice President John Tyler declared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \"Acting President\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\".[155] The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C.\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the presidential line of succession follows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of federal executive departments who form the president's cabinet. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.[156]\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Donald Trump in 2019 and 2021; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee conducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in 1973\u201374 and reported three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.[159]\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from Donald Trump's desk.[161] Decades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a stroke that left him partly incapacitated. First lady Edith Wilson kept this condition a secret from the public for a while, and controversially became the sole gatekeeper for access to the president (aside from his doctor), assisting him with paperwork and deciding which information was \"important\" enough to share with him.\nSince 2001, the president's annual salary has been $400,000, along with a: $50,000 expense allowance; $100,000 nontaxable travel account, and $19,000 entertainment[clarification needed] account. The president's salary is set by Congress, and under Article II, Section 1, Clause7 of the Constitution, any increase or reduction in presidential salary cannot take effect before the next presidential term of office.[164][165]\nThe White House in Washington, D.C. is the official residence of the president. The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace\", the \"President's House\", and the \"Executive Mansion\". Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.[166] The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food.[167]\nCamp David, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, a mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, is the president's country residence. A place of solitude and tranquility, the site has been used extensively to host foreign dignitaries since the 1940s.[168]\nPresident's Guest House, located next to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House Complex and Lafayette Park, serves as the president's official guest house and as a secondary residence for the president if needed. Four interconnected, 19th-century houses\u2014Blair House, Lee House, and 700 and 704 Jackson Place\u2014with a combined floor space exceeding 70,000 square feet (6,500 m2) comprise the property.[169]\nThe primary means of long-distance air travel for the president is one of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are extensively modified Boeing 747 airliners and are referred to as Air Force One while the president is on board (although any U.S. Air Force aircraft the president is aboard is designated as \"Air Force One\" for the duration of the flight). In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the Boeing C-32, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight.[170][171]\nFor short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models, designated Marine One when the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the president is actually aboard to any would-be threats.\nThe U.S. Secret Service is charged with protecting the president and the first family. As part of their protection, presidents, first ladies, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames.[175] The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition.[176]\nClinton was active politically since his presidential term ended, working with his wife Hillary on her 2008 and 2016 presidential bids and President Obama on his 2012 reelection campaign. Obama was also active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president Joe Biden on his 2020 election campaign. Trump has continued to make appearances in the media and at conventions and rallies since leaving office.\nThe Former Presidents Act (FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses. The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff. The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by impeachment.[185]\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.[186] Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect congressional pensions.[187] The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and franking privileges.\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.[188][189] In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.[190] On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent presidents.[191] A first spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.[190]\nEvery president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.[192] There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.[194][195] Since Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office.[196][197]\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\n^Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected for a second term as part of the National Union Party ticket with Democrat Andrew Johnson in 1864.\n^Former Democrat John Tyler was elected vice president on the Whig Party ticket with Harrison in 1840. Tyler's policy priorities as president soon proved to be opposed to most of the Whig agenda, and he was expelled from the party in September 1841.\n^Democrat Andrew Johnson was elected vice president on the National Union Party ticket with Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1864. Later, while president, Johnson tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union banner. Near the end of his presidency, Johnson rejoined the Democratic Party.\n^ ab\"The conventions of nine states having adopted the Constitution, Congress, in September or October, 1788, passed a resolution in conformity with the opinions expressed by the Convention and appointed the first Wednesday in March of the ensuing year as the day, and the then seat of Congress as the place, 'for commencing proceedings under the Constitution.'\n\"Both governments could not be understood to exist at the same time. The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\" Owings v.

On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]\nWhile conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[27] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[28][29] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[23]\nPage and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine \"BackRub\", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[20][30][31] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.[32] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[33][34]\nEventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word googol,[20][35][36] a very large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[37]\nGoogle's original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages.[38]\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[20] co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds.[39][40] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment.[41][42]\nGoogle received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[43] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google's initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.[44][45]\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[43] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[49] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[40] Both firms were initially reticent about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted in taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies.[50]\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[51] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[52] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[53][22] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[54] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[55][56]\nAdditionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google.[46] Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.[63]\nOn November 13, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[70][71][72][73] On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[74][75]\nBy 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently.[46]\nIn May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time.[76][77]\nIn May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition to date.[78][79][80] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[81] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[82] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[83]\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze, a $966 million deal.[84] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google's own mapping service.[85]\nGoogle announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company would focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\".[86]\nEntrance of building where Google and its subsidiary Deep Mind are located at 6 Pancras Square, London\nOn January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company from London.[87] Technology news website Recode reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price.[88][89] The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[90]/ In 2015, DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a top human pro at the game of Go.\nAccording to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013,[91] 2014,[92] 2015,[93] and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[94]\nOn August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber\" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[98] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the same day.[99][100][101]\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and Project Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company.[102][103] On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the expos\u00e9, \"How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the 'Father of Android'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48 employees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct.[104] On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints.[105][106] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests.[107] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists.[103]\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel.[112] Most employees were also working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [113]\nIn January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia.[118]\nIn March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia.[119] Google spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia.[120]\nIn April 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project Bernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December.[121]\nIn September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google's capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.[122]\nIn 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part of the public record.[123]\nIn May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google's Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.[124][125]\nIn early 2023, following the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's senior management issued a \"code red\" and a \"directive that all of its most important products\u2014those with more than a billion users\u2014must incorporate generative AI within months\".[126]\nIn early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company\u2019s tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.[127]\nGoogle indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.[128] According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[129] In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.[130][131]\nGoogle launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites.[132] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[133]\nGoogle generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[137]\nIn addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology its acquisition of DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[138][139]\nGoogle Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[141] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[142] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[143] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[144]Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility.\nSome Google services are not web-based. Google Earth, launched in 2005, allowed users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all over the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers.[159]\nIn January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand.[167] It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the \"Nexus\" branding[168] until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.[169]\nIn July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.[171][172]\nIn June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.[173]\nOther hardware products include:\nNest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google Home[174] (later succeeded by the Nest Audio), the Google Home Mini (later succeeded by the Nest Mini), the Google Home Max, the Google Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max.\nNest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi.[175]\nOn March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, \"a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers\" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things, the suite is designed to help \"enterprise class marketers\" \"see the complete customer journey\", generate \"useful insights\", and \"deliver engaging experiences to the right people\".[180] Jack Marshall of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.[181]\nIn February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities.[182][183] Following Google's corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was moved to Alphabet's Access division.[184][185]\nIn April 2015, Google announced Project Fi, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal.[186][187]\nAs a more mature company, Google has made many moves into financial services.\nIn August 2023, it became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation, launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets.[188]\nIn the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[193][194][195]\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.[196] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[197]\nGoogle generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year \u2013 not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\"[198]\nGoogle's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[199] Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[200] By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[201]\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent.[202] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer pricing practices in 2012.[203]\nIn 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the US.[204]\nGoogle Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[205] In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay \u00a3130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[206] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[207]\nIn 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[208]\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\",[209][210] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[32] \"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\"[211][212] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\",[213] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\".[214] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\".[215] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.\nThe original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[216] Since 1998,[update] Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998.[217][218] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-internDennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".[219]\nGoogle has a tradition of creating April Fools' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[220] In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[221]\nOn Fortune magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,[225][226][227] and fourth in 2009 and 2010.[228][229] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index.[230] Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as \"you can make money without doing evil,\" \"you can be serious without a suit,\" and \"work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun.\"[231]\nAs of September 30, 2020,[update] Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees,[232] of which more than 100,000 worked for Google.[8] Google's 2020[update] diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%).[233] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women.[234] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, as of March 2019[update].[8]\nGoogle's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six.\"[235] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense originated from these independent endeavors.[236] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google's vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[237]\nIn 2005, articles in The New York Times[238] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[239][240][241] In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[242] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[243][244] In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[245] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\".[246]\nOn January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced.[247] The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.\"[248] The group is affiliated with UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.[248][249][246] Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.[250] In 2021 court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020 Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\".[251]\nGoogle's New York City office building houses its largest advertising sales team.Google's Toronto office\nGoogle's headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a complex of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[252]\nIn 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The office was designed and built specially for Google, and houses its largest advertising sales team.[253] In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion.[254][255] In March 2018, Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.[256][257][258][259] In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[260] The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood.[261][262] Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.[263]\nIt also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps)[269] and London (part of Android development).[270] In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,[271] Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017.[272][273] In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[274][275]\nGoogle has data centers in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.[277] There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.[278] Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low.[279][280][281] In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[281]\nGoogle disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[290]\nIn 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[291] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[292] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[293]\nIn July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.[294]\nIn December 2016, Google announced that\u2014starting in 2017\u2014it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google \"the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".[295][296][297]\nIn November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.[298] In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.[299]\nIn September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company's foundation in 1998.[300] It also committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.[301] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill.[302]\nIn 2008, Google announced its \"project 10100\" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[314] After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,[315] Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[316]\nResponding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.[317] The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.[318]\nAlso in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit America.[319]\nSan Francisco activists protest privately owned shuttle buses that transport workers for tech companies such as Google from their homes in San Francisco and Oakland to corporate campuses in Silicon Valley.\nIn July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox.[325][326] In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.[327]\nIn August 2018, The Intercept reported that Google is developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) \"that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\".[328][329] However, the project had been withheld due to privacy concerns.[330][331]\nIn 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle.[332] The DeGooglegrassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project\u2014Project Vivian\u2014to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions.[335]\nOn May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformationBrazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630, which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country's government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.[336][337]\nGoogle has aided controversial governments in mass surveillance projects, sharing with police and military the identities of those protesting racial injustice. In 2020, they shared with the FBI information collected from all Android users at a Black Lives Matter protest in Seattle,[338] including those who had opted out of location data collection.[339][340]\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and Amazon will provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel's borders under strict security guidelines.\"[341][342][343] The contract has been criticized by shareholders as well as their employees over concerns that the project will lead to further abuses of Palestinians' human rights in the context of the ongoing illegal occupation and the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.[344][345] Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google's educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google's complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights\u2014to the point of formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear,\" reflecting her view that the ultimatum came in retaliation for her opposition to and organization against the project.[341][346]\nThe European Commission, which imposed three fines on Google in 2017, 2018, and 2019\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of \u20ac2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\"[347]\nOn July 18, 2018,[348] the European Commission fined Google \u20ac4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[349] that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.[350]\nOn October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[351][352][353]\nOn March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a \u20ac1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals.[354][355]\nOn September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal over \u20ac4.125bn (\u00a33.5bn) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google's search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google changed its policy.[356]\nOn January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record \u20ac50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\" before determining its response.[357]\nOn January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet's Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of Cookies along with Facebook.[358]\nAfter U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,[359] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October[360] the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising.[361][362] The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion-$12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones.[363] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and assist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.[364][365]Another suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market.[366]\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.[367][368] The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group's charges.[369][370]Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google's CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.[371]\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices.[372][373][374]\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[375] According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.[376]\n^Google was incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September 27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in tandem with the birthday.[4]\n^ abAuletta, Ken (2010).

        "context": "\nThe world record in the mile run is the fastest time set by a runner in the middle-distancetrack and field event. World Athletics is the official body which oversees the records. Hicham El Guerrouj is the current men's record holder with his time of 3:43.13,[1] while Faith Kipyegon has the women's record of 4:07:64.[2] Since 1976, the mile has been the only non-metric distance recognized by the IAAF for record purposes. However, in international competitions such as the Olympics the term \"mile\" almost always refers to a distance of 1,500 meters, which is 109.344 meters shorter than an Imperial mile, even though four \"full\" laps of a 400 meter track is equal to 1,600 meters.\nAccurate times for the mile run (1.609344 km) have been recorded since 1850, when the first precisely measured running tracks were built. Foot racing had become popular in England by the 17th century, when footmen would race and their masters would wager on the result.[citation needed] By the 19th century \"pedestrianism\", as it was called, had become extremely popular and the best times recorded in the period were by professionals.[citation needed] Even after professional foot racing died out, it was not until 1915 that the professional record of 4:123\u20444 (set by Walter George in 1886) was surpassed by an amateur.[citation needed]\nProgression of the mile record accelerated in the 1930s as newsreel coverage greatly popularized the sport, making stars out of milers such as Jules Ladoum\u00e8gue, Jack Lovelock, and Glenn Cunningham. In the 1940s, Swedes Arne Andersson and Gunder H\u00e4gg lowered the record to just over four minutes (4:01.4) while racing was curtailed during World War II in the combatant countries. After the war, Roger Bannister of the United Kingdom and John Landy of Australia vied to be the first to break the fabled four-minute mile barrier. Roger Bannister did it first on May 6, 1954, and John Landy followed 46 days later.\nAs there was no recognized official sanctioning body until 1912, there are several versions of the mile progression before that year. One version starts with Richard Webster (GBR) who ran 4:36.5 in 1865, surpassed by Chinnery in 1868.[4]\nAnother variation of the amateur record progression pre-1862 is as follows:[5]\nThe first world record in the mile for men (athletics) was recognized by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (later known as the International Association of Athletics Federations and currently known as World Athletics) in 1913.\nTo June 21, 2009, the IAAF has ratified 32 world records in the event.[6]\nThe \"Time\" column indicates the ratified mark; the \"Auto\" column indicates a fully automatic time that was also recorded in the event when hand-timed marks were used for official records, or which was the basis for the official mark, rounded to the 10th of a second, depending on the rules then in place.\nRecords for the mile were rounded up to the nearest tenth of a second commencing January 1, 1957. Previously, records were rounded up to the nearest fifth of a second. Those rounded-up marks were: Cunningham's 4:06.8 (timed at 4:06.7); H\u00e4gg's 4:06.2 (4:06.1); H\u00e4gg's 4:01.4 (4:01.3); Landy's 3:58.0 (3:57.9). Landy's mark was not retroactively adjusted when the new rule came into effect.[7]: vii, 69\u201370 Auto times to the hundredth of a second were accepted by the IAAF for events up to and including 10,000 m beginning in 1981.[6]\nDuring the most recent world record setting race in 1999, Noah Ngeny came in second place to Hicham El Guerrouj with a time of 3:43.40, which continues to be the second fastest mile run in history, beating out the old world record set in 1993 by Noureddine Morceli.[8]\nThe first world record in the mile for women (athletics) was recognized by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (later known as the International Association of Athletics Federations and currently known as World Athletics), in 1967. To June 21, 2009, the IAAF has ratified 13 world records in the event.[10]\nThe \"Time\" column indicates the ratified mark; the \"Auto\" column indicates a fully automatic time that was also recorded in the event when hand-timed marks were used for official records, or which was the basis for the official mark, rounded to the 10th of a second, depending on the rules then in place.\nThe IAAF recognized times to the hundredth of a second starting in 1981.[10]\nNote:\nDecker ran 4:17.55 indoors in Houston on 16 February 1980, but this time was rejected as a record due to an oversized track.\nNatalya Artyomova (Soviet Union) ran 4:15.8 in Leningrad on 6 August 1984, but this time was rejected as a record due to there being no international judges.",

        "context": "\nFor over a decade, Nadal has led men's tennis along with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the Big Three.[c] At the start of his professional career, Nadal became one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching the world No. 2 ranking and winning 16 titles before turning 20, including his first French Open and six Masters events. Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in a historic Wimbledon final, his first major victory off clay. He followed up his win with an Olympic singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, then-24-year-old Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the first man to win majors on three different surfaces (hard, grass, and clay) in the same year (Surface Slam).\nAfter two injury-plagued seasons, Nadal returned to the Tour in 2013, reaching 14 finals, winning two majors and five Masters events including the US Open Series sweep (Summer Slam). He continued his dominance at the French Open, securing six titles, two US Open titles, an Australian Open title, and an Olympic doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics with Marc L\u00f3pez. Nadal surpassed his joint-record with Djokovic and Federer for the most Grand Slam men's singles titles at the 2022 Australian Open, and became one of four men in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles.\nRafael Nadal Parera was born on 3 June 1986 in Manacor, a town on the island of Mallorca in the Balearic Islands, Spain, to parents Ana Mar\u00eda Parera Femen\u00edas and Sebasti\u00e1n Nadal Homar. His father is a businessman who owns an insurance company, a glass and window company (Vidres Mallorca), and the restaurant Sa Punta. His mother once owned a perfume shop, but gave it up to raise Nadal and his younger sister, Mar\u00eda Isabel.[7] One of his uncles, Miguel \u00c1ngel Nadal, is a retired professional footballer who played for RCD Mallorca, FC Barcelona and the Spanish national team.[8] As a child, he idolized Barcelona striker Ronaldo, and through his uncle was given access to the Barcelona team dressing room to have a photo taken with the Brazilian.[9] Another of his uncles, tennis coach Toni Nadal, introduced him to that game when he was three years old.[10]\nNadal started to play tennis at the Manacor Tennis Club, where Toni worked as a coach, hitting his first few shots with his uncle.[7][10] Nadal initially found tennis boring compared with football, which he often played on the streets of Manacor with his friends.[7][11] He began to play tennis more consistently when he was five, and Toni quickly realized that his young nephew had both the passion and talent to be a serious player.[10]\nAt age 8, Nadal won an under-12 regional tennis championship; at the time he was also a promising football player.[7][12] This win inspired Toni to train Nadal more intensively, and his uncle, after studying Nadal's then-two-handed forehand stroke, encouraged him to play left-handed, as it would give him a natural advantage on the tennis court.[12][13] The transition was difficult for Nadal, but Toni helped him make the change, getting him to try it for just 20 minutes per day before gradually increasing that time until he fully adjusted himself to it.[7]\nIn February 1998, Nadal won the Open Super 12, an unofficial world championship for U12 players held in Auray. It was the first time that Nadal competed outside of Spain and he beat the 1997 winner Jamie Murray in the final.[14] At the time, Nadal was still hesitating between football and tennis, in part because his uncle Miguel \u00c1ngel was preparing to compete in the 1998 World Cup with Spain, but in the end it was Auray who decided it.[15] In a letter in French that he sent to the organizers in 2010, Nadal stated that winning this tournament helped him make the decision to \"opt for tennis and try an international career\".[14][15] Latter in 1998, at age 12, Nadal won the Spanish and European tennis titles in his age group (while still also playing football).[12] Nadal's father told him he had to choose between football and tennis so that his schoolwork would not deteriorate entirely. Nadal said: \"I chose tennis. Football had to stop straight away.\"[12]\nBy the time Nadal was 14, he had made a name for himself in the Spanish junior circuit by winning multiple age group titles.[21] Those achievements earned him a tennis scholarship in Barcelona, and the Spanish tennis federation requested that Nadal leave Mallorca and move to Barcelona to continue his tennis training.[7] His family turned down this request, partly because they feared his education would suffer,[12] but also because Toni said, \"I don't want to believe that you have to go to America or other places to be a good athlete. You can do it from your home.\"[7][10] Furthermore, Nadal already was by then practicing three times a week at Palma with his childhood idol and fellow Majorcan, the former World No. 1 Carlos Moya, who later became Nadal\u2019s mentor and confidant,[7][10] and whom Nadal beat in 2000, at the time still a Top-10 player, in an exhibition match.[22] The decision to stay home meant less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs.[12]\nNadal turned professional at the beginning of 2001, at the age of 14. While most of his contemporaries were making their first steps on the ITF Junior Circuit, Nadal took a different approach and played just two events on the ITF junior Tour, both after turning 16 in 2002,[23] reaching the semifinals of the junior singles event at Wimbledon,[24] and then helping Spain defeat the US in the final of the Junior Davis Cup in his second and final appearance on the ITF Junior Circuit.[24][25] He thus posted a 9\u20131 career junior record in singles, 4\u20131 on grass and 5\u20130 on clay.[24] He had a career-high juniors singles ranking of world No. 145, attained on 30 December 2002.[24]\nIn early 2001, at age 14, Nadal began playing the qualifying draws of professional tournaments. Although he managed to win some matches, he failed to qualify for the main draws in any of the 10 Spanish Futures he played between January and September.[26] He also had the chance to compete in the qualifying round of the ATP 250 event at home in Mallorca, but failed to qualify.[23] In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match.[8] Nadal finally made his pro debut in the main draws at the Futures in Madrid on 11 September 2001, wasting no less than 13 match points against Guillermo Platel-Varas in the opening round.[23][27][28] A week later he received a wild card into the main draw of the Challenger in Seville, his first Challenger tournament, and he ousted world No. 751 Israel Matos Gil 6\u20134 6\u20134 to claim his first pro win and earn the first five ATP points of his career to become world No. 1002.[26][23][28] At age 15, Nadal ended 2001 world No. 811.[26]\nIn 2002, Nadal, then ranked No. 762, received a wild card to the ATP 250 event on his home island of Mallorca,[29] where on 29 April, at 15 years and 10 months of age, Nadal won his first ATP match by defeating No. 88 Ram\u00f3n Delgado,[30] and became the ninth player in the Open Era to do so before the age of 16.[26][31] In doubles, Nadal and his partner, Bartolom\u00e9 Salv\u00e1 Vidal, were defeated in the first round by David Adams and Simon Aspelin.[32] Nadal then won six of the nine Futures events he entered from July until December, including 5 on clay and 1 on hard courts, but he did not reach any doubles finals.[26][33] Nadal finished 2002 with a Futures record of 40\u20139 in singles and 10\u20139 in doubles, and ended 2002 world No. 199.[34][35]\nNadal continued his incredible ascent in early 2003, reaching the finals of Challengers at Hamburg, Cherbourg and Cagliari, and winning at Barletta.[26] He then qualified for his second career ATP event, the Monte Carlo Masters, where in the second round he beat the 2002 French Open champion Albert Costa in straight sets and entered the world\u2019s top 100.[26][36] In May 2003, Nadal injured his elbow in a fall while training and was forced to postpone his French Open debut.[37] He then qualified directly to Wimbledon, thus having never contested in a major qualifying event before.[38] In his major main draw debut in Wimbledon, he became the youngest man to reach the third round since Boris Becker in 1984.[22][39]\nNadal then participated at Umag, where he lost to former world No. 1 Carlos Moy\u00e1 in the semifinals. Nadal also competed in seven doubles tournaments in 2003, and won his first ATP title (doubles or singles) at Umag, partnering \u00c1lex L\u00f3pez Mor\u00f3n to defeat Todd Perry and Thomas Shimada in the final.[40] Nadal won his second Challenger title of the year in August at Segovia, thus entering the top 50 and winning the ATP Newcomer of the Year Award.[26] Nadal finished the year ranked as the world No. 49.[26]\nIn the 2004 Davis Cup final, the 18-year-old Nadal beat world No. 2 Andy Roddick on clay in Spain to help his nation clinch the title over the United States, and in doing so at 18 years and six months of age, he became the youngest player to register a singles victory in a Davis Cup final for a winning nation.[13][22][45] Apart from the 2004 Davis Cup, Nadal won hardly any other match on the tour and finished the year ranked as the world No. 51.[26]\nAt the 2005 Australian Open, Nadal lost in the fourth round to eventual runner-up Lleyton Hewitt. Two months later, he reached the final of the 2005 Miami Masters, and despite being two points from a straight-sets victory, he was defeated in five sets by No. 1 Roger Federer. Both performances were considered breakthroughs for Nadal.[46][47]\nThree days after his victory in Paris, Nadal's 24-match winning streak was snapped in the first round of the grass court Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany, where he lost to Alexander Waske.[50] He then lost in the second round of 2005 Wimbledon to Gilles M\u00fcller of Luxembourg. Immediately after Wimbledon, Nadal won 16 consecutive matches and three consecutive tournaments, bringing his ranking to No. 2 on 25 July 2005. Nadal started his North American summer hard-court season by defeating Agassi in the final of the 2005 Canada Masters, but lost in the first round of the 2005 Cincinnati Masters. Nadal was seeded second at the 2005 US Open, but was upset in the third round by No. 49 James Blake in four sets.\nIn September, he defeated Coria in the final of the China Open in Beijing and won both of his Davis Cup matches against Italy. In October, he won his fourth Masters title of the year, defeating Ivan Ljubi\u010di\u0107 in the final of the 2005 Madrid Masters. He then suffered a foot injury that prevented him from competing in the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup.[51]\nBoth Nadal and Federer won eleven singles titles and four Masters titles in 2005. Nadal broke Mats Wilander's previous teenage record of nine in 1983.[52] Eight of Nadal's titles were on clay, and the remainder were on hard courts. Nadal won 79 matches, second only to Federer's 81. Also, he earned the highest year-end ranking ever by a Spaniard and the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year award.\nNadal missed the Australian Open because of a foot injury.[53] In February, he lost in the semifinals of the first tournament he played, the Open 13 tournament in Marseille, France. Two weeks later, he handed Roger Federer his first loss of the year in the final of the Dubai Duty Free Men's Open (in 2006, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray were the only two men who defeated Federer). To complete the spring hard-court season, Nadal was upset in the semifinals of the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, by James Blake, and was upset in the second round of the 2006 Miami Masters.\nOn European clay, Nadal won all four tournaments he entered and 24 consecutive matches. He defeated Federer in the final of the Masters Series Monte Carlo in four sets. The following week, he defeated Tommy Robredo in the final of the Open Sabadell Atl\u00e1ntico tournament in Barcelona. After a one-week break, Nadal won Italian Open title defeating Federer in a fifth-set tiebreaker in the final, after saving two match points and equaling Bj\u00f6rn Borg's tally of 16 ATP titles won as a teenager. Nadal broke Argentinian Guillermo Vilas's 29-year male record of 53 consecutive clay-court match victories by winning his first round match at the French Open. Vilas presented Nadal with a trophy, but commented later that Nadal's feat was less impressive than his own because Nadal's winning streak covered two years and was accomplished by adding easy tournaments to his schedule.[54] Nadal went on to play Federer in the final of the French Open. The first two sets of the match were hardly competitive, as the rivals traded 6\u20131 sets. Nadal won the third set easily and served for the match in the fourth set before Federer broke him and forced a tiebreaker. Nadal won the tiebreaker and became the first to defeat Federer in a Grand Slam tournament final.[55]\nNadal injured his shoulder during a quarterfinal match against Lleyton Hewitt at the Artois Championships, played on grass at the Queen's Club in London.[56] Nadal was unable to complete the match, which ended his 26-match winning streak. Nadal was seeded second at Wimbledon, and was two points from defeat against American qualifier Robert Kendrick in the second round before coming back to win in five sets. In the third round, Nadal defeated No. 20 Andre Agassi in straight sets in Agassi's last career match at Wimbledon. Nadal also won his next three matches in straight sets, which set up his first Wimbledon final, which was against Federer, who had won this tournament the three previous years. Nadal was the first Spanish man since Manuel Santana in 1966, to reach the Wimbledon final, but Federer won the match in four sets to win his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title.\nNadal played only three tournaments the remainder of the year. Joachim Johansson, ranked No. 690, upset Nadal in the second round of the Stockholm Open. The following week, Nadal lost to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych in the quarterfinals of the year's last Masters tournament, the Mutua Madrile\u00f1a Masters in Madrid. During the round-robin stage of the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, Nadal lost to James Blake but defeated Nikolay Davydenko and Robredo. Because of those two victories, Nadal qualified for the semifinals, where he lost to Federer. This was Nadal's third loss in nine career matches with Federer.\nNadal went on to become the first player since Andre Agassi in 1994\u201395 to finish the year ranked No. 2 in consecutive years.\nHe had comparatively more success after returning to Europe to play five clay-court tournaments. He won the titles at the Monte-Carlo Masters, the Open Sabadell Atl\u00e1ntico in Barcelona, and the Italian, before losing to Roger Federer in Hamburg Masters final. This defeat ended his 81-match winning streak on clay, which is the male Open Era record for consecutive wins on a single surface. He then rebounded to win the French Open for the third straight year, defeating Federer once again in the final. Between the tournaments in Barcelona and Rome, Nadal defeated Federer in the \"Battle of Surfaces\" exhibition match in Mallorca, Spain, with the tennis court being half grass and half clay.[57]\nNadal played the Artois Championships at the Queen's Club in London for the second consecutive year. As in 2006, Nadal was upset in the quarterfinals. Nadal then won consecutive five-set matches during the third and fourth rounds of Wimbledon before being beaten by Federer in the five-set final. This was Federer's first five-set match at Wimbledon since 2001.[58] In July, Nadal won the clay-court Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, which proved to be his last title of the year. He played three important tournaments during the North American summer hard court season. He was a semifinalist at the Canadian Masters in Montreal before losing his first match at the Cincinnati Masters. He was the second-seeded player at the US Open, but was defeated in the fourth round by David Ferrer.\nAfter a month-long break from tournament tennis, Nadal played Madrid Masters and Paris Masters. David Nalbandian upset him in the quarterfinals and final of those tournaments. To end the year, Nadal won two of his three-round robin matches to advance to the semifinals of the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, where Federer defeated him in straight sets.\nDuring the second half of the year, Nadal battled a knee injury suffered during the Wimbledon final. In addition, there were rumors at the end of the year that the foot injury he suffered during 2005, caused long-term damage, which were given credence by coach Toni Nadal's claim that the problem was \"serious\". Nadal and his spokesman strongly denied this, however, with Nadal himself calling the story \"totally false\".[59]\nDuring the spring clay-court season, Nadal won four singles titles and defeated Roger Federer in three finals. He beat Federer at the Monte Carlo Masters for the third straight year, capturing his Open Era record fourth consecutive title there.[60] Nadal then won his fourth consecutive title at the Open Sabadell Atl\u00e1ntico tournament in Barcelona. A few weeks later, Nadal won his first Masters Hamburg title defeating Federer in a three-set final. He then won the French Open, becoming the fifth man in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam singles title without losing a set.[61] He defeated Federer in the final for the third straight year, but this was the most lopsided of all their matches, as Nadal only lost four games and gave Federer his first bagel since 1999.[60] This was Nadal's fourth consecutive French title, tying Bj\u00f6rn Borg's all-time record. Nadal became the fourth male player during Open era to win the same Grand Slam singles tournament four consecutive years (the others being Borg, Pete Sampras, and Federer).\nNadal then played Federer in the final of Wimbledon for the third consecutive year, in the most anticipated match of their rivalry.[62][63] Nadal entered the final on a 23-match winning streak, including his first career grass-court title at the Stella Artois Championships staged at the Queen's Club in London prior to Wimbledon. Federer had won his record fifth grass-court title at the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, and then reached the Wimbledon final without losing a set. Unlike their previous two Wimbledon finals, though, Federer was not the prohibitive favorite, and many analysts picked Nadal to win.[63][64] They played the longest (in terms of time on court, not in terms of numbers of games) final in Wimbledon history, and because of rain delays, Nadal won the fifth set 9\u20137 in near-darkness. (The 2019 final later broke the record of longest Wimbledon final.) The match was widely lauded as the greatest Wimbledon final ever, with some tennis critics even calling it the greatest match in tennis history.[65][66][67][68][69]\nBy winning his first Wimbledon title, Nadal became the third man in the open era to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, after Rod Laver in 1969, and Borg in 1978\u20131980, (Federer later accomplished this the following year) as well as the second Spaniard to win Wimbledon. He also ended Federer's record streak of five consecutive Wimbledon titles and 65 straight wins on grass courts. This was also the first time that Nadal won two Grand Slam tournaments back-to-back.\nAt the US Open, Nadal was the top-seeded player for the first time at a major. He did not lose a set during his first three matches, defeating qualifiers in the first and second rounds and Viktor Troicki in the third round. In the semifinals, he lost to Andy Murray. Later in the year in Madrid, Nadal helped Spain defeat the United States in the Davis Cup semifinals. At the Madrid Masters, Nadal lost in the semifinals to Gilles Simon. However, his performance at the event guaranteed him the year-end No. 1 ranking, making him the first Spaniard to finish a season as such in the Open Era.[71] Two weeks later at the Paris Masters, Nadal reached the quarterfinals, where he withdrew because of a knee injury.[72] The following week, Nadal announced his withdrawal from the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, citing tendinitis of the knee. On 10 November, Nadal withdrew from Spain's Davis Cup final against Argentina, as his knee injury had not healed completely.[73]\nNadal's first ATP Tour event for the season was the Qatar Open, where he lost in the quarterfinals to Ga\u00ebl Monfils. Nadal also entered and won the tournament's doubles event partnering Marc L\u00f3pez, where they defeated the No. 1-ranked doubles team of Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonji\u0107 in the final. At the 2009 Australian Open \u2013 Men's singles, Nadal won his first five matches without dropping a set, before defeating Fernando Verdasco in the semifinals in the second longest match in Australian Open history at 5 hours and 14 minutes.[74] This set up a championship match with Roger Federer, their first meeting in a hard-court major. Nadal defeated Federer in a five-set final to earn his first hard-court major singles title,[75] and become the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open.[76]\nNadal began his European clay court season at the Monte Carlo Masters, where he defeated Novak Djokovic to win a record fifth consecutive singles title there.[82] He then won back to back titles in Barcelona and Italian Open, defeating Ferrer and Djokovic respectively.[83][84] He then surprisingly lost the final of the Madrid Open to Roger Federer. This was the first time that Nadal had lost to Federer since the semifinals of the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup.\nBy beating Lleyton Hewitt in the third round of the French Open, Nadal set a record of 31 consecutive wins at the French Open, beating the previous record of 28 by Bj\u00f6rn Borg. This run came to an end on 31 May 2009, when Nadal lost to eventual runner-up, Robin S\u00f6derling in the 4th round. This was Nadal's first and, until 2015, only loss at the French Open. After his surprise defeat in France, Nadal withdrew from the AEGON Championships. It was confirmed that he was suffering from tendinitis in both of his knees.[85] On 19 June, Nadal withdrew from the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, citing his recurring knee injury.[86] Roger Federer went on to win the title, and Nadal consequently dropped back to No. 2 on 6 July 2009.\nOn 4 August, Toni Nadal confirmed that Nadal would return to play at the Rogers Cup in Montreal.[87] There, he lost in the quarterfinals to Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro.[88] With this loss, he relinquished the No. 2 spot to Andy Murray on 17 August 2009, ranking outside the top two for the first time since 25 July 2005.\nNadal has called 2010 his best year as a professional tennis player. The 2010 tennis season Nadal became the first male player in tennis history to win Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard court) in the same calendar year.\nEntering the French Open, many were expecting another Nadal-Federer final. However, Robin S\u00f6derling defeated Federer in the quarterfinals.[96] Nadal advanced to the final and defeated S\u00f6derling in straight sets. The victory marked the second time that Nadal had won the French Open without dropping a set.\nIn June, Nadal entered the AEGON Championships, which he had won in 2008. He was defeated by compatriot Feliciano L\u00f3pez in the quarterfinals. At the Wimbledon Championships, he won his first two matches in straight sets. In the third round he needed five sets to defeat Philipp Petzschner. During the match Nadal was warned twice for allegedly receiving coaching from his coach and uncle, Toni Nadal, resulting in a $2,000 fine by Wimbledon officials.[97][98] He then defeated Andy Murray in the semifinals and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych in the final to win his second Wimbledon title and his eighth career major title[99] just past the age of 24.[100]\nIn his first tournament since Wimbledon, Nadal advanced to the semifinals of the Rogers Cup, where he was defeated by Andy Murray.[101] Nadal also competed in the doubles with Djokovic in a high-profile partnership between the world Nos. 1 and 2.[102] The pair lost in the first round to Milos Raonic and Vasek Pospisil. The next week, Nadal was the top seed at the Cincinnati Masters, losing in the quarterfinals to Marcos Baghdatis.\nIn the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, Nadal suffered a hamstring injury against David Ferrer early in the pair's quarterfinal match and ultimately lost in straight sets, thus ending his effort to win four major tournaments in a row.[111]\nNadal began his clay-court season by winning the 2011 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters with the loss of just one set. In the final, he avenged his defeat by David Ferrer in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open.[116] Just a week later, Nadal won his sixth Barcelona Open crown, again defeating Ferrer in straight sets. He then lost to Novak Djokovic in the Italian Open and Madrid Open finals.[117] However, Nadal retained his No. 1 ranking during the clay-court season and won his sixth French Open title by defeating Roger Federer.[118]\nAt Wimbledon, Nadal reached the final after three four-set matches. This set up a final against No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who had beaten Nadal in all four of their matches in 2011. After dropping the third set, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the fourth. Djokovic's success at the tournament also meant that the Serb overtook Nadal as world No. 1. After resting for a month from a foot injury sustained during Wimbledon, he contested the 2011 Rogers Cup, where he was beaten by Croatian Ivan Dodig in the quarterfinals. He next played in the 2011 Cincinnati Masters, where he lost to Mardy Fish, again in the quarterfinals.\nAt the 2011 US Open, Nadal made headlines when after defeating David Nalbandian in the fourth round, he collapsed in his post-match press conference because to severe cramps.[119] He again lost in four sets to Novak Djokovic in the final. After the US Open, Nadal made the final of the Japan Open Tennis Championships. Nadal, who was the 2010 champion, was defeated by Andy Murray. At the Shanghai Masters, he was upset in the third round by No. 23 ranked Florian Mayer. At the 2011 ATP Finals, Nadal was defeated by Roger Federer and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the round-robin stage, and was subsequently eliminated from the tournament. In the Davis Cup final in December, he helped Spain win the title with victories over Juan M\u00f3naco and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro.[120]\nNadal began his ATP Tour season at the Qatar Open. In the semifinal, he lost to Ga\u00ebl Monfils in two sets.[121] In the Australian Open Nadal won his first four matches without dropping a set. He then won in his quarterfinal and semifinal matches against Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych and Roger Federer respectively. In the final, on 29 January, he was beaten by Novak Djokovic in a five-set match that lasted 5 hours and 53 minutes, the longest Grand Slam final of all time.[122]\nNadal made it to the semifinals in Indian Wells, where he was beaten in straight sets by eventual champion Roger Federer. He also made the semifinals in Miami, but withdrew because of knee problems.\nAs the clay court season started, Nadal was seeded 2nd at the 2012 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters. In the final he topped No. 1 Novak Djokovic to win his 8th consecutive Monte Carlo trophy. This ended a streak of seven straight final losses to Djokovic. A day after the Monte Carlo final, Nadal traveled to Barcelona where he received a bye in the first round. His tremendous record on clay continued as he beat compatriot David Ferrer in a three-set final to clinch his seventh title in eight years at the Barcelona Open. At the Mutua Madrile\u00f1a Madrid Open Nadal surprisingly lost to Fernando Verdasco, whom he held a 13\u20130 record against. He heavily criticized the new blue-colored clay and threatened not to attend in the future if the surface was not changed back to red clay. Several other players such as Novak Djokovic voiced similar criticism.[123] In the last tournament before the French Open, Nadal defeated Djokovic in a tight straight-set final. This was his second victory over Novak Djokovic in 2012 and his third title of the season, as well as his 6th Rome title overall.\nAt the 2012 French Open, Nadal dropped only 30 games against his first five opponents. In the semifinals he dismantled Ferrer to set up another final against Novak Djokovic. This marked the first time two opposing players faced each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals. Nadal won the first two sets before Djokovic claimed the third. Play was suspended in the fourth set due to rain. When the match resumed the following day, Nadal won when Djokovic double-faulted on match point, sealing a record 7th French Open title for Nadal.[124] By winning his seventh title[125] at the French Open, Nadal surpassed Borg's overall titles record[126] to become the most successful male player in French Open history.[127] Nadal lost a total of only three sets in the 2012 clay court season.\nAs a warm-up ahead of Wimbledon Nadal played in Halle, losing to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the quarterfinals.[128] At Wimbledon, Nadal was upset in the second round by Luk\u00e1\u0161 Rosol in a close five-set match. This was the first time since the Wimbledon 2005 championships that Nadal had failed to progress past the 2nd round of a Grand Slam tournament.[129]\nIn July 2012, Nadal withdrew from the 2012 Olympics owing to tendinitis in his knee, which subsequently led to him pulling out of both the Rogers Cup and the Cincinnati Masters. He later withdrew from the rest of the 2012 season, as he felt he still was not healthy enough to compete.[130][131] Nadal ended 2012 ranked No. 4 in the world, the first time in eight years that he has not been ranked 1st or 2nd at the end of the year.\nTwo weeks prior to the Australian Open, Nadal officially withdrew from the tournament citing a stomach virus.[132] Nadal's withdrawal saw him drop out of the ATP's Top Four for the first time since 2005.[133] Playing in his first tournaments in South America since 2005, Nadal made his comeback at the VTR Open in Chile,[134] where he was upset by Argentine No. 73 Horacio Zeballos in the final. At the Brasil Open, Nadal reached the final, where he defeated David Nalbandian.[135] In the title match of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in Acapulco, Nadal defeated David Ferrer, losing just two games in the match.\nNadal then returned to the American hard courts, playing the Indian Wells Masters as the fifth seed. He lost only one set, and defeated No. 2 Roger Federer and No. 6 Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych before beating Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in the final. After withdrawing from Miami, Nadal attempted to defend his title at the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, but was beaten by Djokovic in straight sets. He then won his eighth title at the Barcelona Open. Nadal went on to win the Mutua Madrid Open, beating Stanislas Wawrinka in the final. In May, he defeated Roger Federer for his 7th championship at the 2013 Italian Open. These victories raised his ranking to No. 4.\nNadal won the 2013 French Open after beating Novak Djokovic in the semifinal and David Ferrer in the final, breaking the record for the most match wins in the tournament in the process with his 59th match victory.[136] His match with Djokovic is widely considered one of the greatest clay court matches ever played, as Nadal came back from down a break in the fifth set to take out a hard-fought 4-hour, 37-minute victory. Nadal then lost his first-round match at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships in straight sets to unseeded Belgian Steve Darcis (ranked No. 135), the first time he had ever lost in the first round of a major.\nIn August, Nadal won a close semifinal match in Montreal, denying Djokovic his fourth Rogers Cup title.[137] Nadal proceeded to win the title after beating Milos Raonic in the final in straight sets.[138] He won his 26th Masters title in Cincinnati on Sunday 18 August after beating John Isner in the final.[139] Nadal concluded a brilliant North American hard court season with his 4th hard court title of the year, defeating Djokovic at the 2013 US Open final in four sets, bringing his Grand Slam count to 13 and giving him a male tennis record paycheck of $3.6 million.[140][141]\nLater in September, Nadal helped Spain secure their Davis Cup World Group Playoff spot for 2014, with a victory against Sergiy Stakhovsky and a doubles win with Marc Lopez. In October, he reached the final of the China Open, helping him regain the No. 1 ranking.[142] In the final, he was beaten by Djokovic in straight sets.[143] At the 2013 Shanghai Rolex Masters, he reached the semifinals but was defeated by Del Potro. In November, Nadal played his final event of the season in London at the 2013 ATP Finals where he secured the year-end No. 1 spot. He beat David Ferrer, Stanislas Wawrinka and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych in the round robin stage to set up a semifinal victory over Roger Federer. Nadal met Djokovic in the final, losing in straight sets.\nAt the Australian Open, he defeated Roger Federer to reach his third Australian Open final. This marked Nadal's 11th consecutive victory in a major semifinal, second only to Borg's all-time record of 14. In the final, he faced Stanislas Wawrinka, against whom he entered the match with a 12\u20130 record. However, Nadal suffered a back injury during the warm-up, which progressively worsened as the match wore on.[146] Nadal lost the first two sets, and although he won the third set, he ultimately lost the match in four sets. The first tournament he played after that was the inaugural Rio Open which he won after defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov in the final. However, at the Indian Wells Masters, Dolgopolov would avenge his loss, defeating Nadal in three sets in the third round. He reached the final of the Miami Masters, falling to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.\nNadal lost to eventual runner-up Djokovic in the quarterfinals of the French Open, ending his winning streak of 39 consecutive victories in Paris since his defeat by Robin S\u00f6derling in 2009.[166] Nadal went on to win the 2015 Mercedes Cup against Serbian Viktor Troicki, his first grass court title since he won at Wimbledon in 2010.[167] He was unable to continue his good form on grass as he lost in the first round of the Aegon Championships to Alexandr Dolgopolov in three sets.[168] Nadal's struggles continued when he lost in the second round of Wimbledon to Dustin Brown.[169]\nIn the third round of the 2015 US Open, Nadal once again lost to Fognini, despite having won the first two sets.[170] This early exit ended Nadal's record 10-year streak of winning at least one major.\nNadal started the year winning the Mubadala Title defeating Milos Raonic in straight sets. After that, he entered the Doha, Qatar, where he reached the finals, losing to Djokovic in straight sets. This was their 47th match, after which Djokovic led their head-to-head rivalry with 24 matches won. At the Australian Open, Nadal was defeated in five sets by compatriot Fernando Verdasco in the first round. The defeat marked his first opening round exit at the Australian Open.[171]\nIn April he won his 28th Masters title in Monte Carlo.[172] He went on to win his 17th ATP 500 in Barcelona, winning the trophy for the ninth time in his career.[173]\nHe continued the clay court season in Madrid, falling to Murray in the semifinal.[174]\nThe following week, Nadal played in Italian Open where he reached the quarterfinal. Nadal was again defeated by Djokovic in straight sets, although he had a break advantage in both sets and served to win the second.[175]\nFollowing Federer's withdrawal due to injury, Nadal was named the fourth seed at the French Open.[176] On 26 May, he became the eighth male player in tennis history to record 200 Grand Slam match wins, as he defeated Facundo Bagnis in straight sets in the second round of the Slam.[177] Following the victory, however, Nadal had to withdraw from competition owing to a left wrist injury initially suffered during the Madrid Open,[178] handing Marcel Granollers a walkover into the fourth round.[179] On 9 June, Nadal announced that the same wrist injury that forced him to withdraw from the French Open needed more time to heal, and that he would not play at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships.[180] At the Rio 2016 Olympics, Nadal achieved 800 career wins with his quarterfinal victory over the Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci. Partnering Marc L\u00f3pez, he won the gold medal in men's doubles event for Spain by defeating Romania's Florin Mergea and Horia Tecau in the finals.[181] This made Nadal the second man in the Open Era to have won gold medals in both singles and doubles. Nadal also advanced to the bronze medal match in the men's singles but was defeated by Kei Nishikori.\nAt the US Open Nadal was seeded 4th and advanced to the fourth round but was defeated by 24th seed Lucas Pouille in 5 sets. The defeat meant that 2016 was the first year since 2004 in which Nadal had failed to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final.[182] He played the Shanghai Masters and was upset in the second round by Viktor Troicki. He subsequently ended his 2016 season to let his wrist recover.\nNadal opened his season by playing at the Brisbane International for the first time, where he reached the quarterfinals before losing to Milos Raonic in three sets.[183] In the second round of the tournament, he defeated Mischa Zverev for the loss of just two games;[184] Nadal began the Australian Open with straight-set wins over Florian Mayer and Marcos Baghdatis, before more difficult wins over Alexander Zverev and Gael Monfils, which set up his first quarterfinal berth at a Grand Slam since the 2015 French Open. Nadal defeated Raonic and Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinal and semifinal, respectively (the latter lasting for five sets over five hours), to set up a final against Roger Federer, his first Grand Slam final since he won the 2014 French Open. Nadal went on to lose to Federer in five sets; this was the first time that Nadal had lost to Federer in a Grand Slam since the final of the 2007 Wimbledon Championships.\nNadal made it to the final of Acapulco without dropping a set, but was defeated by big-serving Sam Querrey. In a rematch of the Australian Open final Nadal took on Roger Federer in the fourth round at Indian Wells but again lost to his old rival, this time in straight sets; it was their earliest meeting in a tournament in over a decade. In the Miami Masters, Nadal reached the final to again play Federer, and was once again defeated in straight sets.[185] Nadal then won his 29th Masters title in Monte Carlo; it was his tenth victory in the principality, the most wins by any player at a single tournament in the Open era.[186]\nNadal won his 18th ATP 500 title in Barcelona without dropping a set, also marking his tenth victory in Barcelona.[187] Nadal next played in the Madrid Open, where he defeated Dominic Thiem to tie Novak Djokovic's all-time Masters record of 30 titles.[188]\nNadal went on to beat Stan Wawrinka in straight sets and win a record tenth French Open title. This marked his first Grand Slam title since 2014, ending his three-year drought in Grand Slams.[189] Nadal won every set that he played in the tournament, dropping a total of only 35 games in seven matches, which is the second-fewest by any male player (second only to Bj\u00f6rn Borg's 32 dropped games at the 1978 French Open) en route to a major title in the Open Era.[citation needed] The title \"La D\u00e9cima\" (\"the tenth\" in Spanish) was used to proclaim Nadal's achievement in becoming the first player, male or female, to win 10 titles at a single major in the Open Era, following similar feats at Monte Carlo and Barcelona. Nadal also climbed to second on the all-time major singles titles list, with 15, placing him one ahead of Pete Sampras.[190]\nBy 21 August, he retook the ATP No. 1 ranking from Andy Murray. Nadal earned his third US Open title against first-time Grand Slam finalist Kevin Anderson, winning the final in straight sets. This marked the first time that Nadal had captured two Grand Slam tournaments in a year since 2013, and the second time since 2010. Nadal extended his winning streak by winning the China Open, winning the final against Nick Kyrgios in straight sets.[192] On 11 September 2017, Nadal and Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza made Spain the first country since the United States 14 years ago to simultaneously top both the ATP and the WTA rankings, with Muguruza making her debut in the No. 1 spot.[193]\nAfter defeating Hyeon Chung in the second round of the Paris Masters Nadal secured the year-end No. 1. He became year-end No. 1 for the fourth time in his career, tying him for fourth all-time with Novak Djokovic, Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe, behind Pete Sampras (6), and Roger Federer and Jimmy Connors (5). By securing the year-end no. 1 ranking, Nadal became the first player aged over 30 to finish as year-end No. 1 and the first to finish in the top spot four years since he last achieved the feat; he also broke a number of other historical records, all of which he broke again in 2019.[194]\nOn 16 February, Nadal dropped to the No. 2 ranking after 26 weeks at the top when his rival Roger Federer overtook him in points. Nadal withdrew from the Mexican Open, Indian Wells Masters, and Miami Open due to an injury. Despite his absence in Miami, he regained the No. 1 ranking on 2 April due to Federer's second-round loss. After recovering from injury, Nadal helped secure the Spanish Davis Cup team a victory over Germany in the quarterfinal of the World Group. He beat Philipp Kohlschreiber and Alexander Zverev in straight sets.[196]\nAt the Monte Carlo Masters, Nadal successfully defended his title and won a then-record-breaking 31st Masters title, thus becoming the player with the most Masters titles in tennis history. It also marked his 11th title in Monte Carlo, as well as the 76th title in his career. Because he defended the points won the previous year, he kept his No. 1 ranking and began his 171st week as the world No. 1.[197] Nadal won in Monte Carlo without dropping a set, beating Kei Nishikori in the final. Nadal went on to win his 11th title in Barcelona, defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets, becoming the first player in the open era to win 400 matches on both clay and hard.[198][199] The win marked his 20th ATP 500 series title, which put him back atop the list of most ATP 500 titles, tied with Roger Federer. It also marked his 14th consecutive season with at least one ATP 500 title.\nFresh after achieving the \"Undecima\" at Monte Carlo and Barcelona, Nadal had to defend yet another title at Madrid. He reached the quarterfinals, defeating Gael Monfils and Diego Schwartzman in straight sets, to extend his record to 50 consecutive sets won on clay, starting from the 2017 French Open. His win over Schwartzman broke John McEnroe's record of 49 straight sets won on a single surface.[200] McEnroe had previously achieved the record on carpet in 1984. In a surprise, Nadal lost in straight sets to Dominic Thiem in the quarterfinals, ending his 21-match and record 50-set winning streaks on clay. He also relinquished his world No. 1 ranking to Federer in the process.\nAt the Italian Open, Nadal captured his 8th title in the Italian capital as well as his 78th career title, defeating Alexander Zverev in three sets, thus overtaking John McEnroe in the fourth place on the list of most titles won in the Open Era.[201] It was Nadal's 32nd Masters title \u2013 most of any player in the Open Era. With his victory in Rome, Nadal also regained the No. 1 spot from Federer.\nThen at the French Open, Nadal won his 17th Grand Slam title. This tied Margaret Court's record for singles titles at a Grand Slam event (Court won 11 Australian Opens, but seven came when it was the Australian Championships, an amateur event). En route to the title, Nadal dropped only one set, beating Dominic Thiem in the final in three sets.[202] Nadal became just the fourth man in the Open Era to win three or more major titles after turning 30.\nGoing into Wimbledon, Nadal was ranked world number one, but was seeded second due to Wimbledon's seeding algorithm. He made it to the quarterfinals without dropping set. He then faced #5 seed Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, who he defeated in five sets. In the semifinals he faced long-time rival Novak Djokovic, who was aiming to reach his first major final since the 2016 US Open. This match lasted 5 hours and 17 minutes, spread over two days, becoming the second-longest Wimbledon semifinal in history, second only to the match between Kevin Anderson and John Isner held earlier on the same day. Djokovic defeated Nadal in five sets with the fifth set being 10\u20138.[203] This was Nadal's first defeat in the semifinals of a major since the 2009 US Open, and his first-ever defeat in the semifinals of Wimbledon. Despite this, Nadal achieved his best results at Wimbledon since 2011. This performance, combined with Roger Federer's unsuccessful title defence, ensured that Nadal retained the world number one ranking after the grass season.\nHe then won the Rogers Cup, a record-extending 33rd Masters title.[204] This was Nadal's first Masters title win on hard court since 2013. He then withdrew from the Cincinnati Masters to prepare for the US Open. Nadal was the top seed during his title defence at the US Open. He first faced David Ferrer in Ferrer's last Grand Slam match, who retired due to injury during the second set. In his semi-final matchup against Juan Martin del Potro, Nadal retired after losing the second set 6\u20132 due to knee pain. On 31 October, he announced his withdrawal from the Paris Masters due to an abdominal injury and as a result Novak Djokovic replaced him as world No. 1.[205]\nNadal was due to start his season at the Brisbane International, but withdrew shortly before due to an injury. He was seeded second at the 2019 Australian Open, where he progressed to his fifth Australian Open final, and did so without losing a set. Nadal then lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic, winning only eight games for the match and marking Nadal's first straight-sets defeat in a major final.[206] Nadal next played at the Mexico Open, where he lost to Nick Kyrgios in the second round despite holding three match points.[207] He withdrew from both Indian Wells and Miami due to a right hip injury.[208]\nAt the 2019 French Open, Nadal defeated Kei Nishikori and Roger Federer (their first meeting at the tournament since 2011) en route to the final, dropping only one set en route. In a rematch of the previous year's final, Nadal prevailed in four sets against Thiem to claim his record-extending twelfth French Open title.[212] In doing so, he broke Margaret Court's all-time record of singles titles won at the same major.[213]\nNadal next played at Wimbledon and, like the previous year, reached the semifinals, where he faced Federer for the first time at Wimbledon since the 2008 final. Nadal lost the match in four sets.[214] At the Rogers Cup, Nadal was the defending champion and top seed. By defeating Fabio Fognini in the quarterfinals, he surpassed Roger Federer's record of 378 victories at Masters tournaments.[215] In the final, Nadal yielded just three games to Daniil Medvedev, winning in straight sets. This victory marked the first time he defended a title on a surface other than clay.[216] At the US Open, Nadal lost only one set (against Marin \u010cili\u0107) en route to the final, where he won against Medvedev in five sets. In doing so, Nadal claimed his fourth US Open title and 19th major title overall (placing him only one behind Roger Federer in overall standings), and completed his second-best season in terms of Grand Slam singles results.[217] At the Paris Masters, Nadal reached the semifinals, but withdrew due to an abdominal injury.[218]\nAt the ATP Finals, Nadal defeated Tsitsipas and Medvedev in the round-robin stage, but failed to progress to the semifinals.[219] Despite his elimination, Nadal secured the year-end No. 1 ranking when Djokovic was also eliminated in the round-robin stage. This was Nadal's fifth time as the year-end No. 1 player, drawing level with Jimmy Connors, Federer and Djokovic behind Pete Sampras (six), and in doing so, he surpassed a number of the records he set in 2017, becoming (at the time) the oldest person to finish as the year-end No. 1 player, and creating a record eleven-year gap between his first and last year-end No. 1 seasons (2008 and 2019, respectively).[220]\nAt the 2019 Davis Cup Finals, Nadal helped Spain win its sixth Davis Cup title, defeating Canada in the final. Nadal won all eight of his matches in singles and doubles, extending his winning streak in Davis Cup singles matches to 29 (29\u20131 record overall), without dropping a set or having his serve broken;[221][222][223] he also won the tournament's Most Valuable Player award.[223]\nNadal won his 13th French Open title, beating Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the tournament's final, only losing seven games. In doing so, he won his 20th Grand Slam title, equalling Roger Federer's record as the man with the most Grand Slam titles.[228][229] It also marked his 100th win at the tournament, losing only twice in 16 years. His straight-sets victory over Djokovic marked also the 4th time that he won a Grand Slam without losing a set, all at the French Open, doing it also in 2008, 2010 and 2017.[230]\nAt the Paris Masters, Nadal defeated compatriot Feliciano L\u00f3pez in the second round to get his 1,000 victory in the ATP Tour, becoming the fourth man in the Open Era to achieve that milestone.[231] He then reached the semifinals where he lost to Alexander Zverev in straight sets.[232]\nOn 9 November 2020, Nadal reached his 790th back to back week as one of the ten highest placed players on the ATP rankings and surpassed the record held by Jimmy Connors.[233]\nAt the 2020 ATP Finals, Nadal played in the London 2020 group. He defeated Rublev and defending champion Tsitsipas progressing to the semifinals and securing ending the year as no. 2.[234] It was the first time since 2015 that Nadal reached the semifinals.[235] Nadal then lost his semifinal match to eventual champion Daniil Medvedev in three sets.[236] This was the seventh time that Nadal had finished Year-end No. 2 and now leads the \"Big Three\" with 12 Top 2 finishes.[237]\nAt the 2021 Australian Open, Nadal lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 5 Stefanos Tsitsipas, despite being two sets to love up. This marked only the second time Nadal had lost a Grand Slam match after being two sets up.[238] Nadal next played at the Monte Carlo Masters and defeated Federico Delbonis and Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals, where he lost to Andrey Rublev in three sets.[239]\nOn 25 April, Nadal won a record-extending twelfth Barcelona Open trophy with a three-set victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, saving a championship point in the third set.[240] At 3 hours and 38 minutes, this was the longest best-of-three-set ATP Tour final since statistics started being tracked in 1991.[241] He followed up in May by making the quarterfinals at the Madrid Open and winning his record-extending tenth Italian Open title.[242] In the latter, he saved two match points against Denis Shapovalov and defeated Novak Djokovic in the final.\nAt the French Open, Nadal entered as the heavy favorite seeking to become the first man to win 21 majors. He reached the semifinals after wins over Jannik Sinner and Diego Schwartzman, where he encountered Novak Djokovic in a rematch of the previous year's final. There, Nadal was upset by eventual champion Djokovic in four sets, in only his third-ever loss at the French Open. Following his loss, Nadal withdrew from both Wimbledon and the Olympics, citing schedule reasons.[243]\nOn 20 August 2021, just 10 days out from the US Open, Nadal announced that would be ending his 2021 season due to the left foot issue that had been troubling him for most of the year. Therefore, his ranking fell to No.6, due to his injury.[248]\nAt the Mexican Open, Nadal won the title without dropping a set, which included a win over Medvedev, who that week had clinched the world No. 1 ranking. He also extended his winning streak to 15 matches, his best start to a season in his career. Nadal next entered the 2022 Indian Wells Masters as the fourth seed. After seeing off a final set tie-break from Sebastian Korda in the second round, Nadal beat Dan Evans, Reilly Opelka, Nick Kyrgios, and Carlos Alcaraz to reach his fourth final of the season and extend his winning streak to 20 matches.[253][254] Nadal was beaten by Taylor Fritz in straight sets in the final, ending his winning streak.[255] On 22 March, it was reported that Nadal will be unable to play for between four and six weeks, due to a rib stress fracture that occurred during Indian Wells.[256]\nNadal returned at the Madrid Open, where he defeated Miomir Kecmanovic, David Goffin in the second and third rounds respectively. He then lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a rematch of their Indian Wells semifinal. Nadal then entered Rome, where he was the defending champion. He defeated John Isner in straight sets, but then lost to Denis Shapovalov in three sets despite leading by a set and a break.\nAt the French Open, Nadal recorded his 106th win defeating Jordan Thompson in the first round. With a 106\u20133 record at the French Open, he became the player with the most wins at a single major. He recorded his 300th career major win by defeating Corentin Moutet in the second round.[257][258] He defeated Botic van de Zandschulp in the third round and faced Felix Auger Aliassime (coached by Nadal's uncle Toni) in the fourth round, winning the encounter after being taken to five sets for only the third time in his career at the French Open. Nadal met Djokovic for a record-extending 59th time in the quarterfinals \u2013 the first singles match in tennis history to feature two players each holding at least 20 Grand Slam titles and 1000 career match wins. Nadal emerged victorious in four sets to advance to his 15th French Open semifinal.[259] He faced Alexander Zverev in a grueling battle lasting over three hours with only two sets played, and ended with Zverev's retirement due to an ankle injury. As a result, Nadal advanced to his record-extending 14th French Open final. There, he defeated Casper Ruud in three dominant sets to win his 14th French Open title and 22nd major title overall. In doing so, he became the then-oldest French Open champion ever, and the third man to earn four Top-10 wins en route to a major title since the ATP rankings started in 1973, after Mats Wilander (1982 French Open) and Roger Federer (2017 Australian Open). He ascended to world No. 4 on 6 June 2022.[260]\nAfter treating his foot injury, Nadal returned to Wimbledon for the first time in three years, however he tore an abdominal muscle during the tournament. Following wins over Francisco Cer\u00fandolo, Ri\u010dardas Berankis, Lorenzo Sonego, and Botic van de Zandschulp, he faced Taylor Fritz in the quarterfinal, which aggravated his abdominal injury. Despite winning the encounter, Nadal withdrew from the tournament the following day.[261]\nAt the Laver Cup, Nadal competed for Team Europe alongside his fellow Big Four members Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.[265] He played one match on Day 1, where he partnered in doubles with long-time rival Federer, for Federer's final professional match. They lost to Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe.[266] Nadal withdrew from the tournament the following day, citing \"personal reasons\".[267]\nNadal was the defending champion at the 2023 Australian Open, but lost in straight sets to Mackenzie McDonald in the second round.[269][270] During the match, Nadal was severely hampered by a hip injury for which he received treatment. In late February, Nadal officially announced his withdrawal from the Indian Wells and Miami Masters to recuperate from the injury he sustained at the Australian Open.[271]\nAs a result, he exited the Top 10 for the first time since 25 April 2005 (after 18 years, 912 consecutive weeks) on 20 March 2023, ending the longest Top-10 streak in ATP rankings history.[272] According to tournament organizers, Nadal was aiming to make a comeback despite the injury at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters but withdrew in April.[273][274] He later declined to enter the French Open as well, meaning he missed the entire clay court season. Nadal's withdrawal from the French Open meant he dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since 2003.[275] He didn't return for the grass-court season, including Wimbledon, nor\nthe American hard-court season, including the US Open. As a result he failed to qualify for the world tour finals.\nIn September he hinted he would like to return in 2024 and that next year might be his last year in professional tennis.[276]\nFreezing cold water. I do this before every match. It's the point before the point of no return. Under the cold shower I enter a new space in which I feel my power and resilience grow. I'm a different man when I emerge. I'm activated. I'm in \"the flow\"... Nothing else exists but the battle ahead.\nRoger Federer and Nadal have been playing each other since 2004, and their rivalry is a significant part of both men's careers.[65][278][279] They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 to 14 August 2009,[280] and again from 11 September 2017 to 15 October 2018. They are the only pair of men to be consistently ranked in the Top 2 for four years continuously (from July 2005 to August 2009).[281][282] Nadal ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008.[283]\nThey have played 40 times. Nadal leads 24\u201316 overall and 10\u20134 in Grand Slam tournaments. Nadal has a winning record on clay (14\u20132) and outdoor hard courts (8\u20136), while Federer leads the indoor hard courts 5\u20131 and grass 3\u20131.[284]\nAs tournament seedings are based on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals, including a joint-record nine Grand Slam tournament finals (tied with Djokovic\u2013Nadal).[285] From 2006 to 2008, they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final, and also met in the title match of the 2009 Australian Open, the 2011 French Open and the 2017 Australian Open.[285] Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Four of these matches were five-set matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), and the 2008 Wimbledon final has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts.[66][286][287][288] Nadal is the only player who has competed and won against Federer in the final of a Grand Slam on all three surfaces (grass, hard, and clay).\nNovak Djokovic and Nadal have met 59 times (more than any other pair in the Open Era). Nadal leads 11\u20137 at Grand Slam events but trails 29\u201330 overall.[137][289][290] They have played a record 18 Grand Slam matches and a joint-record nine Grand Slam tournament finals (tied with Nadal\u2013Federer). Nadal leads on clay 20\u20138, while Djokovic leads on hard courts 20\u20137, and they are tied on grass 2\u20132.[137][290] In 2009, this rivalry was listed as the third greatest of the previous 10 years by ATPworldtour.com.[291] Djokovic is one of only two players to have at least ten match wins against Nadal (the other being Federer) and the only person to defeat Nadal seven consecutive times, doing so twice, and two times consecutively on clay. The two earlier shared the record for the longest match played in a best of three sets (4 hours and 3 minutes) at the 2009 Mutua Madrid Open semifinals until the match between Roger Federer and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in the London 2012 Olympics Semifinal, which lasted 4 hours and 26 minutes.[292][293] They have also played in a record 14 ATP Masters finals.\nIn their first ever meeting in a Grand Slam final at the 2010 US Open Nadal prevailed over Djokovic in four sets. Nadal achieved a Career Grand Slam with this victory.[294] In the 2011 Wimbledon final, Djokovic won in four sets for his first Grand Slam final victory over Nadal.[295] Djokovic also defeated Nadal in the 2011 US Open Final. In 2012, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the Australian Open final for a third consecutive Grand Slam final win over Nadal. This is the longest Grand Slam tournament final in Open era history at 5 hours, 53 minutes.[296] Nadal won their last three 2012 meetings in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters, Italian Open and French Open in April, May, and June 2012, respectively.[297] In 2013, Djokovic defeated Nadal in straight sets in the final at Monte Carlo, ending Nadal's record eight consecutive titles there, but Nadal got revenge at the French Open in an epic five-setter 9\u20137 in the fifth. In August 2013, Nadal won in Montreal, denying Djokovic his fourth Rogers Cup title.[137] Nadal also defeated Djokovic in the 2013 US Open Final.\nNadal defeated Djokovic in the 2014 French Open final. Djokovic then won seven consecutive meetings including a win in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the 2015 French Open which ended Nadal's 39-match win streak at the French Open and an opportunity for a sixth consecutive title, with Djokovic becoming only the second player after Robin S\u00f6derling to defeat Nadal at the event. Nadal easily defeated Djokovic in the 2017 Madrid Open semifinals (6\u20132, 6\u20134), his first victory against the Serb since the 2014 French Open. When they next met Nadal beat Djokovic again, this time on clay in the 2018 Rome semifinals. They then met in the 2018 Wimbledon semifinals, where Djokovic finally emerged victorious after a battle lasting over five hours that was spread over two days and went to 10\u20138 in the fifth set. Then in the 2019 Australian Open final, Djokovic easily won in straight sets, marking Nadal's first straight-sets loss in a Grand Slam final. But in the 2019 Italian Open final, it was Nadal who defeated the Serbian in three sets, and also featured the first time either of them (Nadal) got a 6\u20130 win in a set.\nIn the final of the postponed 2020 French Open, Nadal easily defeated Djokovic in straight sets (including a second 6\u20130) for his record-tying 20th Grand Slam Championship. At the following year's French Open semifinals, however, Djokovic defeated Nadal in four bruising sets en route to his title win and double Career Grand Slam. Nadal avenged his loss after defeating Djokovic in four sets in the quarterfinals of the 2022 French Open. It marked the first tennis match in history to feature two players holding at least 20 major titles and 1000 career match-wins.\nNadal and Andy Murray have met on 24 occasions since 2007, with Nadal leading 17\u20137. Nadal leads 7\u20132 on clay, 3\u20130 on grass, and 7\u20135 on hard courts (including 4\u20134 on outdoor courts, but Nadal leads 3\u20131 on indoor hard courts), but trails 1\u20133 in finals. The pair once met regularly at Grand Slam level, with nine out of their 23 meetings coming in Grand Slams, with Nadal leading 7\u20132 (3\u20130 at Wimbledon, 2\u20130 at the French Open, 1\u20131 at the Australian Open, and 1\u20131 at the US Open).[298] Seven of these nine appearances have been in quarterfinals and semifinals, making the rivalry an important part of both men's careers. Nadal defeated Murray in three consecutive Grand Slam semifinals in 2011 from the French Open to the US Open. They have never met in a Grand Slam final, but Murray leads 3\u20131 in ATP finals, with Nadal winning at Indian Wells in 2009[299] and Murray winning in Rotterdam the same year,[300]Tokyo[301] in 2011, and Madrid in 2015.\nNadal and Stan Wawrinka have met 20 times, with Nadal leading 17\u20133 (85.0%). Although this rivalry has less significance than rivalries with the other members of the Big Four, the pair have met in several prestigious tournaments. The rivalry saw Nadal winning the first 12 encounters, all in straight sets, including 2 finals, one of which is a Masters final at Madrid in 2013. However, since Wawrinka's breakthrough season in 2013 the pair has won an almost equal number of matches against each other (3\u20134) from 2014 onward.[302] Wawrinka scored his first win against Nadal in their most important encounter, the 2014 Australian Open final in 4 sets, denying Nadal's double career slam. It was also the only match between the pair not resulting in a straight set win for either player. Nadal won their second Grand Slam final, at the 2017 French Open.[303]\nNadal and compatriot David Ferrer met a total of 32 times, with the total record ending 26\u20136 (81.3%) in favor of Nadal with Ferrer's retirement. Nadal and Ferrer had met in several prestigious tournaments and important matches. Ferrer won their first meeting in 2004 in Stuttgart in 3 sets, but Nadal went on to win the next four until Ferrer defeated him in the 4th round of the 2007 US Open. The pair met in their first tournament final in 2008, in Barcelona, where Nadal won in three sets. They met a year later again in the Barcelona final, with Nadal taking the title in straight sets. In 2010, the pair met in their first Masters final in Rome, where Nadal won in straight sets. Ferrer, however, would get his revenge in the 2011 Australian Open quarterfinal, defeating Nadal in straight sets for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament.\nTheir biggest meeting, came in the 2013 French Open final. Ferrer was in his first major final, whereas Nadal was aiming for his 8th title at the French Open, and 13th overall. It was a straightforward victory for Nadal, 6\u20133, 6\u20132, 6\u20133. Between that meeting and 2015, Ferrer and Nadal would go on to play 6 more matches, with Nadal winning 4 of the 6.\nIn 2018, Ferrer announced that the US Open would be his last Grand Slam tournament, and he would retire the next year in the clay court season in Spain. Nadal and Ferrer had their first meeting since 2015 in the first round in the US Open. Ferrer's final match at a Grand Slam tournament, however, ended in injury as he was forced to retire in the 2nd set against Nadal. Yet, in his second to last tournament in Barcelona, he would have one more meeting with Nadal. Although it was a straight sets victory it was a close match until the end, with the resilient Ferrer fighting until the last point. The overall score was 6\u20133, 6\u20133 in the final match between the two before Ferrer's retirement at the 2019 Madrid Open.\nNadal and Juan Martin del Potro met 17 times, with Nadal leading 11\u20136 (64.7%). Outside the Big Four, no active player has more wins against Nadal than del Potro. The two met in many prestigious tournaments, including at three of the four majors and the Olympics. Nadal won their first four meetings between 2007 and 2009, before del Potro went on to win the next three, including a straight-sets victory at the 2009 US Open semifinals (he later went on to defeat Roger Federer in the final). Their next significant meeting came during the 2011 Davis Cup final. Nadal beat del Potro in four sets to claim the Davis Cup for Spain. In 2013, Nadal denied del Potro his first Masters title, with a victory in the final of the Indian Wells Masters. However, del Potro sought revenge in the semifinals of the 2016 Rio Olympics, narrowly beating Nadal via a third-set tie break.\nAfter a long span of injuries for both players, the pair met at a major for the first time since 2011 at the 2017 US Open. Del Potro, coming off of a four-set victory over Federer, had reached the semifinals of a major for the first time since 2013. However, Nadal defeated del Potro in four sets. The pair then met in three of the four majors in 2018, including a memorable match in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. The match went on for nearly five hours, with Nadal coming out on top, 7\u20135, 6\u20137, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20134. The pair met again at the 2018 US Open, where Nadal retired against del Potro in the semifinals. Del Potro then reached his first major final since his victory at the 2009 US Open, but lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic.\nNadal and Tomas Berdych met a total of 24 times, with Nadal leading 20\u20134 (83.3%). Although this rivalry is lopsided in favor of Nadal, the two had several close matches in prestigious tournaments. The pair met at 2 of the 4 Grand Slam tournaments, with 3 meetings at the Australian Open and 2 at Wimbledon, including the 2010 final. Nadal and Berdych first met in an ATP tournament in B\u00e5stad, where both men reached the final. Nadal won the match in 3 sets, in what was only his 8th title on the tour. Nadal and Berdych met a few more times in 2005\u201306, all in Masters tournaments. Out of their 4 matches, Berdych was able to win in 3, in Canada, Madrid, and Cincinnati. Their first meeting in a Grand Slam came at Wimbledon in 2007. They met in the quarterfinal round, where Nadal defeated Berdych in straight sets. Their next significant meeting was in the opening round of the 2009 Davis Cup Final, where Nadal again defeated Berdych in straight sets. Spain went on to win the Davis Cup that year.\nTheir next meeting in a final came at a Grand Slam, in Wimbledon. Nadal had reached his 4th Wimbledon final, in an attempt to win his second title. Berdych had reached his first Grand Slam final, defeating Roger Federer in 4 sets in the quarterfinal and Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the semifinal. However, the Spaniard was too good for the Czech in the final, and Nadal won in straight sets to take his 8th Grand Slam title. Their next meeting in a Grand Slam came only two years later in the 2012 Australian Open quarterfinal, where Nadal won in 4 tight sets. Nadal would later go on to lose the final to Djokovic in 5 sets. After multiple meetings from 2012 to 2014, all won by Nadal, the pair met again at the 2015 Australian Open quarterfinal. Here, after 18 straight losses over 9 years, Berdych was able to claim a win over Nadal, his only one in a Grand Slam against the Spaniard. Berdych won in straight sets, including a \"bagel\" (6\u20130) in the second. The two met later in 2015 in Madrid, where Nadal won in straight sets.\nAfter a gap of 4 years, Nadal and Berdych's last encounter was in the round of 16 at the 2019 Australian Open. After both players had prematurely ended their 2018 seasons with injuries, both had been playing very well in the 2019 season up to that point, with Berdych reaching the final in Doha. However, like many of their meetings, Nadal dominated the Czech and beat him in straight sets. Berdych retired at the end of the 2019 season.\nNadal is, without a doubt, the best athlete in the history of Spain. Spain has to pay him a tribute for many, many years. Nadal is the king of Roland Garros and of world tennis. He has achieved a record that is very difficult to beat.\n\u2014 Felipe VI, on Nadal's legacy after he won his 22nd Grand Slam at the French Open in 2022.[304]\nIn 2014, former tennis player and eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi picked Nadal as the greatest of all time because of the way the Spaniard \"had to deal with Federer, Djokovic, and Murray in a golden age of tennis\".[334] Nadal leads the head-to-head record at majors against the other members of the Big Three and holds the record for the most majors won beating a Big Three member en-route (13).\nNadal is one of two men, along with Agassi, to win the Olympic gold medal as well as the four majors in singles in his career, a feat known as a Career Golden Slam. He is the only male player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam and win an Olympic gold medal in both singles and doubles.[g] He is one of four men in history, along with Roy Emerson, Rod Laver and Djokovic, to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles.\nIn 2010, Nadal became the first man to achieve the Surface Slam by winning majors on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts) in the same calendar year. At the age of 24, he became the youngest player in the Open Era to complete the Career Grand Slam, and one of three men, along with Mats Wilander and Djokovic, to win at least two majors on each surface (Double Career Surface Slam). The same year, he became the only player in history to win all three Masters clay court tournaments (Monte-Carlo, Madrid, Rome) and the French Open in a calendar year, a feat known as a Clay Slam.[336] In 2017, Nadal achieved La D\u00e9cima (Spanish: the tenth) by becoming the first man with 10 titles at a single major, following similar feats at the Monte-Carlo Masters and Barcelona Open. In 2020, Nadal became the first player to win the French Open in three different decades.[citation needed] In 2022, he went on to become the first man to win multiple majors in three separate decades.\nIt is important to have true inner humility, not false humility, accepting that it's not always good, bad moments are better tolerated. People sometimes exaggerate this business of humility. It's simply a question of knowing who you are, where you are, and that the world will continue exactly as it is without you.\nNadal's playing style and personality has been described by Jimmy Connors: \"He's built out of a mold that I think I came from also, that you walk out there, you give everything you have from the first point to the end no matter what the score. And you're willing to lay it all out on the line and you're not afraid to let the people see that.\"\nNadal generally plays an aggressive, behind-the-baseline game founded on heavy topspin groundstrokes, consistency, speedy footwork and tenacious court coverage, thus making him an aggressive counterpuncher.[340] Known for his athleticism and speed around the court, Nadal is an excellent defender[341] who hits well on the run, constructing winning plays from seemingly defensive positions. He also plays very fine dropshots, which work especially well because his heavy topspin often forces opponents to the back of the court.[342]\nNadal hitting a forehand.\nNadal employs a semi-western grip forehand, often with a \"lasso-whip\" follow-through, where his left arm hits through the ball and finishes above his left shoulder \u2013 as opposed to a more traditional finish across the body or around his opposite shoulder.[343][344] Nadal's forehand groundstroke form allows him to hit shots with heavy topspin \u2013 more so than many of his contemporaries.[345]\nSan Francisco tennis researcher John Yandell used a high-speed video camera and special software to count the average number of revolutions of a tennis ball hit full force by Nadal. Yandell concluded:\nThe first guys we did were Sampras and Agassi. They were hitting forehands that in general were spinning about 1,800 to 1,900 revolutions per minute. Federer is hitting with an amazing amount of spin, too, right? 2,700 revolutions per minute. Well, we measured one forehand Nadal hit at 4,900. His average was 3,200.[346]\nWhile Nadal's shots tend to land short of the baseline, the characteristically high bounces his forehands achieve tend to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball.[347] Although his forehand is based on heavy topspin, he can hit the ball deep and flat with a more orthodox follow through for clean winners.\nNadal's serve was initially considered a weak point in his game, although his improvements in both first-serve points won and break points saved since 2005 have allowed him to consistently compete for and win major titles on faster surfaces. Nadal relies on the consistency of his serve to gain a strategic advantage in points, rather than going for service winners.[348] However, before the 2010 US Open, he altered his service motion, arriving in the trophy pose earlier and pulling the racket lower during the trophy pose. Before the 2010 US Open, Nadal modified his service grip to a more continental one. These two changes in his serve increased his average speed by around 10 mph during the 2010 US Open, maxing out at 135 mph (217 km/h), allowing him to win more free points on his serve.[349] Since the 2010 US Open, Nadal's serve speed dropped to previous levels and was again cited as in need of improvement.[350][351][352] From 2019 onwards, several analysts praised Nadal's improvement on the serve, noting the speed of his serve had increased.[353][354][355][356]\nAfter signing his new coach Carlos Moy\u00e1 in December 2016, Nadal's game style acquired a more offensive approach. Under Moy\u00e1's direction, Nadal improved his serve,[357][355] and incorporated serve-and-volley as a surprise tactic in some of his matches.[358]\nNadal is a clay court specialist, in the sense that he has been extremely successful on that surface. He has won 14 times at the French Open, 12 at Barcelona, 11 at Monte Carlo, and 10 at Rome. However, Nadal has shed that label owing to his success on other surfaces, including holding simultaneous Grand Slam tournament titles on grass, hard courts, and clay on two separate occasions, winning ten Masters titles on hard court, and winning an Olympic gold medal on hard court.[340][359]\nDespite praise for Nadal's talent and skill, in the past, some had questioned his longevity in the sport, citing his build and playing style as conducive to injury.[360] Nadal himself has admitted to the physical toll hard courts place on ATP Tour players, calling for a reevaluated tour schedule featuring fewer hard court tournaments.[361] This \"longevity\" narrative has proven inaccurate, and pundits today admire his resilience.[362]\nIn an interview in CBS's 60 Minutes in May 2021, Nadal said he has never broken a racket with anger in a match.[366] He added that his family does not approve of it and breaking a racket means he is not in control of his emotions.\nNadal has been sponsored by Kia Motors since 2006. He has appeared in advertising campaigns for Kia as a global ambassador for the company. In May 2008, Kia released a claymation viral ad featuring Nadal in a tennis match with an alien. In May 2015, Nadal extended his partnership with Kia for another five years.[372]\nNadal wearing his signature Nike sleeveless shirt at the French Open in 2007, while holding his Babolat racquet\nNike serves as Nadal's clothing and shoe sponsor. Nadal's signature on-court attire entailed a variety of sleeveless shirts paired with 3/4 length capri pants.[373] For the 2009 season, Nadal adopted more-traditional on-court apparel. Nike encouraged Nadal to update his look in order to reflect his new status as the sport's top player at that time[374] and associate Nadal with a style that, while less distinctive than his \"pirate\" look, would be more widely emulated by consumers.[375][376] At warmup tournaments in Abu Dhabi and Doha, Nadal played matches in a polo shirt specifically designed for him by Nike,[377] paired with shorts cut above the knee. Nadal's new, more conventional style carried over to the 2009 Australian Open, where he was outfitted with Nike's Bold Crew Men's Tee[378] and Nadal Long Check Shorts.[379][380][381] Nadal wears Nike's Air CourtBallistec 2.3 tennis shoes,[382] bearing various customizations throughout the season, including his nickname \"Rafa\" on the right shoe and a stylized bull logo on the left.\nHe became the face of Lanvin'sL'Homme Sport cologne in April 2009.[383] Nadal uses an AeroPro Drive racquet with a 4+1\u20444-inch L2 grip. As of the 2010 season[update], Nadal's racquets are painted to resemble the new Babolat AeroPro Drive with Cortex GT racquet in order to market a current model which Babolat sells.[384][385] Nadal uses no replacement grip, and instead wraps two overgrips around the handle. He used Duralast 15L strings until the 2010 season, when he switched to Babolat's new, black-colored, RPM Blast string. Nadal's rackets are always strung at 55 lb (25 kg), regardless of which surface or conditions he is playing on.[citation needed]\nAs of January 2010[update], Nadal is the international ambassador for Quely, a company from his native Mallorca that manufactures biscuits, bakery and chocolate-coated products; he has consumed their products ever since he was a young child.[386]\nIn 2010, luxury watchmaker Richard Mille announced that he had developed an ultra-light wristwatch in collaboration with Nadal called the Richard Mille RM027 Tourbillon watch.[387] The watch is made of titanium and lithium and is valued at US$525,000; Nadal was involved in the design and testing of the watch on the tennis court.[387] During the 2010 French Open, Men's Fitness reported that Nadal wore the Richard Mille watch on the court as part of a sponsorship deal with the Swiss watchmaker.[388]\nNadal replaced Cristiano Ronaldo as the new face of Emporio Armani Underwear and Armani Jeans for the spring/summer 2011 collection.[389] This was the first time that the label has chosen a tennis player for the job; association football has ruled lately prior to Ronaldo, David Beckham graced the ads since 2008.[390] Armani said that he selected Nadal as his latest male underwear model because \"...he is ideal as he represents a healthy and positive model for youngsters\".[389]\nIn June 2012, Nadal joined the group of sports endorsers of the PokerStarsonline poker cardroom.[391] Nadal won a charity poker tournament against retired Brazilian football player Ronaldo in 2014.[392]\nIn August 2023, Nadal signed up as the brand ambassador for the Indian IT major Infosys.[393] Rafael said: \"I\u2019m very happy to work closely with Infosys, as they work to not only evolve the experience of tennis to the times, but also empower people in our communities to be part of a brighter future.\"\nIn April 2017, the centre court of the Barcelona Open was named Pista Rafa Nadal.[394] In 2021, prior to the start of tournament, the French Open paid tribute to Nadal with the installation of a 3-meters tall steel statue at Stade Roland Garros.[395] It was created by Jordi D\u00edez Fern\u00e1ndez, one of Spain's most renowned sculptors.[395]\nNadal's autobiography, Rafa (Hyperion, 2012, ISBN1-4013-1092-3), written with assistance from John Carlin, was published in August 2011.[396] In February 2010, Rafael Nadal was featured in the music video of Shakira's \"Gypsy\".[397] and part of her album release She Wolf. In explaining why she chose Nadal for the video, Shakira was quoted as saying in an interview with the Latin American Herald Tribune: \"I thought that maybe I needed someone I could in some way identify with. And Rafael Nadal is a person who has been totally committed to his career since he was very young. Since he was 17, I believe.\"[398][399]\nNadal owns and trains at the Rafa Nadal Sports Centre (40,000 m2, 430,000 sq ft) in his hometown of Manacor, Mallorca. The centre houses the Rafa Nadal Tennis Academy, where the American International School of Mallorca is located.[402] Also located in the centre is a sports residence, a Rafael Nadal museum, a health clinic, a fitness centre with spa and a caf\u00e9. The facility has 26 tennis courts among its sporting areas.[402]\nNadal also owns and operates three other similar Rafa Nadal Academy/Centre facilities in Al Zahra, Kuwait (called the Rafa Nadal Academy Kuwait),[403]Canc\u00fan, Mexico (called the Rafa Nadal Tennis Centre Mexico),[404] and Chalkidiki, Greece (called the Rafa Nadal Tennis Centre Greece).[405] The Mexico and Greece Centres started operations in 2019 while the Kuwait Academy opened in 2020.[406]\nNadal took part in Thailand's \"A Million Trees for the King\" project, planting a tree in honour of King Bhumibol Adulyadej on a visit to Hua Hin during his Thailand Open 2010. \"For me it's an honour to be part of this project\", said Nadal. \"It's a very good project. I want to congratulate the Thai people and congratulate the King for this unbelievable day. I wish all the best for this idea. It's very, very nice.\"[407]\nThe creation of the Fundaci\u00f3n Rafa Nadal took place in November 2007, and its official presentation was in February 2008, at the Manacor Tennis Club in Mallorca, Spain. The foundation will focus on social work and development aid particularly on childhood and youth.[408] On deciding why to start a foundation, Nadal said \"This can be the beginning of my future, when I retire and have more time, [...] I am doing very well and I owe society, [...] A month-and-a-half ago I was in Chennai, in India. The truth is we live great here....I can contribute something with my image...\" Nadal was inspired by the Red Cross benefit match against malaria with Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, recalling, \"We raised an amount of money that we would never have imagined. I have to thank Iker, my project partner, who went all out for it, [...] That is why the time has come to set up my own foundation and determine the destination of the money.\"\nNadal's mother, Ana Mar\u00eda Parera, chairs the charitable organization and father Sebastian is vice-chairman. Coach and uncle Toni Nadal and his agent, former tennis player Carlos Costa, are also involved. Roger Federer has given Nadal advice on getting involved in philanthropy. Despite the fact that poverty in India struck him particularly hard, Nadal wants to start by helping \"people close by, in the Balearic Islands, in Spain, and then, if possible, abroad\".[409]\nRafael Nadal opened his tennis academy centre to Majorca flood victims in October 2018.[412] By that time he was recovering at home in Majorca, shortly after having to leave the US Open due to injury and one day after the flood he worked personally with some friends to help the victims.[413][414]\nLater, Nadal donated \u20ac1 million for rebuilding Sant Lloren\u00e7 des Cardassar, the most affected town by the floods in the island.[415][416] Nadal also organized other charitable activities to help repair the damage of the disaster, such as the Olaz\u00e1bal & Nadal charity golf tournament[417][418] and a charity tennis match in which he was going to participate and that had to be suspended because he had to have an operation on an ankle injury,[419] later identified as Mueller-Weiss Syndrome.[420]\nNadal supports or has supported other charities, such as City Harvest, Elton John AIDS Foundation, Laureus Sport for Good Foundation and Small Steps Project.[421]\nShortly after acquiring his interest in Mallorca, Nadal called out UEFA for apparent hypocrisy in ejecting the club from the 2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League for excessive debts, saying through a club spokesperson, \"Well, if those are the criteria upon which UEFA is operating, then European competition will only comprise two or three clubs because all the rest are in debt, too.\"[424]\nNadal lived with his parents and younger sister Mar\u00eda Isabel in a five-storey apartment building in their hometown of Manacor, Mallorca. In June 2009, Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia, and then The New York Times, reported that his parents, Ana Mar\u00eda and Sebasti\u00e1n, had separated. This news came after weeks of speculation in Internet posts and message boards over Nadal's personal issues as the cause of his setback.[425] Nadal has been in a relationship with Mar\u00eda Francisca (Mery) Perell\u00f3 Pascual[426] (often mistakenly[427] referred to as Xisca in the press)[428] since 2005, and their engagement was reported in January 2019.[429] The couple married in October 2019.[430] On 8 October 2022, they welcomed their first child, a son named Rafael.[431][432]\nIn addition to tennis and football, Nadal enjoys playing golf and poker.[435] In April 2014, he played the world's No. 1 female poker player, Vanessa Selbst, in a poker game in Monaco.[436] In October 2020, Nadal competed in the professional-level Balearic Golf Championship,[437] obtaining a World Amateur Golf Ranking in the process.[438]\nAs a young boy, he would run home from school to watch Goku in his favorite Japanese anime, Dragon Ball. CNN released an article about Nadal's childhood inspiration, and called him \"the Dragon Ball of tennis\" owing to his unorthodox style \"from another planet\".[439]\nDespite playing tennis left-handed, Nadal is known for being right-handed while doing things in everyday life such as writing and playing golf.[440]\nIn 2021, Nadal announced that he had a rare chronic disorder of his left ankle, Mueller-Weiss syndrome.[441] He was diagnosed at the age of 19 and held off surgery as long as he could.[442] After surgery in 2021, he returned to tennis in early 2022, winning the Australian Open. He later received two numbing injections and anti-inflammatories before each of his seven matches en route to winning the 2022 French Open.[443] Nadal stated that he was not willing to do this again. In an open statement regarding his injury, he said, \"I am not injured, I am a player living with an injury.\"[443]\n^ abNadal withdrew before the third round of the 2016 French Open due to a wrist injury, and before the semi-finals of 2022 Wimbledon due to an abdominal tear which do not officially count as losses.\n^Nadal received a walkover in the second round of the 2019 US Open, which does not count as a win.\nNadal's 22 Grand Slam singles titles place him second in the men's all-time rankings, behind Djokovic's 24 titles. His 30 Grand Slam singles finals place him 3rd in the men's all-time rankings, behind Djokovic's 36 and Federer's 31 finals, respectively. He has won 14 French Open titles, an all-time record at any tournament. He is the youngest player in the Open Era to win all four majors (24 years old).",

        "effective_year": "before 2022",
        "context": "\nThe office of Chancellor has a long history, stemming back to the Holy Roman Empire, when the office of German archchancellor was usually held by archbishops of Mainz. The title was, at times, used in several states of German-speaking Europe. The modern office of chancellor was established with the North German Confederation, of which Otto von Bismarck became Bundeskanzler (meaning \"Federal Chancellor\") in 1867. With the enlargement of this federal state to the German Empire in 1871, the title was renamed to Reichskanzler (meaning \"Imperial Chancellor\"). With Germany's constitution of 1949, the title of Bundeskanzler was revived.\nIn 1559, Emperor Ferdinand I established the agency of an imperial chancellery (Reichshofkanzlei) at the Vienna Hofburg Palace, headed by a vice chancellor under the nominal authority of the Mainz archbishop. Upon the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, Emperor Ferdinand II created the office of an Austrian court chancellor in charge of the internal and foreign affairs of the Habsburg monarchy. From 1753 onwards, the office of an Austrian state chancellor was held by Prince Kaunitz. The imperial chancellery lost its importance, and from the days of Maria Theresa and Joseph II, merely existed on paper. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Prince Metternich served as state chancellor of the Austrian Empire (1821\u20131848), likewise Prince Hardenberg acted as Prussian chancellor (1810\u20131822). The German Confederation of 1815\u20131866 did not have a government or parliament, only the Bundestag as representative organ of the states.\nThe role of the chancellor has varied during the different eras. From 1867 to 1918, the chancellor was the only responsible minister at the federal level. He was appointed by the Bundespr\u00e4sidium, (i.e. the Prussian king; since 1871 called Emperor). The state secretaries (Staatssekret\u00e4re) were civil servants subordinate to the chancellor and similar to ministers. Besides his executive duties, the constitution gave the chancellor only one function: presiding over the Bundesrat (Federal Council), the representative organ of the states (which together with the Reichstag was the Reich's lawmaking body). The chancellor was also nearly always minister president of Prussia. Indirectly, this gave him the power of the Bundesrat, including to dissolve parliament.\nAlthough effective government was possible only in cooperation with the Reichstag, the results of the elections had at most an indirect influence on the chancellorship. Only in October 1918 was the constitution changed to require that the chancellor have the trust of parliament. Some two weeks later, Chancellor Max von Baden declared the abdication of the emperor and, although he lacked the constitutional authority, handed over his office to Friedrich Ebert of the revolutionary Council of the People's Deputies.\nAccording to the Weimar Constitution of 1919, the chancellor was head of a collegial government. The chancellor was appointed by the Reich president, as were the ministers, on the chancellor's recommendation. The chancellor or any minister had to be dismissed if the Reichstag demanded it. As today, the chancellor had the prerogative to determine the guidelines of government. In reality this power was limited by the needs of coalition governments and the powers of the Reich president.\nWhen the Nazis came to power on 30 January 1933, the Weimar Constitution was de facto set aside. After the death of President Hindenburg in 1934, Adolf Hitler, the dictatorial party leader and chancellor, took over the powers of the president. The new official title became F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler (meaning \"Leader and Imperial Chancellor\").\nThe 1949 constitution gave the chancellor much greater powers than during the Weimar Republic, while strongly diminishing the role of the president. Germany is today often referred to as a \"chancellor democracy\", reflecting the role of the chancellor as the country's chief executive.\nSince 1867, 33 individuals have served as heads of government of Germany, West Germany, or Northern Germany, nearly all of them with the title of Chancellor.\nUnder the constitution of 1 January 1871, the king had the additional title of Emperor. The constitution still called the chancellor Bundeskanzler. This was changed in the new constitution of 16 April 1871 to Reichskanzler. Since the office remained the same, it was not necessary for Bismarck to be re-appointed.\nIn the 1871 German Empire, the Reichskanzler (\"Imperial Chancellor\") served both as the emperor's first minister and as presiding officer of the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the German parliament. He was neither elected by nor responsible to Parliament (the Reichstag). Instead, the chancellor was appointed by the emperor.\nThe federal level had four organs:\nthe king of Prussia in his federal constitutional role as bearer of the Bundespr\u00e4sidium, since 1871 with the title of emperor\nthe federal council (Bundesrat), consisting of representatives of the federal states and presided over by the chancellor\nTechnically, the foreign ministers of the empire's states instructed their states' deputies to the Bundesrat and therefore outranked the chancellor. For this reason, Prince Bismarck (as he was from 1871 onwards) continued to serve as both minister president and foreign minister of Prussia for virtually his entire tenure as chancellor of the empire, since he wanted to continue to exercise the power. Because Prussia controlled seventeen votes in the Bundesrat, Bismarck could effectively control the proceedings by making deals with the smaller states.\nThe term chancellor signalled the seemingly low priority of this institution compared to the governments of the German states, because the new chancellor of the federal empire should not be a full-fledged prime minister, in contrast to the heads of the states. The title of chancellor additionally symbolized a strong monarchist, bureaucratic, and ultimately antiparliamentary component, as in the Prussian tradition of, for instance, Hardenberg.\nIn both of these aspects, the executive of the federation, and then empire, as it was formed in 1867 and 1871, was deliberately different from the Imperial Ministry of the revolutionary years 1848\u201349, which had been led by a prime minister elected by the National Assembly.\nIn 1871, the concept of the federal chancellor was transferred to the executive of the newly formed German Empire, which now also contained the South German states. Here too, the terms of \"chancellor\" and \"federal agency\" (as opposed to \"ministry\" or \"government\") suggested an (apparent) lower priority of the federal executive as compared to the governments of the federal states. For this reason, neither the chancellor nor the leaders of the imperial departments under his command used the title of Minister until 1918.\nOn 9 November 1918, Chancellor Max von Baden handed over his office of chancellor to Friedrich Ebert. Ebert continued to serve as head of government during the three months between the end of the German Empire in November 1918 and the first gathering of the Weimar National Assembly in February 1919, but did not use the title of chancellor.\nThe office of chancellor (Reichskanzler) was continued in the Weimar Republic. The Weimar Constitution provided for a two-part executive consisting of a Reich president and a government made up of Reich ministers and a Reich chancellor (Article 52)[4] who determined the guidelines of the government's policy (Article 56).[4]\nThe constitution stipulated that the president appoint and dismiss the chancellor and ministers. The ministers were appointed by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor (Article 53),[4] and members of the government required the confidence of the Reichstag (Article 54).[4] The provisions gave rise to the question of who in fact was responsible for forming the government.\nConstitutional law expert Ernst Rudolf Huber said that the constitution had tacitly assumed that the president would have discussions with party leaders in the Reichstag before he made ministerial appointments. Based on these talks, the president would get a sense of which potential chancellor would be able to build a stable majority in the Reichstag. According to the sense of the Weimar Constitution, the president was thus to have the initiative.[5] The task of putting together the Reich government was nevertheless the responsibility of the chancellor. The president could not appoint anyone as minister whom the chancellor had not proposed.\nThe chancellor alone had to answer to the Reichstag and the president for the policy guidelines, and he determined whether the conduct of business by the individual Reich ministries conformed to the guidelines. The government's decisions required a majority vote of the ministers, who sitting together were known as the National Ministry (Article 58).[4] The chancellor could therefore be outvoted, as could a department minister. The chancellor presided over the government, and he had to conduct business in accordance with given rules of procedure.[6][7]\nIn practice the Reich chancellor's power to determine political guidelines was limited by his own party as well as the other parties in the governing coalition. The Weimar chancellors were accordingly men whose strength lay in mediation rather than political initiative.[8] Constitutionally, there was also the fact that the president had certain special rights. The actions of the president required the countersignature of the chancellor or the minister or ministers concerned, but the president always had to be informed about matters of foreign and defense policy.\nThe Reichstag could call for the dismissal of any member of the government, including the chancellor. Under Articles 54 and 59,[4] the Reichstag could also impeach the chancellor as well as the ministers and the president before the State Court for the German Reich (Staatsgerichtshof f\u00fcr das Deutsche Reich), the Weimar Republic's constitutional court.\nAdolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 by Paul von Hindenburg. On taking office, Hitler immediately began accumulating power and changing the nature of the chancellorship. After only two months in office, and following the burning of the Reichstag building, the parliament passed the Enabling Act giving the chancellor full legislative powers for a period of four years \u2013 the chancellor could introduce any law without consulting Parliament. The powers of the chancellor continued to grow until August 1934, when the incumbent President Paul von Hindenburg died. Hitler used the Enabling Act to merge the office of chancellor with that of the president to create a new office, \"the leader\" (or F\u00fchrer).\nAlthough the offices were merged, Hitler continued to be addressed as \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\" indicating that the head of state and head of government were still separate positions, albeit held by the same person, although the title of \"Reichskanzler\" was quietly dropped. This separation was made more evident when, in April 1945, Hitler gave instruction that upon his death, the office of the F\u00fchrer would dissolve and be replaced by the previous system of administration: that of the office of the President separate from that of Chancellor. On 30 April 1945, when Hitler committed suicide, he was briefly succeeded as Chancellor by Joseph Goebbels and as President of Germany by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz. When Goebbels also committed suicide, D\u00f6nitz appointed Count Schwerin von Krosigk as head of government with the title \"Leading Minister\".\nThe 1949 German constitution, the Basic Law (Grundgesetz), invests the chancellor (German, Bundeskanzler) with broad powers to initiate government policy. For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a \"chancellor democracy\". Even though the office of chancellor is often considered the most powerful in the German political system and is seen as such within the German public, it is only the third highest office, following the head of state, the President of Germany, and the President of the Bundestag, a position similar to the speaker of the federal parliament.\nWhichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election \"chancellor-candidate\" (Kanzlerkandidat). The federal government (Bundesregierung) consists of the chancellor and cabinet ministers.\nThe cabinet bench in the Reichstag building (to the left of the flag) with the raised seat of the chancellor in the front row\nThe chancellor's authority emanates from the provisions of the Basic Law and in practice from their status as leader of the party (or coalition of parties) holding a majority of seats in the Bundestag (federal parliament). With the exception of Helmut Schmidt and Olaf Scholz, the chancellor has also been chairman of their own party. This was the case with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der from 1999 until he resigned the chairmanship of the SPD in 2004.\nThe first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, set many precedents that continue today and established the chancellorship as the clear focus of power in Germany. Under the provisions of the Basic Law giving him the power to set guidelines for all fields of policy, Adenauer arrogated nearly all major decisions to himself. He often treated his ministers as mere extensions of his authority rather than colleagues. While his successors have tended to be less domineering, the chancellor has acquired enough ex officio authority (in addition to his/her constitutional powers) that Germany is often described by constitutional law experts as a \"chancellor democracy\".\nThe chancellor determines the composition of the Federal Cabinet. The president formally appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers, on the recommendation of the chancellor; no parliamentary approval is needed. According to the Basic Law, the chancellor may set the number of cabinet ministers and dictate their specific duties. Chancellor Ludwig Erhard had the largest cabinet, with 22 ministers, in the mid-1960s. Helmut Kohl presided over 17 ministers at the start of his fourth term in 1994; the 2002 cabinet, the second of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, had 13 ministers, and the Angela Merkel cabinet as of 22 November 2005 had 15.\nArticle 65 of the Basic Law sets forth three principles that define how the executive branch functions:\nThe \"chancellor principle\" makes the chancellor responsible for all government policies; this is also known as the Richtlinienkompetenz (roughly translated as \"guideline setting competence\"). Any formal policy guidelines issued by the chancellor are legally binding directives that cabinet ministers must implement. Cabinet ministers are expected to introduce specific policies at the ministerial level that reflect the chancellor's broader guidelines.\nThe \"principle of ministerial autonomy\" entrusts each minister with the freedom to supervise departmental operations and prepare legislative proposals without cabinet interference so long as the minister's policies are consistent with the chancellor's broader guidelines.\nThe \"cabinet principle\" calls for disagreements between federal ministers over jurisdictional or budgetary matters to be settled by the cabinet.\nThe chancellor is elected by the Bundestag and formally appointed by the president of Germany. A chancellor's election is necessary whenever the office of Chancellor has fallen vacant. This is the case if a newly elected Bundestag meets for the first time, or if the chancellor dies or resigns.\nThe chancellor's election (in the first two voting phases) is one of the few cases in which a vote in the Bundestag requires a majority of all elected members, not just a majority of those assembled at the time, or the so-called Kanzlermehrheit (\"chancellor majority\"). As with other elections performed by the Bundestag, the chancellor is elected via secret ballot. The process begins with the President of Germany proposing a candidate to the Bundestag (A formality, as they are usually a candidate on which majority parties have agreed to beforehand), who is then voted upon without debate (\"1st voting phase\"). If this nominee is not elected, the parliamentary groups in the Bundestag may, during the following 14 days, propose their own nominees, who also have to be elected with the \"chancellor-majority\" (\"2nd voting phase\"). If no chancellor has been elected within this period, the Bundestag will hold one last ballot on the 15th day after the first ballot, to which (like in the 2nd voting phase) the parliamentary groups may put forward candidates (\"3rd voting phase\"). A candidate reaching the \"chancellor majority\" in any voting phase, must be appointed by the President of Germany. However, if on the last ballot no candidate reaches this threshold, the president is free to either appoint as chancellor the candidate who received a plurality of votes here (de facto allowing formation of a minority government) or call new elections for the Bundestag within 60 days.[9]\nAnother possibility to vote a new chancellor into office is the constructive vote of no confidence, which allows the Bundestag to replace a sitting chancellor, if it elects a new chancellor with the \"chancellor-majority\" (see below).\nAs of 2023, all chancellors of the federal republic have been (re-)elected on proposal of the President and on the first ballot with the sole exception of Helmut Kohl, who was elected to his first term via a constructive vote of no confidence against Helmut Schmidt.\nUnlike in other parliamentary legislatures, the Bundestag cannot remove the chancellor with a traditional motion of no confidence. Instead, the removal of a chancellor is only possible if a majority of the Bundestag members agree on a successor, who is then immediately sworn in as new chancellor. This procedure is called \"constructive motion of no confidence\" (konstruktives Misstrauensvotum) and was created to avoid the situation that existed in the Weimar Republic, when it was easier to gather a parliament majority willing to remove a government in office than to find a majority capable of supporting a new stable government.[10]\nIn order to garner legislative support in the Bundestag, the chancellor can also ask for a motion of confidence (Vertrauensfrage, literally \"question of trust\"), either combined with a legislative proposal or as a standalone vote. If such a vote fails, the chancellor may ask the president for the dissolution of the Bundestag; he or she is however not bound to do so, and the president in turn is not bound to follow this request.\nThe chancellor must appoint one of the cabinet ministers as vice chancellor (Article 69.1 Basic Law). The vice chancellor may deputise for the chancellor, if they are absent or unable to perform their duties. Although the chancellor is theoretically free to choose any cabinet minister, in coalition governments the leadership of the second biggest coalition party usually designates one of their ministers for the position, whom the chancellor appoints accordingly.\nIf the chancellor's term in office ends or if they resign, the Bundestag has to elect a new chancellor. The president of Germany may ask the former chancellor to act as chancellor until a new office holder is elected, but if they are unwilling or unable to do so, the president may also appoint the vice chancellor as acting chancellor. This has happened once: On 7 May 1974 Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned as a consequence of the Guillaume affair, an espionage scandal. In his letter of resignation to President Gustav Heinemann he requested, to be not asked to remain in office in an acting capacity and instead to appoint the vice chancellor as acting chancellor.[11] President Heinemann followed the request. Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel was appointed acting chancellor and served for nine days until the election of Helmut Schmidt on 16 May 1974.\nThe private lodging of the chancellors at Bonn has previously been the Chancellor's bungalow built by Ludwig Erhard in the park of Palais Schaumburg, while his predecessor Konrad Adenauer used to live in his private house near Bonn. Under Adenauer, the government had also acquired a villa in Dahlem in 1962, a suburban district of southwestern Berlin, as a pied-a-terre of the chancellors in West-Berlin. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der lived there between 1999 and 2001. Since 2004 it has however served as a private residence for the Presidents of Germany. Angela Merkel preferred to live with her husband in her private apartment downtown.\nThe correct style of address in German is Herr Bundeskanzler (male) or Frau Bundeskanzlerin (female). In international correspondence, the chancellor is referred to as \"His/Her Excellency the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany\" (\"Seine/Ihre Exzellenz der Bundeskanzler/die Bundeskanzlerin der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\").[1]\nHolding the third-highest state office available within Germany, the chancellor of Germany receives \u20ac220,000 per annum and a \u20ac22,000 bonus, i.e. one and two thirds of Salary Grade B11 (according to \u00a7 11 (1) a of the Federal Law on Ministers \u2013 Bundesministergesetz, BGBl. 1971 I p. 1166 and attachment IV to the Federal Law on Salaries of Officers \u2013 Bundesbesoldungsgesetz, BGBl. 2002 I p. 3020)[12]\n^It is unclear whether and from when Erhard was formally a member of the CDU; however, he was a member of the CDU/CSU group in the German Bundestag throughout his chancellorship and was chairman of the CDU from 23 March 1966 \u2013 23 May 1967, which implies membership at least during this period.",

        "context": "\nThe members of the Bundestag are representatives of the German people as a whole, are not bound by any orders or instructions and are only accountable to their electorate.[e] The minimum legal number of members of the Bundestag (German: Mitglieder des Bundestages) is 598;[f] however, due to the system of overhang and leveling seats the current 20th Bundestag has a total of 736 members, making it the largest Bundestag to date and the largest freely elected national parliamentary chamber in the world.[2]\nWith the new constitution of 1949, the Bundestag was established as the new West German parliament. Because West Berlin was not officially under the jurisdiction of the constitution, a legacy of the Cold War, the Bundestag met in Bonn in several different buildings, including (provisionally) a former waterworks facility. In addition, owing to the city's legal status, citizens of West Berlin were unable to vote in elections to the Bundestag, and were instead represented by 22 non-voting delegates[6] chosen by the House of Representatives, the city's legislature.[7]\nThe Bundeshaus in Bonn is the former parliament building of Germany. The sessions of the German Bundestag were held there from 1949 until its move to Berlin in 1999. Today it houses the International Congress Centre Bundeshaus Bonn and in the northern areas the branch office of the Bundesrat (\"Federal Council\"), which represents the L\u00e4nder \u2013 the federated states. The southern areas became part of German offices for the United Nations in 2008.[8]\nThe former Reichstag building housed a history exhibition (Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte) and served occasionally as a conference center. The Reichstag building was also occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the Federal Convention, the body which elects the German federal president. However, the Soviets harshly protested against the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and tried to disturb the sittings by flying supersonic jets close to the building.[citation needed]\nSince 19 April 1999, the German parliament has again assembled in Berlin in its original Reichstag building, which was built in 1888 based on the plans of German architect Paul Wallot and underwent a significant renovation under the lead of British architect Lord Norman Foster. Parliamentary committees and subcommittees, public hearings and parliamentary group meetings take place in three auxiliary buildings, which surround the Reichstag building: the Jakob-Kaiser-Haus, Paul-L\u00f6be-Haus and Marie-Elisabeth-L\u00fcders-Haus.[citation needed]\nIn 2005, a small aircraft crashed close to the German Parliament. It was then decided to ban private air traffic over Central Berlin.[9]\nAlthough most legislation is initiated by the executive branch, the Bundestag considers the legislative function its most important responsibility, concentrating much of its energy on assessing and amending the government's legislative program. The committees (see below) play a prominent role in this process. Plenary sessions provide a forum for members to engage in public debate on legislative issues before them, but they tend to be well attended only when significant legislation is being considered.\nThe Bundestag members are the only federal officials directly elected by the public; the Bundestag in turn elects the chancellor and, in addition, exercises oversight of the executive branch on issues of both substantive policy and routine administration. This check on executive power can be employed through binding legislation, public debates on government policy, investigations, and direct questioning of the chancellor or cabinet officials. For example, the Bundestag can conduct a question hour (Fragestunde), in which a government representative responds to a written question previously submitted by a member. Members can ask related questions during the question hour. The questions can concern anything from a major policy issue to a specific constituent's problem. Use of the question hour has increased markedly over the past forty years, with more than 20,000 questions being posed during the 1987\u201390 term. The opposition parties actively exercise their parliamentary right to scrutinize government actions.\nConstituent services also take place via the Petition Committee. In 2004, the Petition Committee received over 18,000 complaints from citizens and was able to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution to more than half of them. In 2005, as a pilot of the potential of internet petitions, a version of e-petitioner was produced for the Bundestag. This was a collaborative project involving The Scottish Parliament, International Teledemocracy Centre and the Bundestag 'Online Services Department'. The system was formally launched on 1 September 2005, and in 2008 the Bundestag moved to a new system based on its evaluation.[10]\nThe Bundestag is elected for four years, and new elections must be held between 46 and 48 months after the beginning of its electoral term, unless the Bundestag is dissolved prematurely. Its term ends when the next Bundestag convenes, which must occur within 30 days of the election.[11] Prior to 1976, there could be a period where one Bundestag had been dissolved and the next Bundestag could not be convened; during this period, the rights of the Bundestag were exercised by a so-called \"Permanent Committee\".[12]\nEvery elector has two votes: a constituency vote (first vote) and a party list vote (second vote). Based solely on the first votes, 299 members are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. The second votes are used to produce a proportional number of seats for parties, first in the states, and then on the federal level. Seats are allocated using the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb method. If a party wins fewer constituency seats in a state than its second votes would entitle it to, it receives additional seats from the relevant state list. Parties can file lists in every single state under certain conditions \u2013 for example, a fixed number of supporting signatures. Parties can receive second votes only in those states in which they have filed a state list.[13]\nIf a party, by winning single-member constituencies in one state, receives more seats than it would be entitled to according to its second vote share in that state (so-called overhang seats), the other parties receive compensation seats. Owing to this provision, the Bundestag usually has more than 598 members. The 20th and current Bundestag, for example, has 736 seats: 598 regular seats and 138 overhang and compensation seats. Overhang seats are calculated at the state level, so many more seats are added to balance this out among the different states, adding more seats than would be needed to compensate for overhang at the national level in order to avoid negative vote weight.[13]\nTo qualify for seats based on the party-list vote share, a party must either win three single-member constituencies via first votes (basic mandate clause) or exceed a threshold of 5% of the second votes nationwide. If a party only wins one or two single-member constituencies and fails to get at least 5% of the second votes, it keeps the single-member seat(s), but other parties that accomplish at least one of the two threshold conditions receive compensation seats.[13] In the most recent example of this, during the 2002 election, the PDS won only 4.0% of the second votes nationwide, but won two constituencies in the state of Berlin.[14] The same applies if an independent candidate wins a single-member constituency,[13] which has not happened since the 1949 election.[14]\nIf a voter cast a first vote for a successful independent candidate or a successful candidate whose party failed to qualify for proportional representation, their second vote does not count toward proportional representation. However, it does count toward whether the elected party exceeds the 5% threshold.[13]\nBundestag ballot from the 2005 election in the W\u00fcrzburg district. The column for the constituency vote (with the name, occupation, and address of each candidate) is on the left in black print; the column for the party list vote (showing top five list candidates in the state) is on the right in blue print.\nThe most important organisational structures within the Bundestag are parliamentary groups (Fraktionen; sing. Fraktion). A parliamentary group must consist of at least 5% of all members of parliament. Members of parliament from different parties may only join in a group if those parties did not run against each other in any German state during the election. Normally, all parties that surpassed the 5%-threshold build a parliamentary group. The CDU and CSU have always formed a single united Fraktion (CDU/CSU), which is possible, as the CSU only runs in the state of Bavaria and the CDU only runs in the other 15 states. The size of a party's Fraktion determines the extent of its representation on committees, the time slots allotted for speaking, the number of committee chairs it can hold, and its representation in executive bodies of the Bundestag. The Fraktionen, not the members, receive the bulk of government funding for legislative and administrative activities.\nThe leadership of each Fraktion consists of a parliamentary party leader, several deputy leaders, and an executive committee. The leadership's major responsibilities are to represent the Fraktion, enforce party discipline and orchestrate the party's parliamentary activities. The members of each Fraktion are distributed among working groups focused on specific policy-related topics such as social policy, economics, and foreign policy. The Fraktion meets every Tuesday afternoon in the weeks in which the Bundestag is in session to consider legislation before the Bundestag and formulate the party's position on it.\nParties that do not hold 5% of the Bundestag-seats may be granted the status of a Gruppe (literally \"group\", but a different status from Fraktion) in the Bundestag; this is decided case by case, as the rules of procedure do not state a fixed number of seats for this. Most recently, this applied to the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) from 1990 to 1998. This status entails some privileges which are in general less than those of a Fraktion.\nThe Bundestag's executive bodies include the Council of Elders and the Presidium. The council consists of the Bundestag leadership, together with the most senior representatives of each Fraktion, with the number of these representatives tied to the strength of the Parliamentary groups in the chamber. The council is the coordination hub, determining the daily legislative agenda and assigning committee chairpersons based on Parliamentary group representation. The council also serves as an important forum for interparty negotiations on specific legislation and procedural issues. The Presidium is responsible for the routine administration of the Bundestag, including its clerical and research activities. It consists of the chamber's president (usually elected from the largest Fraktion) and vice presidents (one from each Fraktion).\nMost of the legislative work in the Bundestag is the product of standing committees, which exist largely unchanged throughout one legislative period. The number of committees approximates the number of federal ministries, and the titles of each are roughly similar (e.g., defense, agriculture, and labor). There are, as of the current nineteenth Bundestag, 24 standing committees. The distribution of committee chairs and the membership of each committee reflect the relative strength of the various Parliamentary groups in the chamber. In the current nineteenth Bundestag, the CDU/CSU chaired ten committees, the SPD five, the AfD and the FDP three each, The Left and the Greens two each. Members of the opposition party can chair a significant number of standing committees (e.g. the budget committee is by tradition chaired by the biggest opposition party). These committees have either a small staff or no staff at all.\nThe members of Bundestag and the presidium are supported by the Bundestag Administration. It is headed by the Director, that reports to the President of the Bundestag.\nThe Bundestag Administrations four departments are Parliament Service, Research, Information / Documentation and Central Affairs.\nThe Bundestag Administration employs around 3,000 employees.\nAs is the case with some other parliaments, the Bundestag is subject to the principle of discontinuation, meaning that a newly elected Bundestag is legally regarded to be a body and entity completely different from the previous Bundestag. This leads to the result that any motion, application or action submitted to the previous Bundestag, e.g. a bill referred to the Bundestag by the Federal Government, is regarded as void by non-decision (German terminology: \"Die Sache f\u00e4llt der Diskontinuit\u00e4t anheim\"). Thus any bill that has not been decided upon by the beginning of the new electoral period must be brought up by the government again if it aims to uphold the motion, this procedure in effect delaying the passage of the bill. Furthermore, any newly elected Bundestag will have to freshly decide on the rules of procedure (Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung), which is done by a formal decision of taking over such rules from the preceding Bundestag by reference.\nAny Bundestag (even after a snap election) is considered dissolved only once a newly elected Bundestag has actually gathered in order to constitute itself (Article 39 sec. 1 sentence 2 of the Basic Law), which has to happen within 30 days of its election (Article 39 sec. 2 of the Basic Law). Thus, it may happen (and has happened) that the old Bundestag gathers and makes decisions even after the election of a new Bundestag that has not gathered in order to constitute itself. For example, elections to the 16th Bundestag took place on 18 September 2005,[16] but the 15th Bundestag still convened after election day to make some decisions on German military engagement abroad,[17] and was entitled to do so, as the newly elected 16th Bundestag did not convene for the first time until 18 October 2005.[18]\n^The Rules of Procedure of the Bundestag (German: Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung) allocate one Vice-President to each political group (Fraktion). However, each candidate must still be elected by a parliamentary majority. Due to the candidates put forth by the AfD and their unanimous rejection by all other parties, no AfD candidate has reached such a majority.\n^Though the by-laws of the Bundestag do not mention such a position, the leader of the largest opposition Fraktion is called leader of the opposition by convention.\n^Article 38 Section 2 Grundgesetz: Any person who has attained the age of eighteen shall be entitled to vote; any person who has attained the age of majority may be elected.\n^ abThe Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union of Bavaria do not compete against each other in the same states and form one group within the Bundestag.\n^As reflected by the electoral threshold in Germany, parties are usually required to meet a threshold of at least 5% of nationwide votes or win at least 3 constituency seats; the SSW got a seat as a representative of a recognised minority group (in their case, Danes and Frisians), an exception enshrined into German electoral law.",

Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[2]\nOverall, in the calendar year 2022, the United States' Nominal GDP at Current Prices totaled at $25.463 trillion, as compared to $23.315 trillion in 2021.\nThe three U.S. states with the highest GDPs were California ($3.6 trillion), Texas ($2.356 trillion), and New York ($2.053 trillion).

        "context": "\nSo you want to read Victor Hugo\u2019s phenomenally successful novel about the Paris Uprising of 1832, perhaps because you are interested in French literature, or perhaps because you are a fan of the long-running musical. But you don\u2019t read French. Or you know a bit of French from high school, but not, like, nearly enough.\nNot a problem.\nEnglish translations have been available since 1862, the year the original was published. There are four English translations in the public domain and another four published in the last fifty years.\nKeep reading to learn how to choose an edition that\u2019s right for you.\nThere are eight English translations of Les Miserables, shown below in chronological order.\nBelow I have included excerpts of the same passage from all eight translations so that you can compare what the translators\u2019 language sounds like.\nThe Guinness Book of World Records gives the honor to Marcel Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time (aka Remembrance of Things Past), which is over a million words; Les Miserables is less than 600,000.\nStill, opinions are divided according to how length is measured and what is considered a novel. Long, monolithic Asian works, which may be as long or longer when translated into English, include The Plum in the Golden Vase; the Four Classic Chinese Novels: The Dream of the Red Chamber, Water Margin (aka Outlaws of the Marsh), Journey to the West, and The Romance of the Three Kingdoms; and The Tale of Genji.\nLee Fahnestock, in his introduction to the 1987 unabridged Signet Classics edition, naturally advises against it.\nWhile several abridged editions exist in English, that expedient seems a mistake. It is almost impossible to predict the individual detail, the flashing image or human quirk precisely observed, that will burn its way into a reader\u2019s mind for good. The sound solution is to honor the author\u2019s wishes (xii).\nPersonally, I agree, and I like how long books give the reader time and space to immerse himself or herself in not just the characters and plot but also the setting, style, and themes. But long books take time and focus that you might legitimately want to spend on something else.\nIf you\u2019re intimidated by long books and mainly interested in seeing what happens to the characters in this famous story, then you\u2019re better off with an abridged edition.\nThe Denny edition, as a kind of compromise, moves two of Hugo\u2019s longer digressions (Part 2, Book 7 and Part 4, Book 7) to the end of the book as appendices, leaving the overall numbering intact.\nAbridged editions leave out some chapters and also streamline the text within the chapters they retain.\nAll the abridged editions seem to be abridgements of the original Wilbour translation.\nThe musical differs in that it\u2019s extremely condensed compared to a 1,000-page book. Its duration is about 3 hours. An unabridged audiobook is 58 to 68 hours!\nAnd if you thought the story was about the French Revolution (1789\u20131799) and not the Paris Uprising of 1832, you\u2019re not alone. The musical is ambiguous, possibly even misleading. When Hugo\u2019s son adapted the novel for the stage, it didn\u2019t matter to him as much exactly what the specific conflict was, just that there was one, so some of the historical details were obscured or changed.\nIn \u201cThe Legacy of \u2018Les Miserables\u2019\u201d, Tobias Grey says the stage musical damages and deforms the original story by making the dishonest innkeepers into comic characters. Um. Okay. I guess you could look at it that way. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to watch a musical in which the dishonesty wasn\u2019t tempered by comedy. The book is pretty dark; I\u2019m okay with the musical being lighter.\n1862 \u00b7\nCharles E. Wilbour \u00b7\nLes Miserables\nHe was an American Egyptologist who left behind a large collection of books, letters, notebooks, and other records which are now housed in the Brooklyn Museum. He completed his translation of Les Miserables in New York before leaving the United States in 1874 to pursue his interest in Egyptian antiquities.\nThe Wilbour translation is the basis of the unabridged 1987 version available from Signet Classics, edited by Fahnestock and McAffee. In other words, in terms of quality, it has been superseded. I feel like the only reason you\u2019d read the Wilbour translation is if you reflexively bought the first cheap paperback to cross your path\u2026 which is what I did.\nIt is available free because it is no longer under copyright.\nIt was produced in six months and published in the same year as the original.\nIt was the basis for a pirated version published in 1863 in the Confederate States of America.\nIt uses an old style of English and tries to capture the flavor of the original by retaining French word order\u2014or actual French words and sentences.\nThe cover features an 1862 illustration of Cosette by Emile Bayard from the original French book. \"This Dover edition, first published in 2018, is an unabridged republication in one volume of the work originally published in 1887 by Thomas Y Crowell & Company, New York.\"\nThe cover features an 1862 illustration of Cosette by Emile Bayard from the original French book. \"This Dover edition, first published in 2018, is an unabridged republication in one volume of the work originally published in 1887 by Thomas Y Crowell & Company, New York.\"\nABRIDGED.

Abridged by Douglas Gordon Crawford. \"This abridged version of Victor Hugo's masterpiece was published in 1915 with the aim to provide 'a unified story of the life and soul-struggles of Jean Valjean'.\" From the introduction by Paul Bailey: \"This edition... dispenses with Hugo's reflections on the history of his beloved country, the architectural redesigning of Paris, the futility of the monarchical system, convents, sewers, religion and politics. What remains constitutes a deeply satisfying and rewarding novel. In this form, the characters and the events they are involved in take precedence.\"\nABRIDGED.

You can get it for free if you\u2019re interested, though.\nThe text was altered in places to fit the translator\u2019s political opinions. In \u201cThe Legacy of \u2018Les Miserables\u2019\u201d, Tobias Grey says Wraxall \u201cdid not hesitate to alter the meaning of Hugo\u2019s novel whenever he disagreed with passages pertaining to Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s downfall.\u201d\nContains scattered lines of dialogue and passages in untranslated French.\nIt handles wordplay and idioms badly. In \u201cSome Translations of Les Miserables\u201d, Olin H. Moore says Wraxall is \u201cgenerally much inferior to Wilbour, who in turn leaves much to be desired.\u201d\nThe translation is a pirated adaptation of the Wilbour translation produced in Richmond, Virginia by West and Johnston for a Southern audience. Publishers in the Confederacy chose to ignore Union copyright.\nChanges to the text were made for political reasons. The translator edited out passages that expressed disapproval of slavery.\nA special edition was produced specifically for Confederate soldiers, who subsequently began identifying with the downtrodden and calling themselves \u201cLee\u2019s Miserables\u201d.\nThe first volume does actually render the French better sometimes. Olin H. Moore calls it \u201cdistinctly superior to Wilbour\u2019s rendering\u201d.\nShe was an American writer and translator. She was strongly religious, and worked on uniting different Christian denominations. She translated works by Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Dostoevsky, among others. She translated not only Les Miserables by Victor Hugo, but also Notre Dame de Paris and Toilers of the Sea.\nBonded-leather cover with gilt decoration on cover and edges. Cover art and endpapers by Spencer Charles. Ribbon bookmark. From what I've seen online, the book doesn't state that this is the Hapgood translation, but (some of) the chapter titles match. I'm going to guess it's unabridged but with small font and tight line-spacing.\nI\u2019ll be honest, I get bad vibes from Denny\u2019s introduction. He seems to have approached the job of translating Les Miserables with the idea that not just the previous translators\u2019 work but also Hugo\u2019s work desperately needs to be improved upon. So in addition to moving two sections to the back, he abridges whatever he thinks is too long-winded because he\u2019s worried that otherwise you\u2019ll get bored and fail to sense Hugo\u2019s spirit.\nThis foreword is unavoidable if the reader is to know exactly what he is getting \u2013 not a photograph but a slightly modified version of Hugo\u2019s novel designed to bring its great qualities into clearer relief by thinning out, but never completely eliminating, its lapses.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of buying Denny\u2019s translation, read his introduction first and make sure you\u2019re happy with his approach.\nIncludes an introduction by the translator, scattered footnotes, and two chapters converted into appendixes. Cover design by Coralie Bickford-Smith.\nLee Fahnestock is a translator and critic. She has been honored by the French government for her services to French culture. Norman MacAfee is a writer and artist. Fahnestock and MacAfee also worked together to translate the letters of Jean-Paul Sartre.\nI feel like this edition is a good compromise between \u201ctime-tested\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d.\nIt has sold well over a million copies.\nIt is the official musical tie-in edition; thus the familiar, unchanging Cosette/Flag logo on the cover.\nIt is the reason fans call Les Miserables \u201cThe Brick\u201d (that\u2019s the size and shape of the paperback edition).\nIt is a complete translation, with the authors digressions left in place. (The 1976 translation had moved and removed some text.)\nIt is based on the Wilbour translation and retains an archaic flavor.\nIt is considered faithful to the French original but more accessible in that it updates the language in places and removes untranslated French words and passages that would frustrate those with no knowledge of the language.\nIncludes an Introduction by Lee Fahnestock and an Afterword by Chris Bohjalian. It does not contain any notes.\nShe is a translator of French. She has translated works by Racine, Moliere, Emile Zola, and Alexandre Dumas as well as Victor Hugo. She has also taught French language and literature and served as an interpreter in Paris. In 2016 she was made a Chevalier dans l\u2019Ordre des arts et des lettres by the French government. She loves to read crime fiction.\nIt is \u201cThe world\u2019s first fully original, unexpurgated English translation of Les Miserables\u201d because (presumably) the 19th-century translations edited out some things from delicacy, and Denny\u2019s version in 1976 was edited down, and Fahnestock and MacAfee started their complete and unabridged translation using Wilbour\u2019s. So even though it\u2019s the seventh version, it\u2019s also the first.\nThe text has been aggressively modernized, which is not to my taste. It has been characterized as slangy, wild, and not closely following the original. However, unlike the Fahnestock and MacAfee edition, it contains a lot of additional background information.\nIncludes an introduction by Robert Tombs, a chronology, a list for further reading, a note on the translation, and endnotes. Penguin Classics Deluxe editions have a \u201cdeckle\u201d edge (rough paper at the side) and the paper cover has two extra flaps that folds in at the front and at the back kind of like a dust jacket would.\n\u201cMario Vargas Llosa, helps us to appreciate the incredible ambition, power, and beauty of Hugo\u2019s masterpiece and, in the process, presents a humane vision of fiction as an alternative reality that can help us imagine a different and better world.\u201d \u2015Princeton University Press\nIn her 116-page Senior Thesis for Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, Turner concludes: \u201cThe story of Les Miserables, whether in the form of a novel, a play, or a musical, has helped Americans come to terms with violence and uprising during the most turbulent times in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\nThank you, this is helpful. Wow, it\u2019s complicated. It might be easier just to learn French. \ud83d\ude09\nI wish I had seen this before reading it. Now I\u2019m not sure which translation I read. I may have sold it in one of my (regrettable) purges when I was needing money. This was one of those books that I can say I enjoyed having read it\u2026 but the actual reading of it was a struggle at times. His \u201cdigressions\u201d are maddening. For the love of humanity, I don\u2019t need that much detailed description and history of this and that street! Get back to the plot before I forget what\u2019s going on!\nAs much as I hate abridgements and think they\u2019re an insult to the author, this is one case where I may be willing to try it as my second read-through. I really do love the story and characters. I wish I had the discipline to actually learn French so I could read the original. Alas, I am too lazy and too old for that to be a realistic goal.\nThanks for your feedback and for sharing about your experience! If you want to learn a bit of French, you could attempt a shorter classic. The Little Prince is a much more manageable length and still very rewarding. \ud83d\ude42\nI have been reading the Denny translation, and then listening to the Donougher translation (available on audiobook), while looking over the Denny translation again. Doing this side by side for 800 pages (so far), I have a couple of observations.\nHugo will go for 17 adjectives, Denny sometimes scales this back to seven or so, Donougher goes whole hog, 17 means 17. The Donougher translation of a sentence when overlaid over Denny\u2019s translation can seem like a blanket over of litter of puppies. You can see the underlying chaotic energy trying to wriggle from under the covers.\nDenny can clarify in his translation. Donougher will give you something like: \u201c[Name] and [Other Name] divided Paris between them. Denny will give you \u201c[Name], famous criminal and [Other Name], famous police detective divided Paris between them. I felt that Ms. Werts had some reservations about the Denny translation. I have fewer reservations, but I must concede that Donougher\u2019s translation is an improvement over Denny.\nI bought an 1862 \u2013 Charles E. Wilbour Everyman\u2019s Library hardcopy with ribbon version that I like very much and I\u2019ve found to be an easy read if you love classics like the English that\u2019s found in the greatest novels of all time like \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d or works by Austen or the Bronte Sisters. If you can read and enjoy those then I don\u2019t see why the WIlbour version should be that much more difficult or onerous to read and enjoy. I think too many \u201cmodern\u201d readers look for the easy way out and prefer \u201cmodern\u201d English because they don\u2019t want to put in the work I\u2019ve recently read Lydia Davis\u2019 \u201cSwann\u2019s Way\u201d but is it really superior to the latest Moncrieff-Kilmartin edition just because the former is a more \u201cmodern\u201d translation? I agree with Lucy Day that you should look and choose a translation that suits you instead of relying on other\u2019s opinions on the internet. I\u2019ve read \u201cKaramazov\u201d twice and in different translations and I intend to revisit this a third time in a different translation and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find differences but that doesn\u2019t make one version clearly superior to another unless off course there are clear deficiencies like in the source matter for example. Anyway I guess I\u2019m saying don\u2019t assume the latest translation of Les Miz is the best just because everyone says so because I\u2019m thoroughly enjoying my version and so far I can find little if anything to complain about.\nGreetings, just to ask, are you certain that the Macmillan Collector\u2019s Library edition utilizes Wilbour\u2019s translation; I ask for I compared both and found them to be greatly contrasting each other, unless Douglas Gordon Crawford edited far more than entitled, into the extent of re-writing. Could this editor have done such?\nThanks for your question! It is certain that the 1915 Macmillan version was \u201cabridged and edited\u201d by Douglas Gordon Crawford based on one of the earlier translations (he did not do a new translation from French himself). When I compared a bit of text from the beginning of the novel, I decided that the Wilbour translation is the translation that the Macmillan version most resembles. But as you observed, Crawford\u2019s text is quite different. So the \u201cediting\u201d he did was not just cutting the chapters that people sometimes say are not related to the plot. Crawford clearly did some rewriting in the chapters he kept. I think that\u2019s fairly common, and it\u2019s a big reason people don\u2019t like abridged versions.\nBottom line: No full-text, multi-volume hardcover editions at any price, more\u2019s the pity. If you want it in two volumes, the only choice seems to be Wilbour, Wordsworth ed. At least you could read it lying back in bed without fear of a nosebleed if you drop it.",

        "context": "\nShoshana Zuboff (born November 18, 1951)[2] is an American author, professor, social psychologist, philosopher, and scholar.\nZuboff is the author of the books In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power and The Support Economy: Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism, co-authored with James Maxmin. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, integrates core themes of her research: the Digital Revolution, the evolution of capitalism, the historical emergence of psychological individuality, and the conditions for human development.[2]\nZuboff's work is the source of many original concepts including \"surveillance capitalism\", \"instrumentarian power\", \"the division of learning in society\", \"economies of action\", \"the means of behavior modification\", \"information civilization\", \"computer-mediated work\", the \"automate/informate\" dialectic, \"abstraction of work\", \"individualization of consumption\" and \"the coup from above\".\nZuboff's 1988 book, In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power, is a study of information technology in the workplace.[4][5][6][7]\nMajor concepts introduced in this book relate to knowledge, authority, and power in the information workplace. These include the duality of information technology as an informating and an automating technology; the abstraction of work associated with information technology and its related intellectual skill demands; computer-mediated work; the \"information panopticon\"; information technology as a challenge to managerial authority and command/control; the social construction of technology; the shift from a division of labor to a division of learning; and the inherently collaborative patterns of information work, among others.\nThe Support Economy: Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism (2002), co-authored with James Maxmin, is the product of multi-disciplinary research integrating history, sociology, management, and economics. It argues that the new structure of demand associated with the \"individuation of consumption\" had produced widespread institutional failures in every domain, including a growing divide between the individuals and the commercial organizations upon which they depend.\nWriting before the advent of smartphones and widespread Internet access, Zuboff and Maxmin argue that wealth creation in an individualized society would require leveraging new digital capabilities to enable a \"distributed capitalism\". This would entail a shift away from a primary focus on economies of scale, asset intensification, concentration, central control, and anonymous transactions in \"organization-space\" towards support-oriented relationships in \"individual-space\" with products and services configured and distributed to meet individualized wants and needs.[8]\nZuboff's work explores a novel market form and a specific logic of capitalist accumulation that she termed \"surveillance capitalism\". She first presented her concept in a 2014 essay, \"A Digital Declaration\", published in German and English in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.[9] Her followup 2015 scholarly article in the Journal of Information Technology titled \"Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization\"[10] received the International Conference on Information Systems Scholars' 2016 Best Paper Award.[11]\nSurveillance capitalism and its consequences for twenty-first century society are most fully theorized in her book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. She summarizes it thus: \"Surveillance capitalism is best described as a coup from above, not an overthrow of the state but rather an overthrow of the people's sovereignty and a prominent force in the perilous drift towards democratic de-consolidation that now threatens Western liberal democracies.\"[12]\nThe \"epistemic coup\" (i.e. the coup enacted by tech corporations to claim ownership of knowledge in society) is summarized as follows:\n\"In an information civilization, societies are defined by questions of knowledge\u2014how it is distributed, the authority that governs its distribution and the power that protects that authority.\nWho knows? Who decides who knows? Who decides who decides who knows?\nSurveillance capitalists now hold the answers to each question, though we never elected them to govern.\nThis is the essence of the epistemic coup. They claim the authority to decide who knows by asserting ownership rights over our personal information and defend that authority with the power to control critical information systems and infrastructures.\"[13]\nZuboff's scholarship on surveillance capitalism as a \"rogue mutation of capitalism\" has become a primary framework for understanding big data and the larger field of commercial surveillance that she describes as a \"surveillance-based economic order\". She argues that neither privacy nor antitrust laws provide adequate protection from the unprecedented practices of surveillance capitalism. Zuboff describes surveillance capitalism as an economic and social logic. Her book originated the concept of \"instrumentarian power\", in comparison to traditional totalitarian power. Instrumentarian power is a consequence of surveillance capitalist operations which threaten individual autonomy and democracy. As the driving force behind it, she identifies capital accumulation, without being confined to market capitalism.[12]\nMany issues that plague contemporary society including the assault on privacy and the so-called \"privacy paradox\", behavioral targeting, fake news, ubiquitous tracking, legislative and regulatory failure, algorithmic governance, social media addiction, abrogation of human rights, democratic destabilization, and more are reinterpreted and explained through the lens of surveillance capitalism's economic and social imperatives. Her work is an influential source for the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence community.\nIn 1993, Zuboff founded the executive education program \"Odyssey: School for the Second Half of Life\" at the Harvard Business School. The program addressed the issues of transformation and career renewal at midlife. During twelve years of her teaching and leadership, Odyssey became known as the premier program of its kind in the world.[14][15]\nIn addition to her academic work, Zuboff brought her ideas to many commercial and public/private ventures through her public speaking as well as her direct involvement in key projects, particularly in social housing, health care, education, and elder care.\nZuboff also became a business columnist, developing and disseminating new concepts from The Support Economy. From 2003 to 2005, Zuboff published her ideas in her monthly column \"Evolving\", published in the magazine Fast Company.[16] From 2007 through 2009, she was a featured columnist for Business Week.[17]",

        "context": "\nNorth America will soon be treated to two major solar eclipses, when the Sun, Moon, and Earth align. On October 14, 2023, anyone under clear skies within a path that sweeps from Oregon to Texas and then through parts of Central and South America will see an annular (\"ring\") eclipse. Just six months later, on April 8, 2024, a total solar eclipse will sweep from Mexico to Texas to eastern Canada, plunging day into night and revealing the magnificent solar corona for anyone fortunate to be within the path of totality and under clear skies. Nearly everyone in North America will have a partial solar eclipse both days, weather permitting. Map courtesy Michael Zeiler, GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\nDo you remember the total solar eclipse that crossed the continental United States from coast to coast on August 21, 2017? If you lived in, or traveled into, the 70-mile-wide path of totality, where the Moon completely blocked the Sun's bright face and turned day into night for a few minutes, you undoubtedly remember it well. If you were outside that path under clear skies somewhere else in North America (or northern South America), perhaps you saw a partial solar eclipse that day.\nThe 2017 total solar eclipse was the first to touch the \"Lower 48\" since 1979 and the first to span the U.S. from coast to coast since 1918. Remarkably, another total solar eclipse is coming to North America on April 8, 2024, just seven years after the last one. This time the Moon's dark central shadow, about 115 miles wide, will cross Mexico, sweep northeast from Texas to Maine, and then darken eastern Canada. A partial solar eclipse will again be visible to nearly everyone in North America fortunate to have cloud-free skies.\nEven more remarkably, we'll have a different type of solar eclipse in North America just six months earlier. On October 14, 2023, the Moon will again pass directly between Earth and the Sun \u2014 but this time it will not quite completely cover the solar disk, instead turning it into a thin \"ring of fire.\" This annular (Latin for ring-shaped) eclipse will be visible within a roughly 125-mile-wide path from Oregon to Texas and on into Mexico and northern South America. And again, North Americans outside the path will be treated to a partial solar eclipse if the weather cooperates.\nDuring a partial solar eclipse (left), the Moon covers only part of the Sun's bright face. During an annular eclipse (middle), the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun but appears too small to fully cover it, leaving a \"ring of fire\" still shining. These first two photos were taken through a safe solar filter passing less than 1/100,000th of the light, which is why the sky appears black. During the total phase of a total solar eclipse, or totality (right), the Moon completely blocks the Sun's bright face, turning day into deep twilight and revealing the magnificent solar corona \u2014 our star's wispy outer atmosphere \u2014 in one of the most awesome sights in all of nature. This last photo was taken without a solar filter, since the totally eclipsed Sun is only about as bright as the full Moon and just as safe to look at directly. Images courtesy Rick Fienberg, Sky & Telescope, and TravelQuest International.\nThe only time it is safe to view the Sun without special-purpose eye protection is during the total phase of a total eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun's bright face, the sky darkens to deep twilight blue, and the Sun's corona \u2014 its faint, wispy outer atmosphere \u2014 emerges into view. On April 8, 2024, totality will last at most 4\u00bd minutes and will be visible only within the narrow path swept out by the Moon's dark shadow. Even within that path, though, the Sun will be partially eclipsed for more than an hour before totality and again afterward. During these partial phases, you must not look at the Sun without proper protection!\nFor the eclipse on October 14, 2023, at least part of the Sun's bright face will remain visible throughout the event, so it is essential at all times to view the Sun through a safe solar filter, that is, one that meets the transmission requirements of the ISO 12312-2 international standard. Such filters are widely available and cost at most a few dollars. Looking at the uneclipsed or partially (or annularly) eclipsed Sun through dark sunglasses or any other unapproved filter is a recipe for serious and potentially permanent eye injury. See our Eye Safety and Resources pages for details.\nThe following pages contain basic information about the coming North American solar eclipses and about solar eclipses more generally, along with links to more comprehensive information on other trusted websites.",

        "context": "\nIn Japanese, due to the special nature of the work of the head of government, the prime minister's titles vary depending on context, sometimes demonstrating his/her role. Since the inception of the cabinet system, the prime minister is known in Japanese as Naikaku S\u014dri-Daijin (\u5185\u95a3\u7dcf\u7406\u5927\u81e3) whenever he is referred to as the head of the Cabinet. However, this title is usually abbreviated to S\u014dri-Daijin (\u7dcf\u7406\u5927\u81e3). Other abbreviations include S\u014dri (\u7dcf\u7406), Shush\u014d (\u9996\u76f8) or even Saish\u014d (\u5bb0\u76f8).[4]\nThe official English rendering is 'Prime Minister'.[5] This English translation was informally used as the English translation of 'Grand Minister' before the introduction of the cabinet system. However, this was not the original English translation of 'Prime Minister', and a German translation, 'Minister President of the State', was also used in the past.\nUnder this system, the Daij\u014d-daijin (\u592a\u653f\u5927\u81e3, Chancellor of the Realm)[6] was the head of the Daij\u014d-kan (Department of State), the highest organ of Japan's pre-modern Imperial government during the Heian period and until briefly under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanj\u014d Sanetomi in 1871. The office was replaced in 1885 with the appointment of It\u014d Hirobumi to the new position of Minister President of State,[7] four years before the enactment of the Meiji Constitution, which mentions neither the Cabinet nor the position of Prime Minister explicitly.[8][9] It took its current form with the adoption of the Constitution of Japan in 1947.\nThe prime minister is nominated by both houses of the Diet, before the conduct of any other business. For that purpose, each conducts a ballot under the run-off system. If the two houses choose different individuals, then a joint committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common nominee. Ultimately, however, if the two houses do not agree within ten days, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. Therefore, the House of Representatives can theoretically ensure the appointment of any prime minister it wants.[11] The nominee is then presented with his or her commission, and formally appointed to office by the emperor.[12]\nConventionally, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. But there have been three cabinet prime ministers from junior coalition partners (Ashida 1948, Hosokawa 1993, Murayama 1994), a few minority governments (most recently the Hata Cabinet in 1994 and at least numerically the Second Hashimoto Cabinet of 1996 during its first year, but with an extra-cabinet cooperation (\u95a3\u5916\u5354\u529b, kakugai ky\u014dryoku) agreement with two parties, sufficient to ensure safe majorities for most government initiatives), and several cabinets with a majority in the House of Representatives, but without legislative majority of their own (most recently the DPJ-led cabinets after the 2010 election; cf. Nejire Kokkai/\"twisted Diets\").[citation needed]\nMay override a court injunction against an administrative act upon showing of cause.[23]\nUnlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the prime minister is both de jure and de facto chief executive. In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the prime minister is the leader. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of cabinet collective responsibility, the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the prime minister's authority.\nLocated near the Diet building, the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan is called the Kantei (\u5b98\u90b8). The original Kantei served from 1929 until 2002, when a new building was inaugurated to serve as the current Kantei.[24] The old Kantei was then converted into the Official Residence, or K\u014dtei (\u516c\u90b8).[25] The K\u014dtei lies to the southwest of the Kantei, and is linked by a walkway.[25]\nFor overseas air travel, the Japanese government maintains two Boeing 777, which replaced the Boeing 747-400 also in 2019. The aircraft is also used by the emperor, the members of the imperial family, and other high-ranking officials.\nThey have the radio callsigns Japanese Air Force One and Japanese Air Force Two when operating on official business, and Cygnus One and Cygnus Two when operating outside of official business (e.g., on training flights). The aircraft always fly together on government missions, with one serving as the primary transport and the other serving as a backup with maintenance personnel on board. The aircraft are officially referred to as Japanese government exclusive aircraft (\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5c02\u7528\u6a5f, Nippon-koku seifu sen'y\u014dki).[26]\nUntil the mid-1930s, the prime minister of Japan was normally granted a hereditary peerage (kazoku) prior to leaving office if he had not already been ennobled. Titles were usually bestowed in the ranks of count, viscount or baron, depending on the relative accomplishments and status of the prime minister. The two highest ranks, marquess and prince, were only bestowed upon highly distinguished statesmen, and were not granted to a prime minister after 1928. The last prime minister who was a peer was Baron Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara, who served as Prime Minister from October 1945 to May 1946. The peerage was abolished when the Constitution of Japan came into effect in May 1947.\nCertain eminent prime ministers have been awarded the Order of the Chrysanthemum, typically in the degree of Grand Cordon. The highest honour in the Japanese honours system, the Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, has only been conferred upon select prime ministers and eminent statesmen; the last such award to a living prime minister was to Saionji Kinmochi in 1928. More often, the Order of the Chrysanthemum has been a posthumous distinction; both the Collar and Grand Cordon of the order were last awarded posthumously to former prime minister Shinzo Abe in July 2022.[27]\nAfter relinquishing office, the prime minister is normally accorded the second or senior third rank in the court order of precedence, and is usually raised to the senior second rank posthumously. Certain distinguished prime ministers have been posthumously raised to the first rank; the last such award was to Eisaku Sato in 1975. Since the 1920s, following their tenure in office, Prime ministers have typically been conferred with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers (until 2003 a special higher class of the Order of the Rising Sun), depending on tenure and eminence. However, honours may be withheld due to misconduct or refusal on the part of the prime minister (for example, Kiichi Miyazawa).\nThe Prime Minister also awards individuals in recognition of their accomplishments in sport, entertainment, and other fields. Some of the awards and commendations offered include the Prime Minister's Award, created by Eisaku Sat\u014d in 1966, and the People's Honour Award, created by Takeo Fukuda in 1977. Additionally, the PM also presents the Prime Minister's Trophy on behalf of the Japan Professional Sports Association and the Monodzukuri Nippon award on behalf of the Japanese Manufacturing Association.\n^The Cabinet shall resign en masse after a general election of members of the House of Representatives. Their term of office is four years which can be terminated earlier. No limits are imposed on the number of terms or tenures the Prime Minister may hold. The Prime Minister is, by convention, the leader of the victorious party, though some prime ministers have been elected from junior coalition partners or minority parties.\n^Article 55 of the Imperial Constitution only bound the ministers of state, i.e. all members of the cabinet including the prime minister, to \"give their advice to the Emperor and be responsible for it.\"",

        "context": "\nThis is a list of the oldest existing universities in continuous operation in the world.\nInclusion in this list is determined by the date at which the educational institute first met the traditional definition of a university used by academic historians[Note 1][specify] although it may have existed as a different kind of institution before that time.[4] This definition limits the term university to institutions with distinctive structural and legal features that developed in Europe, and which make the university form different from other institutions of higher learning in the pre-modern world, even though these may sometimes now be referred to popularly as universities. To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. So some early universities, including the University of Paris, founded around the beginning of the 13th century[5] but abolished by the French Revolution in 1793,[6] are excluded. Some institutions reemerge, but with new foundations, such as the modern University of Paris, which came into existence in 1896 after the Louis Liard law disbanded Napoleon's University of France system.\nThe word university is derived from the Latinuniversitas magistrorum et scholarium, which approximately means 'community of teachers and scholars'. The University of Bologna in Bologna, Italy, where teaching began around 1088 and which was organised into a university in the late twelfth century, is the world's oldest university in continuous operation,[1] and the first university in the sense of a higher-learning and degree-awarding institute.[7][8][1] The origin of many medieval universities can be traced back to the Catholiccathedral schools or monastic schools, which appeared as early as the sixth century and were run for hundreds of years as such before their formal establishment as universities in the high medieval period.[9]\nThe university as an institution was historically rooted in medieval society, which it in turn influenced and shaped. Academic historian Walter R\u00fcegg asserts that:[12]\nThe university is a European institution; indeed, it is the European institution par excellence. There are various reasons for this assertion. As a community of teachers and taught, accorded certain rights, such as administrative autonomy and the determination and realisation of curricula (courses of study) and of the objectives of research as well as the award of publicly recognised degrees, it is a creation of medieval Europe, which was the Europe of papal Christianity [...].\nThis list includes medieval universities that were founded before 1500 and which have retained institutional continuity since then (excluding not only those that ceased to exist, but also those that merged into or split away to an institution which is regarded as newly established). Several of these have been closed for brief periods: for example the University of Siena was closed 1805\u20131815 during the Napoleonic wars, and universities in the Czech Republic and Poland were closed during Nazi occupation, 1938\u20131945.\nUniversities are dated from when, according to scholars, they first met the definition of a university. In cases such as the universities of Bologna and Oxford which trace their history back to teaching in individual schools prior to their formation into a university, or which existed in another form prior to being a university, the date in the list below is thus later than the date given by the institutions for their foundation.[14]\nLaw schools existed in Bologna from the second half of the 12th century, with 1088 often considered to be the date on which teaching outside of ecclesiastical schools began.[16] In 1158, petitions by Bolognese doctors of law led to Emperor Barbarossa granting the \"Authentic Habita\", which granted various rights to students and masters but did not name Bologna or any other particular place of study.[17] However, it is unlikely that the university had become organised by the 1150s, and this may have been as late as the 1180s.[18] The law schools appear to have remained independent, private entities until around 1180, but became organised over the following decade. In 1189 the masters made an agreement with the commune not to transfer the studium to another town, while the Lombard students were organised into a 'nation' by 1191.[16][19]\nTeaching existed in Oxford from the late 11th century,[21] with the university giving the date of 1096 for the earliest classes.[22] However, it was not until the early 13th century that the schools in Oxford took on an organised character. In 1201 a papal letter described John Grimm as magister scolarum Oxonie.[23] In 1209 the masters suspended their teaching in Oxford and moved to other towns (including Cambridge, leading to the foundation of the university there),[24] returning after a bull issued on 20 June 1214 by the papal legate, Niccol\u00f2 de Romanis, that granted a number of rights to the university and established the office of chancellor.[25] Both Oxford and Cambridge were granted rights of discipline over students and of fixing rents in letters issued by King Henry III in 1231.[26] A royal charter, sometimes referred to as the Magna Carta of the university, was granted in 1244, awarding further rights to the university.[27] The university received a papal bull Querentes in agro in 1254, with a first version issued on 27 September and a second version on 6 October. The first version followed the common form of privileges granted to monastic houses, confirming the liberties and immunities granted to the university and placing the members of the university under papal protection, but the second version (which was the version recorded in the papal register) explicitly recognised and approved the existence of the university as a scholarly community and confirmed its \"liberties, ancient customs and approved statutes\".[28]\nFounded by scholars leaving Oxford after a dispute caused by the execution of three scholars in 1209.[24] The university was organised under a chancellor by 1225.[29] The university takes 1209 as its official anniversary.[30] Along with Oxford, Cambridge was granted rights of discipline over its students and of fixing rents in letters issued by King Henry III in 1231.[26] It received papal recognition as an academic corporation via an indult granted by Pope Gregory IX in 1233 and was named as a studium generale in the papal bullInter singula in 1318. The traditional view was that this raised it to a studium generale but more recent scholarship (which is now generally, although not universally, accepted) sees the bull as confirming, rather than conferring, this status.[31][32]\nIt is the world's oldest state-funded university in continuous operation,[2][3] as one of the first to be founded by a head of state, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Sicily. Refounded in 1234, 1239 and 1465, and closed 1490\u20131507.[36]\nFaculties of theology, law and medicine closed during the Bohemian Reformation, leaving only the faculty of liberal arts. Became Charles-Ferdinand University after the Thirty Years' War, with all four faculties restored. Split into German and Czech parts in 1882; the Czech branch restored the name Charles University after independence in 1918 and closed briefly during Nazi occupation (1939\u20131945) while the German branch closed permanently in 1945.[41]\nClaims to have been founded in 1240 by the Commune of Siena,[42] although Rashdall dates the proclamation of the Studium to 1246, when Frederick II tried to place a ban on scholars travelling to Bologna, the date also given by Verger.[5] Was granted some exemptions from taxes by Pope Innocent II in 1252, but closed shortly after when the scholars returned to Bologna. Attempted revivals in 1275 and (fed by further short-lived migrations of scholars from Bologna) in 1321 and 1338 were unsuccessful. Gained an Imperial Bull in 1357 \"granting it de novo the 'privileges of a Studium Generale.'\", but was not firmly established until \"[i]n 1408 a fresh grant of privileges was obtained from Pope Gregory XII\".[43] Closed temporarily in 1808\u20131815 when Napoleonic forces occupied Tuscany.[42]\nFounded by King Casimir the Great as a studium generale in 1364. After the death of Casimir the Great in 1370, the development of the university stalled, with lectures being held in various places across the city, including churches and the Wawel cathedral school, and eventually coming to a pause. The faculty of theology was re-opened in 1397 by Queen Jadwiga who left a large endowment to the university upon her death in 1399. The university was formally re-established on 26 July 1400 by King W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o. After Krak\u00f3w was incorporated into the Austrian Empire, the university was merged with Lw\u00f3w University from 1805 to 1809. The university was forcibly shut down during the German Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945). The staff was deported to German-Nazi concentration camps, and many of its collections were deliberately destroyed by the occupying German authorities. Underground lectures continued for around 800 students during this period and the university formally reopened in 1945.[44]\nEstablished 1343 but closed around 1360; refounded at the start of the 15th century.[5] Formally founded on 3 September 1343 by a bull of Pope Clement VI, although according to the university \"a number of scholars claim its origin dates back to the 11th century\". Transferred to Pistoia, Prato and Florence between 1494 and 1543.[45]\nContinuous operation during the Reformation is disputed. Some sources state that \"the Catholic university of Rostock closed altogether and the closure was long enough to make the refounded body feel a new institution\"[54] and that \"[the university] fell into complete decay after the beginning of the Reformation in (1523) when the university revenues were lost and matriculations ceased\".[55] However, Johann Oldendorp is reported by several sources as having held a professorship at the university from 1526 to 1534, although this is not proven beyond doubt,[56] and other historians refer to \"the remaining university lecturers\" as supporting plans to restore the university revenues in 1532 (which was eventually accomplished via the Rostock Formula concordiae in 1563).[57] There are records of a number of professors being appointed in 1551, including Johannes Aurifaber, David Chytraeus, and Johann Draconites [de].[58][59]\nFounded by Alfonso V of Aragon on 3 September 1450 as the Estudi General de Barcelona. From 1401 the city had a medical school founded by King Martin of Aragon (the Estudi General de Medecina de Barcelona), to which a faculty of arts was added in 1402. Before this, there were chairs of higher education (associated with the cathedral, the Dominican Convent of Santa Carolina, and the escoles majors supported by the city's governing council) from the 13th century.[60]\nFounded by papal bull in 1451, it is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's four ancient universities. Along with the universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and St Andrews, the university was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century.\nSome professors from Rostock taught temporarily in Greifswald between 1437 and 1443 due to unrest in Rostock. The university was founded in 1456 by Duke Wartislaw IX with the approval of Pope Callixtus III on the initiative of Heinrich Rubenow, Lord Mayor of Greifswald (and first rector). Teaching paused temporarily during the Protestant Reformation (1527\u201339).[61]\nEstablished in 1477 by the Catholic Archbishop Jakob Ulvsson. Decayed due to political unrest in the first decade of the 16th century and then the Reformation in the 1520s and 30s, remaining \"only an idea without real content\" until re-chartered in 1595.[64]\nThe majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\nFounded as Estudos Gerais Universit\u00e1rios de Angola. Was renamed Universidade de Luanda (University of Luanda) in 1968. After Angolan independence from Portugal in 1975, the institution was renamed the University of Angola (Universidade de Angola). In 1985 it was renamed Agostinho Neto University, in honour of Agostinho Neto, the first President of Angola.\nThe university was originally called the University College of Addis Ababa in 1950, offering courses leading to degrees of the University of London. It became Haile Selassie I University in 1962, named after the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I. The institution received its current name in 1975.\nFounded as the University College of the Gold Coast, an affiliate college of the University of London which supervised its academic programmes and awarded the degrees. It gained full university status in 1961.\nOldest in Kenya. Established 1956 as the Royal Technical College. Renamed the Royal College of Nairobi when it became affiliated to the University of London in 1961. On 20 May 1964, was renamed University College Nairobi when it was admitted as a constituent college of inter-territorial University of East Africa. In 1970, it transformed into the first national university in Kenya and was renamed the University of Nairobi.[71]\nFounded in 1939, and was originally named Egerton Farm School. It was established by a land grant of 740 acres (3 km2) by Maurice Egerton, 4th Baron Egerton. The school's original purpose was to prepare white European youth for careers in agriculture. By 1955, the name had changed to Egerton Agricultural College. A one-year certificate course and a two-year diploma course in agriculture were offered. In 1958, Lord Egerton donated another 1,100 acres (4.5 km2) of land. Soon afterward, the college opened its doors to people of all races from Kenya and other African countries in 1956. In 1979, with support from the Government of Kenya and USAID, the college expanded yet again, becoming part of the University of Nairobi system. In 1987, the college was recognized as a chartered public university.[72]\nA royal decree was issued on 15 December 1955 for the founding of the university. The first faculty to be formed was the Faculty of Literature in Benghazi, and the royal palace \"Al Manar\", from which King Idris I of Libya declared its independence on 24 December 1951, was assigned to be the campus. Later divided to University of Benghazi and University of Tripoli, the names were changed again during Gaddafi's era, but now they have reinstated their original names.\nThe Faculty of Agriculture is the oldest faculty of the university. It was founded in 1914 as the School of Agriculture in 1914, and in 1966 it was incorporated into the newly established University of Mauritius.\nTraces its origins back to the al-Qarawiyyin mosque and associated madrasa founded by Fatima al-Fihri in 859, and was named a university in 1965. It is the oldest continuously operating institution of higher learning in the world,[73][74] though only became an official university in 1965.\nOldest university-level institution in Africa. Founded as a missionary school to train teachers in 1827. Became an affiliated college of Durham University in 1876 and awarded first degrees in West Africa in 1878. Became part of the federal University of Sierra Leone in 1967.[78][79]\nKnown in Chinese as \u6e56\u5357\u5927\u5b66. The university was originally called the Yuelu Academy in 976 and was converted into Hunan Institute of Higher Learning (with university status) in 1903. It was later renamed Hunan Normal College, Hunan Public Polytechnic School, and finally Hunan University in 1926.[83]\nThe first higher education institution in China. It was established in 1895 as Imperial Tientsin University (\u5929\u6d25\u5317\u6d0b\u897f\u5b78\u5b78\u5802) and later Peiyang University (\u5317\u6d0b\u5927\u5b78). In 1951, after restructuring, it was renamed Tianjin University, and became one of the largest multidisciplinary engineering universities in China.\nTraces its origins to a Confucian institution Taihsueh (\u592a\u5b78), which was founded in 258. Known in Chinese as Jinling University (\u91d1\u9675\u5927\u5b66). Was a private university later merged with the public University of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac\u5927\u5b66). First institution in China to use the English term \"university\". Educational institutions were closed in China on 13 June 1966 due to the Cultural Revolution, reopening in July 1967.[84]\nNamed after Khwarizmi (c. 780\u2013850), Persian mathematician, astronomer and geographer. It was established in 1919 as the Central Teachers' Institute and gained university status as Tarbiat Moallem University of Tehran in 1974. It changed its name to Kharazmi University on January 31, 2012.[87]\nPrevious names are University of Tokyo (1877\u20131886), Imperial University (1886\u20131897), and Tokyo Imperial University (1897\u20131947). Its origins include a private college of Confucian studies founded by Hayashi Razan in 1630,[88] Tenmonkata (The Observatory, 1684)[89] and Shut\u014dsho (Smallpox Vaccination Centre, 1849).[90] The university was established in 1877 by the merger of three institutions: Shoheiko (Japanese and Chinese Literature, established 1789), Yogakusho (Occidental Studies, established 1855) and Shutosho (Vaccinations, established 1860), originally as Tokyo University before becoming the Imperial University and then Tokyo Imperial University before reverting to its original name after World War II.[91]\nFounded as a \"school for Dutch studies\" in 1858. College with three university departments (literature, law and economics) established 1890. Accredited as a university by the Japanese government in 1920.[92]\nSungkyunkwan was established in 1398 as the highest educational institution of the Joseon Dynasty. In 1895, Sungkyunkwan was reformed into a modern three-year university after the national state examination was abolished the previous year. It was again reorganized as Sungkyunkwan University in 1946 at the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea.\nWhile Europe had 143 universities in 1789, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars took a heavy toll, reducing the number to 83 by 1815. The universities of France were abolished[6] and over half of the universities in both Germany and Spain were destroyed. By the mid 19th century, Europe had recovered to 98 universities.[104]\nOriginally established in 1957 as the State University of Tirana through merging of five existing institutes of higher education, the most important of which was the Institute of Sciences, founded in 1947.\nIn 1930, the government ordered the university shut down in accordance with a reorganization of higher education, and the university was replaced with the Supreme Pedagogical Institute. In 1934 the university was reestablished.\nFounded in 1834 as the Universit\u00e9 libre de Belgique (Free University of Belgium). In 1836, it changed its name to Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles. On 1 October 1969, the university was split into two sister institutions: the French-speaking Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Both names mean Free University of Brussels in English, so neither uses the English translation as it is ambiguous.\nHistory of the university began on 23 September 1669, when the Holy Roman EmperorLeopold I issued a decree granting the establishment of the Jesuit Academy of the Royal Free City of Zagreb. Decree was accepted at the Council of the Croatian Kingdom on 3 November 1671.\nFounded by papal bull in 1229 as the University of Toulouse. It closed in 1793 due to the French Revolution, and reopened in 1896. In 1969, it split into three separate universities and numerous specialised institutions of higher education. It no longer represents a single university, as it is now the collective entity which federates the universities and specialised institutions of higher education in the region.\nFounded in 1409 as the University of Provence, and in 1792, dissolved, along with twenty-one other universities. In 1896 it was reformed as the University of Aix-Marseille, one of 17 self-governing regional universities financed by the state. In 1968 it was divided into two institutions, the University of Provence (Aix-Marseille I) as a school of languages and letters, and the University of Aix-Marseille (Aix-Marseille II) as primarily a school of medicine and sciences. In 1973 the University of Law, Economics and Science (Aix-Marseille III) was added. In 2012 the three universities merged and was renamed Aix-Marseille University.\nFounded by Philip II of Spain in 1559 as the University of Douai. It closed in 1795 due to the French Revolution, and reopened in 1808. In 1887, it was transferred as University of Lille 27 km away from Douai. In 1971, it split into three separate universities. At the beginning of 2018, the three universities merged to form again the University of Lille.\nEstablished in 1506 as the Alma Mater Viadrina. Relocated and merged with the Leopoldina in Breslau (present-day Wroc\u0142aw, Poland) in 1811. Reestablished in Frankfurt (Oder) in 1991 after German reunification.\nFounded in 1635 by the archbishop and theologian P\u00e9ter P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny as the University of Nagyszombat. Renamed Royal Hungarian University of Science in 1769. The university was moved to Buda (today part of Budapest) in 1777. The university moved to its final location in Pest (now also part of Budapest) in 1784 and was renamed Royal University of Pest. It has been renamed three times since then: University of Budapest (1873\u20131921), (Hungarian Royal P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter University (1921\u20131950), and since 1950, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University.\nThe Utrecht University was abolished during the Napoleonic era, reorganized as a French Imperial School for Higher Education. Only after the defeat of Napoleon and the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815 was it to be reconstituted as a university.\nFounded in 1702 by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor as the university Leopoldina. It has been renamed five times since then: Universitas Literarum Vratislaviensis in 1742 by King Frederick II of Prussia, Silesian Friedrich Wilhelm University in Breslau in 1811, University of Breslau in the second half of the 19th century, Boles\u0142aw Bierut university between 1952 and 1989, and since 1989, University of Wroc\u0142aw.\nClaims to be the successor of the university established along with the Academic Gymnasium and the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences on 24 January 1724 by a decree of Peter the Great. In the period between 1804 and 1819, Saint Petersburg University officially did not exist\nFounded in 1808 as the Belgrade Higher School, by 1838 it merged with the Kragujevac-based departments into a single university, under current name from 1905; Orthodox Christian Lyceum in 1794; Teacher's college in 1778.\nA Franciscan Studium Generale was founded in Lund in 1425, as the first university in Northern Europe, but as a result of the Protestant Reformation the operations of the catholic university were suspended.\nIts ultimate origins lie in a madrasa and institute of higher education founded by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1453; was reformed to a Western style of education with multiple faculties of sciences in 1846; gained university status in 1933.\nFormally established as the Tounis College (Town's College) under the authority of a royal charter granted to the Town of Edinburgh by King James VI of Scotland on 14 April 1582.[121][122] It opened its doors to students in October 1583.[123]\nEstablished under the authority of the University of Durham Act 1832.[127] Recognised as a university in the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and the Established Church Act 1836.[128][129] Incorporated and confirmed by Royal Charter in 1837 and degrees granted equal privileges with those of Oxford and Cambridge by the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1837.[130][131]\nFounded by Royal Charter in 1893 as a federal university with three constituent colleges \u2013 Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff \u2013 the university was the first and oldest university in Wales. Listed by R\u00fcegg as meeting standard criteria for recognition as a university from 1893[142]\nThe university was founded as St David's College (Coleg Dewi Sant) in 1822 \"to provide a liberal education to members of the clergy\" and was incorporated by royal charter in 1828.[143] It was renamed St David's University College (Coleg Prifysgol Dewi Sant) in 1971, when it became part of the federal University of Wales. It was again renamed University of Wales, Lampeter in 1996 in line with moves elsewhere in the University of Wales. In 2010 it merged with Trinity University College to form the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David.[144] Although described as the oldest university in Wales,[145][146] it was not listed by R\u00fcegg as meeting standard criteria for a university[147] and lost a court case in 1951 against the Ministry of Education in which it sought to receive recognition as a university.[148]\nFounded in 1872 as University College Wales, offering courses leading to degrees of the University of London, it became a founder member of the University of Wales in 1894.[149] It claims to be \"Wales's oldest university\",[150] but was listed by R\u00fcegg as a college of the University of Wales rather than as a university.[142] It became an independent university (as Aberystwyth University) in 2007.[151]\nCreated in 1920 as University of Rio de Janeiro.[152] Has as precursors the Polytechnic School (founded as Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design in 1792),[153] the National College of Medicine (founded as Academy of Medicine and Surgery in 1808)[154] and by the National College of Law (founded in 1891).[155][156]\nThe first institution dedicated to higher education in Costa Rica was the University of Saint Thomas (Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s), which was established in 1843. That institution maintained close ties with the Catholic Church and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and anti-clerical government of President Bernardo Soto Alfaro as part of a campaign to modernize public education. The schools of law, agronomy, fine arts, and pharmacy continued to operate independently. In 1940, those four schools were re-united to establish the modern UCR, during the reformist administration of President Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia.\nFounded in 1540 as Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s Obispo (St. Nicholas Bishop College) and later in 1543 was appointed Real Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s Obispo (Royal St. Nicholas Bishop College) by King Carlos I of Spain; it was converted into a university on 15 October 1917.[158]\nAlso known as the \"Dean university of the Americas\"; It is the first officially established (privilege by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) and the longest continuously operating university in the Americas.\nEstablished by act of legislature in 1962. Opened in 1963 as the College of the Virgin Islands, offering only associate degrees. First bachelor's degree programmes 1967. Became the University of the Virgin Islands in 1986.[159]\nIn the United States, the colonial colleges awarded degrees from their foundation, but none were formally named as universities prior to the American Revolution, leading to various claims to be the first university in the United States. The earliest Canadian institutions were founded as colleges, without degree awarding powers, and gained degree granting authority and university status later.\nFirst campus opened in Jamaica as the University College of the West Indies associated with the University of London in 1948. Gained independent university status in 1962. Bermuda joined the university in 2009.[160] Bermuda has also had a community college, Bermuda College, since 1974.\nTraces its roots back to the King's College in New York City, which was first founded in 1754. Following the American Revolution, Loyalists at the college fled to Windsor, Nova Scotia, and established as the King's Collegiate School in 1789. It received a royal charter in 1802 establishing it (after the model of Trinity College Dublin) as \"The Mother of a University\", making it the oldest chartered university in Canada.[161][162][163] A fire destroyed the original university in 1920, and the institution relocated to Halifax.\nFounded in 1636, named Harvard College in 1639, chartered in 1650. Oldest institution of higher education in the United States. Officially recognised as a university by the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780.[166][167]\nChartered in 1693. Claims to be the \"first college to become a university\" in the US, in 1779.[168] Named as a studium generale in its royal charter, leading to the additional claim that it was \"a university by grant, a studium generale ex privilegio as the medieval jurists would have said it, since 1693\".[169]\nBriefly closed during two different periods: from 1861 to 1869 due to the Civil War and postwar financial problems, and 1882 to 1888 due to continued financial difficulties.\n^\"The statement that all universities are descended either directly or by migration from these three prototypes [Oxford, Paris, and Bologna] depends, of course, on one's definition of a university. And I must define a university very strictly here. A university is something more than a center of higher education and study. One must reserve the term university for\u2014and I'm quoting Rashdall here\u2014'a scholastic guild, whether of masters or students, engaged in higher education and study,\" which was later defined, after the emergence of universities, as \"studium generale'.\"[4]\n^\"No one today would dispute the fact that universities, in the sense in which the term is now generally understood, were a creation of the Middle Ages, appearing for the first time between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medievalWest, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities.Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. We are therefore concerned with what is indisputably an original institution, which can only be defined in terms of a historical analysis of its emergence and its mode of operation in concrete circumstances.\"[10]\n^\"Thus the university, as a form of social organization, was peculiar to medieval Europe. Later, it was exported to all parts of the world, including the Muslim East; and it has remained with us down to the present day. But back in the Middle Ages, outside of Europe, there was nothing anything quite like it anywhere.\"[11]\n^The Court of Cassation of Belgium ruled 26 November 1846, that this new Catholic University of Louvain founded in Mechlin in 1834 does not have any links with the Old University of Louvain founded in 1425 and abolished in 1797 and can not be regarded as continuing it: \"The Catholic University of Louvain can not be regarded as continuing the old University of Louvain\", in, Table g\u00e9n\u00e9rale alphab\u00e9tique et chronologique de la Pasicrisie Belge contenant la jurisprudence du Royaume de 1814 \u00e0 1850, Brussels, 1855, p. 585, column 1, alinea 2.

There is no indication, however, that up until around 1180, the Bolognese law schools were anything other than private schools opened and run by each master after his own fashion, gathering together the students that had entered into an agreement with him and paid him fees (collectae) in return for his teaching. The crucial change would seem to have taken place around the years 1180\u201390. ... The masters, who were themselves mainly Bolognese in origin, agreed from 1189 to swear an oath to the commune not to seek to transfer the studium elsewhere. The students, on the other hand, began to group themselves in nations, according to their places of origin (we hear of the Lombard nation as early as 1191), and these were soon federated into 'universities' with elected rectors at their head.{{cite book}}: |work= ignored (help)\n^Paul F.

The first indications of the gestation of a scholars' guild comes from Bologna in 1189 when the commune forced the masters to swear not to transfer the studium to another town. Thereafter, evidence confirming that Bologna had become a universitas and announcing similar developments elsewhere proliferate. The collective identity of the many Paris schools received some sort of official recognition in 1194 when their scholars were implicitly given a grant of clerical immunity by Pope Celestine III, which were confirmed six years later by the king, Philip II. By 1208 a university had definitely begun to take shape. In that year the city's bishop, who claimed the right to license private teachers and interfere in their teaching, accepted that the masters could form an autonomous guild and police themselves, albeit under his ultimate control. In 1215 the pope blessed this arrangement by granting the fledgling university is first statutes.\n^Jacques Verger (16 October 2003). Hilde de Ridder-Symoens; Walter R\u00fcegg (eds.).

        "context": "\nAt 2:30 on March 2, 1959, the 32-year-old trumpet player and bandleader Miles Davis took six sidemen into a New York City studio, where they spent the afternoon and early evening recording three songs. On April 22, the same cohort, minus one of the two piano players who worked on the first date, returned to the same studio and recorded two more songs. As far as the musicians were concerned, that was the end of the story. For the rest of the world, it was just beginning. Four months later, the five selections were released on the album \"Kind of Blue.\" The record became an immediate success, embraced by jazz fans, critics and musicians. Two songs on the album, \"So What\" and \"All Blues,\" quickly became staples in the jazz repertoire. \"So What\" even became a favorite of college and high-school marching bands. Meanwhile, the record kept selling, and selling and selling. Today, 50 years after it was released, \"Kind of Blue\" remains the bestselling jazz album of all time. More than 4 million copies have been sold, and the album still sells an average of 5,000 copies a week. If you have a jazz album on your shelf, odds are it's \"Kind of Blue.\"\nWhy this album? Out of the thousands of jazz albums ever recorded, why does \"Kind of Blue\" maintain its hold on our imaginations more than any other? The simplest response is to say, because it's beautiful. You won't find many recordings that boast more thoughtful compositions or performances of any higher caliber than the solos and ensemble work of Davis, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb. The music has no weak spots. Or perhaps it's the unthreatening nature of the music: five medium-tempo selections, all played at the level of human conversation. There's nothing in these songs that would scare anyone. On the other hand, there are none of the signposts or road maps that make jazz accessible to listeners\u2014no standards that you can hum, no vocals. And yet, even when you hear this album for the first time, it's like meeting an old friend. It sounds familiar somehow. Even today, at 50, \"Kind of Blue\" sounds, as Quincy Jones puts it, \"like it was made yesterday.\"\nOld yet new, strange but familiar\u2014how can music possess such contrary qualities and still sound coherent? In the case of this album, it's because the music was designed that way. It coheres because it was conceived as a whole. Each cut contributes to the whole (in this sense, it might better be titled \"Kinds of Blue\"). One of the most important elements built in from the start was an open-ended sense of discovery and exploration. The men who performed on the two recording dates knew almost nothing about the music they would play before they entered the studio. As Bill Evans, the principal piano player on both recording dates, wrote in his liner notes for the album, \"Miles conceived these settings only hours before the recording dates and arrived with sketches which indicated to the group what was to be played. Therefore, you will hear something close to pure spontaneity in these performances.\"\nDavis's sketches, at least a couple of them collaborations with Evans, are more like themes or motifs than fleshed-out songs. But this was the beauty of the challenge: the score demanded a lot of the players that day, because it left so much space for a soloist to fill. The musicians responded by giving the space between the notes the same weight they gave what is played. Their silences really are golden. Listening to these performances is to be reminded of Robert Frost's dictum about the making of a great poem: \"No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.\"\nYou don't have to know any music theory to appreciate this music, but understanding the context in which it was created does help clarify what Davis was trying to do. Since the '40s, jazz had been dominated by bebop and then hard bop, music characterized by frenetic tempos and chord changes stacked upon chord changes. It required deep musical sophistication to play that style, but while Davis had the chops for bop\u2014had indeed been one of its prime movers\u2014he had lost his enthusiasm. \"I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords,\" he told an interviewer six months before the recording of this album. \"There will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them. Classical composers\u2014some of them\u2014have been writing this way for years, but jazz musicians seldom have.\" So he deliberately went another way with \"Kind of Blue,\" supplying the barest hint of a song in each case, giving his musicians the scale or scales upon which to improvise and then turning them loose to create their own melodies and variations. It was a return to and an exaltation of lyricism.\n\"Kind of Blue\" draws on the two essential tributaries of jazz\u2014improvisation and the blues\u2014to create music full of space and possibility, certainly music that appealed to players and listeners alike.\nCritics have never stopped writing about \"Kind of Blue,\" and Ashley Kahn's absorbing 2000 book, \"Kind of Blue,\" is devoted exclusively to the making of this classic album and its lasting influence. Columbia (now Sony) has kept the album in print since it first appeared. In the past year it has released two different commemorative editions that include not only the original album but also false starts, studio chatter, the one alternate take of \"Flamenco Sketches\" and a previously unreleased live version of \"So What.\" There are also excellent critical essays and a DVD that contains a gushing documentary on the album and a terrific tape of a 1959 television show on which Davis played \"So What\" with his combo and three big-band numbers arranged and conducted by Gil Evans. The more deluxe of these sets even includes a blue vinyl copy of the record. It is a testament to the original album's undiminished potency that none of this feels like overkill.\n\"Kind of Blue\" has little historical import beyond its musical influence, but it makes a terrific cultural milestone against which we can measure a half century of change. Certainly the album made Davis a star\u2014yes, in 1959 jazz musicians could still be pop stars\u2014and in doing that it put before the public a black man unafraid to speak his mind and unwilling to compromise his art to please or appease anyone. In the materials accompanying the anniversary editions of the album, there is a picture of Davis draping his arms over pianist Bill Evans while demonstrating something on the keyboard. Today the picture seems innocuous, but in 1959 it could have caused a riot in certain parts of this country: a black man almost hugging a white man, a black man instructing a white man, a black man who was the white man's boss. It is a measure of just how polarizing a figure Davis was that he took criticism from both the white and the black communities. While Evans was a member of the band, Davis got an earful from black people who thought he should hire only African-Americans. In his public pronouncements, Davis could be intemperate, petulant and contrarian, but when it came to his music, he was always clearheaded and colorblind.\nIn 1959, jazz was more broadly popular than it is today\u2014jazz was on the jukebox in '59\u2014but it was still fighting for its place in the American cultural pantheon. It would be decades before anyone began calling it America's classical music (in 1965, when the music jury for the Pulitzer Prize voted to give the award to Duke Ellington, the Pulitzer board vetoed the decision). The battle is over now. Public schools teach jazz appreciation. Every major musical conservatory has a jazz department. Lincoln Center devotes two concert halls and a nightclub to jazz. Some of the excitement and sense of discovery that characterized the music at midcentury has leaked away in subsequent decades, but jazz still attracts new players, composers and audiences, and its influence is everywhere. Even the president of the United States boasts of having Charlie Parker, John Coltrane and Miles Davis on his iPod.\nIt would be foolish to credit \"Kind of Blue\" as the single tipping point in the debate, but considering its enormous popularity, it would be equally silly to ignore its influence. Millions of fans first encountered not just Miles Davis but jazz itself on this album, and it continues to define the form for new generations (almost half its sales have come in the past two decades). At a time when what is popular and what is good seem ever more divergent, \"Kind of Blue\" sounds better all the time.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.",

In total, he scored 59 international goals in 68 matches, playing his last match on 10 April 1927.[a][9] He remained the highest international goalscorer for 26 years, until his fellow countryman Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s broke the record in 1953. Pusk\u00e1s was the third player, after Poul Nielsen of Denmark, to achieve 50 goals in his international career.[11][12] Nielsen achieved this feat on his 36th cap against Sweden in the 1924\u201328 Nordic Football Championship on 14 June 1925 and scored 52 goals in just 38 matches in his international career.[13][14][15] Pusk\u00e1s netted his 50th goal on 24 July 1952, when he scored a brace in the semi-final match against Turkey at the 1952 Summer Olympics.[16] However, Vivian Woodward scored 75 goals in 53 matches considered official internationals by the opposing sides, which would make him the first footballer to score 50 or more international goals, ahead of Imre Schlosser, and was the fastest to achieve the feat, scoring his 50th goal in his 32nd official international match, with a four-goal haul against Hungary on 31 May 1909.[17]\nPusk\u00e1s overall scored 84 goals in his international career,[11] and remained the highest international goalscorer for 24 years following his 84th goal in 1956 against Austria, until Mokhtar Dahari of Malaysia broke the record in the Merdeka Tournament after scoring his 85th goal on 27 October 1980 against Kuwait and he went on to score 89 goals for his country in 142 international appearances.[18][19][20] In 2004, Ali Daei of Iran broke the record after scoring his 90th goal against Lebanon.[21][22]\nDaei also became the first player to score over 100 goals in international football, ending his career with 109 in total.[23][24] His 100th goal came on 17 November 2004, when he scored a four-goal haul against Laos in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match.[25] However, the first player from Asia to reach 50 international goals was Malaya's Abdul Ghani Minhat. Furthermore, he was also the first player from outside Europe to achieve it. He achieved the feat on 15 December 1961 against Thailand and he went on to score 58 goals in 57 international appearances for his country which is 1.02 per match, making him one of the most prolific players in the world.[26][27][28] Just two years after Pusk\u00e1s' scored his 50th goal, his teammate S\u00e1ndor Kocsis did the same on 19 September 1954, in a friendly match against Romania.[29] He became both the fourth player and the fourth European to achieve the feat. He went on to score a total of 75 goals in 65 matches in international football.[30]Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal was the second player to score 100 international goals, as well as the first European to achieve the feat. He reached the milestone after scoring a brace against Sweden in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League on 8 September 2020.[31]Lionel Messi of Argentina became the third player to reach and pass the milestone in a friendly match against Cura\u00e7ao on 28 March 2023, as well as the first South American to achieve the feat.[32][33][34]\nPel\u00e9 of Brazil was the first player from South America to score at least 50 international goals. He attained this in a friendly match against the Soviet Union on 21 November 1965, and went on to score 77 international goals in 92 matches.[35]Malawi's Kinnah Phiri was the first player from Africa, and also the youngest player, to score 50 international goals. He scored his 50th goal in a friendly match against Sierra Leone on 6 July 1978, aged 23 years, 8 months and 6 days.[36]Stern John of Trinidad and Tobago was the first player from North America to score 50 international goals.

The cases all last a maximum of three days, with the judge determining the outcome based on evidence presented by the defense attorney and the prosecutor.\nThe series was created by the writer and director Shu Takumi. He wanted the series to end after the third game, but it continued, with Takeshi Yamazaki taking over as writer and director starting with Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth (2009); Takumi has since returned to write and direct some spin-off titles. The series has been well received, with reviewers liking the characters and story, and the finding of contradictions; it has also performed well commercially, with Capcom regarding it as one of their strongest intellectual properties. The series has been credited with helping to popularize visual novels in the Western world. As of June 30, 2023, the game series has sold 10 million copies worldwide.[3]\nAce Attorney Investigations 2 is the second entry in the Investigations series. It was released for the Nintendo DS in 2011 in Japan;[8] it has also been released for Android and iOS in 2017.[39] It has not been released in the West and, as of 2023, is the only game in the series that has not had an official English language translation.[40]\nThe Great Ace Attorney Chronicles contains both games in The Great Ace Attorney series: Adventures and 2: Resolve. It was released in July 2021 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows. This was the first time both games were made officially available outside of Japan.[53]\nApollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy contains the fourth through sixth mainline games: Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies, and Spirit of Justice. It is set for release on January 25, 2024 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One.[54]\nA cross-examination in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The player can move between statements, press the witness for details, and present evidence that contradicts the testimony.\nThe Ace Attorney games are visual noveladventure games[55] in which the player controls defense attorneys and defends their clients in several different episodes.[56][57][58] The gameplay is split into two types of sections: investigations and courtroom trials.[59][60] During the investigations, the player searches the environments, gathering information and evidence, and talks to characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police.[59] Once enough evidence has been collected, the game moves on to a courtroom trial section.[61][62]\nIn the courtroom trials, the player aims to get their client declared \"not guilty\". To do so, they cross-examine witnesses,[59] and aim to find lies and inconsistencies in the testimonies. They are able to go back and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement.[63][64] If the player is correct, the game presents a sequence that often starts with the protagonist shouting \"Objection!\" and pointing at the witness along with a shift in music before they begin to grill the witness with the inconsistency, which has become an iconic aspect of the series.[65] The player is penalized if they present incorrect evidence: in the first game, a number of exclamation marks are shown, with one disappearing after each mistake the player makes;[66] in later games, a health bar that represents the judge's patience is used instead; and in 3DS games, the character's lawyer badge is used.[67][68][69] If all exclamation marks or lawyer badges are lost, or the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty.[66][67][69]\nSeveral Ace Attorney games introduce new gameplay mechanics to the series. Justice for All introduces \"psyche-locks\", which are shown over a witness when the player asks them about a topic they do not want to discuss; using a magatama, the player can start breaking the psyche-locks by showing the witness evidence or character profiles that proves they are hiding something. The number of psyche-locks depends on how deep the secret is; when all locks are broken, the topic becomes available, giving the player access to new information.[70][71]Apollo Justice introduces the \"perceive\" system, where the player looks for motions or actions made by witnesses that show nervousness, similar to a tell in poker.[72]\nDual Destinies introduces the \"mood matrix\", through which the player can gauge the emotions of a witness, such as tones of anger when mentioning certain topics;[73][74] if the player notices a contradictory emotional response during testimony, they can point out the discrepancy and press the witness for more information.[75]Dual Destinies also introduces \"revisualization\",[76][77] where the player reviews vital facts and forms links between evidence to reach new conclusions.[76]Spirit of Justice introduces \"divination s\u00e9ances\", in which the player is shown the memories of victims moments before their deaths, and must find contradictions in the victim's five senses to determine what has happened.[78]Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney introduces simultaneous cross-examinations of multiple witnesses, with the player being able to see and hear reactions from the different witnesses to the testimony and using this to find contradictions.[79]The Great Ace Attorney introduces \"joint reasoning\", where the player finds out the truth by pointing out when their investigative partner Herlock Sholmes takes his reasoning \"further than the truth\".[80]\nThe Ace Attorney Investigations spin-off series splits the gameplay into investigation phases and rebuttal phases, the latter of which is similar to the courtroom trials of the main series.[81][82][83] During the investigation phases, the player searches for evidence and talks to witnesses and suspects. Things the player character notices in the environment are saved as thoughts; the player can use the \"logic\" system to connect two such thoughts to gain access to new information.[81][84] At some points, the player can create hologram reproductions of the crime scene,[81][85] through which they can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden.[86]Ace Attorney Investigations 2 introduces \"logic chess\", where the player interrogates witnesses in a timed sequence that is visualized as a game of chess, with the player aiming to destroy the other character's chess pieces. To do this, they need to build up their advantage in the discussion by alternating between speaking and listening, and then choose to go on the offensive.[83][87][88]\nThe protagonist of the first three games is the defense attorney Phoenix Wright (Ry\u016bichi Naruhod\u014d in the Japanese version), who is assisted by the spirit medium Maya Fey;[89] in the third game, Phoenix's mentor Mia Fey is also a playable character.[57] In the fourth game, the protagonist is the defense attorney Apollo Justice;[90] in the fifth, Phoenix, Apollo and the new defense attorney Athena Cykes are all protagonists;[91] and in the sixth, Phoenix and Apollo are the main protagonists, while Athena is playable in one case.[92] The spin-off The Great Ace Attorney is set in England near the end of the 19th century, and follows Phoenix's ancestor Ryunosuke Naruhodo.[93]\nPhoenix's childhood friend Miles Edgeworth, who is the protagonist of the Ace Attorney Investigations games,[81][83] is a recurring rival prosecutor character; in addition to him, each new game in the series introduces a new rival:[89]Franziska von Karma is introduced in the second game,[94]Godot in the third,[95] Klavier Gavin in the fourth,[96] Simon Blackquill in the fifth,[97] Nahyuta Sahdmadhi in the sixth,[98] Barok van Zieks in Adventures,[99] and Kazuma Asogi in Resolve.[100] Most of the prosecutor characters are portrayed as powerful and arrogant characters of high social status and who care about keeping perfect-win records in court, and even may favor convictions over finding the truth, although most have secret motivations and sympathetic backstories and typically help the protagonist at the game's climax. Similarly to real Japanese prosecutors, the prosecutors in the series often directly oversee investigations, issuing orders to the police. Japanese attitudes towards the police force are reflected in the series, with the police being represented by incompetent characters such as Dick Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde and Mike Meekins.[101] In the world of Ace Attorney, trials only last three days, and usually end with a \"guilty\" verdict, with trials taken up by the protagonists of the games being rare exceptions.[89] The outcomes of cases are decided by a judge, based on evidence provided by the defense attorney and the prosecutor.[101]\nThe series was created by Shu Takumi(left); starting with Investigations, it has been handled by producer Motohide Eshiro (pictured, right) and director Takeshi Yamazaki.\nThe series was created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and directed the first three games.[102] The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and felt that this was a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator.[103] The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play.[94] It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.[104]\nTakumi cited Japanese mystery author Edogawa Ranpo as an inspiration, particularly The Psychological Test, a short story which involves a crime that \"unravels due to the criminal's contradictory testimony.\" It had a big impact on him, and was a major influence on the game. He was also inspired by stories from another Japanese author, Shinichi Hoshi, stating that he was pursuing his \"element of surprise and unexpectedness.\"[105]\nTakumi felt that the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them together into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear.[106] He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along.[106] He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.[106]\nAfter the first game's development was finished, Mikami told Takumi that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case.[107] Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game,[108] but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular. This led to Takumi feeling that he had to use the character more carefully and sparingly; he created the new prosecutor character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he\u2014a supposed prodigy\u2014loses every case.[94] As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes between games: art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for All.[108]\nFor the fourth game, Takumi wrote the scenario and took on a supervisory role.[55][109] He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said that it is important to know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it.[110] Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro;[111][112] Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.[113] He also directed and wrote The Great Ace Attorney, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series.[41] He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school.[114] Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice.[115][116][117] Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.[117] In 2020, Yamazaki left Capcom.[118]\nThe localization of the first game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States: because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it.[119] The Japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.[120]\nThe change in the series' setting became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.[119] Starting with the second game, the series localization direction has been handled by Janet Hsu;[94] One of the first decisions she had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She came up with the idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed, such as changing Maya's favorite food from ramen to burgers. That particular change was mocked by players as the dish later became more well known in the West, and was lampshaded in the English release of Spirit of Justice, where Maya is described as liking both ramen and burgers.[94][121]\nCharacter names were also localized to use double meanings similarly to the Japanese names;[120] the name puns were based on the characters' personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags.[122] Several English names were based on their Japanese counterparts, but for some characters the names had to be altered heavily compared to the Japanese versions.[120] Smith and Anderson had a lot of freedom when localizing the names of minor characters in the first game, but discussed the names of the main cast with Capcom. Phoenix's English surname, \"Wright\", was chosen as his Japanese name, \"Naruhod\u014d\"\u2014meaning \"I see\" or \"I understand\"\u2014was frequently used as a joke in the script.[119]\nDual Destinies was given a digital-only release in the West as to release the English version as close to the Japanese release date as possible while maintaining a tight development schedule.[30] Its follow-up, Spirit of Justice, was released in the same manner. Although Ace Attorney Investigations 2 has not been officially localized, an English fan translation has been made.[40] Both The Great Ace Attorney games were released in the West with English localization in July 2021 as part of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles,[53] making Ace Attorney Investigations 2 the only game in the series to remain a Japan-only release.\nThe Ace Attorney series has been well received by critics,[123][124][125][126][129][132] and has performed well commercially: in December 2009, it was Capcom's 9th-best-selling series of all time,[134] and in October 2010, they called it one of their \"strongest intellectual properties\", with more than 3.9 million units sold worldwide.[135] By December 2013, the series had sold over 5 million units.[136] In the United States, the first game became surprisingly successful, forcing Capcom to prepare at least three additional runs to meet the demand.[137] By June 2018, the series had sold over 6.7 million units.[138] As of June 30, 2023, the game series has sold 10 million copies worldwide.[3]\nGeoff Thew at Hardcore Gamer said that the \"craziness\" of the game world makes the cases entertaining, but also that it \"resonates on a deeper level\" due to its connection to the real Japanese legal system, making the setting still feel relevant in 2014.[89] Bob Mackey at USgamer said that the Ace Attorney games were among the best written games of all time, and that the series' strength is how each game builds up to a \"stunning and satisfying finale\".[139] Thomas Whitehead at Nintendo Life also liked the writing, praising its balance between \"light-hearted nonsense\" and darker, more serious scenarios.[140] Several reviewers have appreciated the series' characters;[83][89][139][141] Thew said that Phoenix and Maya's banter is among the best in video games, and that Edgeworth's character arc is one of the most compelling parts of the stories.[89]\nReviewers have liked finding contradictions;[1][142] a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity,[56][143][144] as well as how the player sometimes has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order.[57][70][142][145] Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series,[81][16][144] while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this.[83][144]\nSeveral reviewers have praised the series' music.[89][139] They said that the greatest aspect of the series is its audio design, with the first three games using the Game Boy Advance sound chip better than any other game for that platform; he called the music phenomenal, with the exception of that in Justice for All, but said the sound effects are what \"steals the show\".[89] Mackey commented that the games' small amounts of animations for each character are used well for their characterization.[139]\nThe Takarazuka Revue, an all-female theater troupe, has adapted the series into stage musicals: 2009's Ace Attorney: Truth Resurrected, which is based on the last episode of the first game;[146] 2010's Ace Attorney 2: Truth Resurrected Again, whose first act is an original story, and whose second is based on the final episode of the second game;[147] and 2013's Ace Attorney 3: Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, which is set before the events of Truth Resurrected Again.[148] A stage play based on the series, titled Gyakuten no Spotlight, ran in 2013, and was written by Eisaku Saito.[149] A 2012 live-action film adaptation of the first game, titled Ace Attorney, was produced at the film studio Toei and directed by Takashi Miike.[150][151] A 2016 TV anime adaptation of the series, Ace Attorney, was produced at A-1 Pictures and directed by Ayumu Watanabe.[4]\nKodansha has published several manga based on the series: a short story anthology was published in Bessatsu Young Magazine in 2006; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney and Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth were serialized in Weekly Young Magazine in 2007 and 2009, respectively; and another manga, which is based on the anime, was published in V Jump in 2016.[152] A novel based on the series, Gyakuten Saiban: Turnabout Idol, was released in June 2016.[153]Ace Attorneydrama CDs,[154][155]soundtrack albums,[156][157] and figurines have also been released.[158][159][160]\nThe Ace Attorney series has been credited with helping to popularise visual novels in the Western world.[173][174]Vice magazine credits the Ace Attorney series with popularising the visual novel mystery format,[175] and notes that its success anticipated the resurgence of point-and-click adventure games as well as the international success of Japanese visual novels.[176] According to Danganronpa director Kazutaka Kodaka, Ace Attorney's success in North America was due to how it distinguished itself from most visual novels with its gameplay mechanics, which Danganronpa later built upon and helped it also find success in North America.[174]\nAce Attorney is referenced in several anime shows. In a murder mystery arc of the 2006 anime series Haruhi Suzumiya, the show's titular character mimics Phoenix Wright during an episode.[183] The 2014 anime series No Game No Life also pays homage to the game during an episode.[184]\nIn early 2021, a user on Reddit created a bot that took selected Reddit forum arguments into short movies fashioned after Ace Attorney courtroom battles between the games' various characters.[65] A similar bot was later created for the platform X (commonly known as Twitter).[185]",

Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[18]\nA lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five \u2013 Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel \u2013 to call themselves co-founders.[19]\nElon Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[20] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[21]\nIn February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[22][17] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[23] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[23]\nTesla's first car, the Roadster, was officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in Santa Monica, California, at a 350-person invitation-only event held in Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.[24]\nIn August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[25] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[26] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[27] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[27] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[28]\nTesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[29][30] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[31]\nIn May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, from Toyota for $42 million,[35] and opened the facility in October 2010 to start production of the Model S.[36] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[37] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[38]\nIn January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[39] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[40] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[41] The Model S was also the bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[42]\nTesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[43]\nTesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[44] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[45]\nTesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[46][47]\nTesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[48] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[49] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[50] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[51]\nTesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. Compared to Tesla's previous luxury vehicles, the Model 3 was less expensive and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[52] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3. Instead, the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles,[53] leading to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company would later come to describe as \"production hell.\"[54][55] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 would become the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[56][57]\nThis period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[58][59] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain CEO.\nFrom July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[60] Tesla was added to the index on December 21, 2020.[61] It was the most valuable company ever added, already the sixth-largest member.[61] During 2020, the share price increased 740%,[62] and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached $848 billion,[63] more than the next nine largest automakers combined and becoming the US' 5th most valuable company.[64][65] In July 2020, Tesla reached a valuation of $206 billion, surpassing Toyota to become the world's most valuable automaker.[66] On August 31, 2020, Tesla completed a 5-for-1 stock split.[67]\nDuring this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[71] The first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[72]Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[73] and production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[74]Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[75] and production of the Model Y began in April 2022.[76] Tesla has also announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[77]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the entire automotive industry, and Tesla was no exception. Government officials in China closed Gigafactory Shanghai and lawmakers in California shut down production at the Tesla Fremont Factory. While China allowed Tesla to resume production a few weeks later, California did not. Tesla would ultimately defy state orders, and restart production on May 11, 2020.[78]\nAfter the dispute with California officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[79][80] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[81] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[82]\nTesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[83] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[84] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[85] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[86] In July 2022 it was reported that Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[87]\nThe Model S is a full-size luxury car with a liftback body style and a dual motor, all-wheel drive layout. Development of the Model S began prior to 2007 and deliveries started in June 2012. The Model S has seen two major design refreshes, first in April 2016 which introduced a new front-end design and again in June 2021 which revised the interior. The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016. Since its introduction, more than 250,000 vehicles have been sold.\nThe Model X is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV offered in 5-, 6- and 7-passenger configurations with either a dual- or tri-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The rear passenger doors open vertically with an articulating \"falcon-wing\" design. A prototype Model X was first shown in February 2012 and deliveries started in September 2015.[88] The Model X shares around 30 percent of its content with the Model S. The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in June 2021 which revised the interior.\nThe Model 3 is a mid-size car with a fastback body style and either a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout or a rear-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model S sedan. A prototype Model 3 was first shown in 2016 and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[52] Deliveries started in July 2017.[89] The Model 3 ranked as the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021,[90][91][92] and cumulative sales passed 1 million in June 2021.[8] The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in September 2023 which revised the exterior and interior.\nThe Model Y is a mid-size crossover SUV offered in 5- and 7-passenger configurations with a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model X SUV. A prototype Model Y was first shown in March 2019,[68] and deliveries started in March 2020.[70] The Model Y shared around 75 percent of its content with the Model 3.[69] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling car, the first ever electric vehicle to claim the title.[93]\nThe Tesla Semi Class 8semi-truck by Tesla, Inc. with a tri-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[94] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[95] As of July 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production,[3] and Tesla does not expect the truck to enter volume production before 2024, due to limited availability of the required 4680 battery cells.[96]\nThe Cybertruck is a pickup truck unveiled on November 21, 2019.[97] The truck's novel design made of flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel and bulletproof glass windows earned a mixed reception.[98][99][100] As of February 2023, Musk has stated that deliveries are planned to begin by the end of Q3 2023.[101]\nOn November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0\u201360 miles per hour (0\u201397 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0\u2013100 mph (0\u2013161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[102] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[103] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[103] The base price was set at $200,000.[103] Musk has said that the Roadster should ship in 2024.[104]\nThe original Tesla Roadster[106] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[107] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge.\nTesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[108]\nTesla service strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center, or a mobile technician is dispatched.[109][110] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[111]\nIn 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[112]\nSupercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers.\nTesla Supercharger station (V3) with ten charging posts\nThe Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California, Nevada and Arizona. As of September 2023[update], Tesla operates a network of 5,500 Supercharger stations with 50,000 connectors. The stations are primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,000), North America (over 2,000) and Europe (over 1,000). Superchargers supply electrical power at 72 kilowatts (kW), 100 kW, 150 kW or 250 kW, with the maximum amount increasing over the years as the company improves its technology.\n\"Destination Charger\" in North America\nTesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners setup the devices and set pricing.[113] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[114] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[115]\nThe company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[118] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[119] As of 2023, insurance was available in 12 states.[120]\nAs of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia. The company also offers insurance for Tesla vehicle owners with non-Tesla vehicles.[118]\nTesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[121] In 2022, the company deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 348 megawatts, an increase of 3 megawatts over 2021, and deployed 6.5 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 64% over 2021.[122]\nFor large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[126][127][128] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[129] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[130][131]\nAt the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[132] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[21][133] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The most recent models, the Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[134][135] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[136]\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[137][138] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[139][140] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[141][142] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[143] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[138] instead of near other auto dealerships.[144][145][146]\nAnalysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151]\nTesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154]\nTesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148]\nTesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visibleComparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors\nTesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries.\nTesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[158]\nBusiness analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[159]\nTesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[160] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[161]\nThe next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[161]\nFor vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[162] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[163] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product.\nFor vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[161]\nTesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[164][165] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[161]\nTesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[161] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO 4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[166] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[167] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[168]\nTesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[169][170][171][172] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[173] \u2013 and sold in 2021.[174] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[175][176] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[177][178]\nTesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[179] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[180]\nThe system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[181] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[182]\nTesla makes two kinds of electric motors. Its oldest design in production is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor[183] (which inspired the Tesla logo). These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\nNewer, higher efficiency permanent magnet motors have been in use since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017. They are currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[184] The permanent magnet motors are more efficient, especially in stop-start driving.[185]\nThe North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186]\nSince September 2014, all Tesla cars are shipped with sensors (initially hardware version 1 or \"HW1\") and software to support Autopilot.[188] Tesla upgraded its sensors and software in October 2016 (\"HW2\") to support full self-driving in the future.[189] HW2 includes eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar.[189] HW2.5 was released in mid-2017, and it upgraded HW2 with a second graphics processing unit (GPU) and, for the Model 3 only, a driver-facing camera.[190] HW3 was released in early 2019 with an updated and more powerful computer, employing a custom Tesla-designed system on a chip.[191]\nIn April 2019, Tesla announced that all of its cars will include Autopilot software (defined as just Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer (Beta)) as a standard feature moving forward.[192] Full self-driving software (Autopark, Navigate on Autopilot (Beta), Auto Lane Change (Beta), Summon (Beta), Smart Summon (Beta) and future abilities) is an extra cost option.[192]\nIn 2020, Tesla released software updates where its cars recognize and automatically stop at stop signs and traffic lights.[193][194][195] In May 2021, Tesla removed the radar sensor and radar features from its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, opting instead to rely on camera vision alone.[196][197][198] The New York Times reported in December 2021 that Musk \"repeatedly told members of the Autopilot team that humans could drive with only two eyes and that this meant cars should be able to drive with cameras alone,\" an analogy some experts and former Tesla engineers described as \"deeply flawed.\"[199] Similarly, a statistical analysis conducted in A Methodology for Normalizing Safety Statistics of Partially Automated Vehicles debunked a common Tesla claim that Autopilot reduced crash rates by 40 percent[200] by accounting for the relative safety of the given operating domain when using active safety measures.[201]\nFull Self-Driving (FSD) is an optional extension of Autopilot promoted as eventually being able to perform fully autonomous driving. At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017,[202] which as of July 2022[update] has not occurred.[203] The first beta version of the software was released on October 22, 2020, to a small group of testers.[204] The release of the beta has renewed concern regarding whether the technology is ready for testing on public roads.[205][206] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has called for \"tougher requirements\" for any testing of Autopilot on public roads.[207]\nTesla's approach to achieve full autonomy is different from that of other companies.[208] Whereas Waymo, Cruise, and other companies are relying on highly detailed (centimeter-scale) three-dimensional maps, lidar, and cameras, as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors in their autonomous vehicles, Tesla's approach is to use coarse-grained two-dimensional maps and cameras (no lidar) as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors.[208][209] Tesla claims that although its approach is much more difficult, it will ultimately be more useful, because its vehicles will be able to self-drive without geofencing concerns.[210] Tesla's self-driving software has been trained on over 20 billion miles driven by Tesla vehicles as of January 2021.[211] Tesla also designed a self-driving computer chip that has been installed in its cars since March 2019.[212]\nMost experts believe that Tesla's approach of trying to achieve full self-driving by eschewing lidar and high-definition maps is not feasible.[213][214][215] In March 2021, according to a letter that Tesla sent to the California Department of Motor Vehicles about FSD's capability \u2013 acquired by PlainSite via a public records request \u2013 Tesla stated that FSD is not capable of autonomous driving and is only at Society of Automotive Engineers Level 2 automation.[216] In a May 2021 study by Guidehouse Insights, Tesla was ranked last for both strategy and execution in the autonomous driving sector.[217] In October 2021, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called on Tesla to change the design of its Autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to Musk.[218]\nAhead of the start of production of the Model 3, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble vehicles. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[219] Grohmann Automation,[220] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[221] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[53]\nTesla uses massive casting machines (Giga Press) to make large single pieces of vehicle underbodies and to streamline production.[222] This saves time, labor, cost and factory space, replacing multiple robots that weld car parts together with a single machine.[223]\nIn September 2022, Tesla revealed prototypes of a humanoid robot named Optimus, which Musk has stated uses the same core software as FSD. During the presentations at Tesla's AI Day 2022, Musk suggested that, among other use cases, the finalized version of Optimus could be used in Tesla's car factories to help with repetitive tasks and relieve labor shortages.[224]\nIn July 2023, Tesla acquired Wiferion, a Germany-based developer of wireless charging systems for industrial vehicles and autonomous robots, which has since been operating as Tesla Engineering Germany GmbH.[225] Tesla sold the business to Munich-based Puls Group three months later, but retained its staff.[226][227]\nIn November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[228]\nThe company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2023[update], the company also operates more than 1,000 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3]\nTesla was founded in San Carlos, California.[244] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[245] Tesla's first retail store was opened in 2008 in Los Angeles.[246]\nTesla's first assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[247] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[35]\nTesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces Powerwalls, Powerpacks and Megapacks;[231] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic;[248] and Model 3 drivetrains.[249] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years.[250]\nAs part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[251][252] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[234] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[253]\nOn July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[254] Giga Texas is planned to be the main factory for the Tesla Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi; it will also produce Model 3 and Model Y cars for the Eastern United States.[255][242] On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of the facility in a public event.[76]\nOn December 1, 2021, Tesla relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto, California, to the Gigafactory site in Austin, Texas.[256]\nTesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[257][258] The location opened in 2022.\nTesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters.\nTesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[259] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[260] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[261]\nIn late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[262] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[263]\nTesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[264] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[265] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[266] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[267][268] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[268]\nTesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[270]\nIn July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[271] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[236] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[272]\nTesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[273] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[274]\nIn January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[275] The partnership was part of Panasonic's $1 billion investment over three years in facilities for lithium-ion cell research, development and production.[276]\nBeginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[277] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[278]\nTesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[234] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[279][280]\nIn March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[281]\nDaimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[287][288] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[289] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[290] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[291]\nTesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[292][293] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[294][295] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[296] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N\u22c5m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[297] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[298][299]\nIn May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[35]\nIn July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[300] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[301][302] based on components from the Roadster.[303]\nThe production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[304] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[305][306]\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[307] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[307][158] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[308][309]\nInitial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[310] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[311]\nIn 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[312] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[313]\nWomen feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[314] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[315] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[314] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[316]\nIn May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[317]\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[324] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[325]\nIn January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[326][327][328] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[329][330] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[331] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[332] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[333]\nIn September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[334][335]\nThe California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[339]\nThere have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[340]Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[341] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[342] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[343] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[344][345] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[346]\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[347] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[348]\nA consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[349] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[350] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[351][352] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[353]\nIn August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[354] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[355][356][357] Musk settled fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[358] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[358] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[359][360] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[361]\nIn September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[362] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[362] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[363][364]\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[141] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[144] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[365][366][367]\nTesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[368] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[141] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[144] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[111]\nIn January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[369] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[370] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[371]\nTesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[372] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[373] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[374]\nIn 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[360] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[375]\nIn July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[376]\nIn 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[377] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[378] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[379] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[380]\nIn June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[381] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[382][326] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[383][384]\nIn August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[385] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[386]\nIn May 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, awarding each of the 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit 136,000 Norwegian kroner ($16,000).[387]\nTesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[388][389] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[390] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[391] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[392] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[393] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[394] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[395] and physically demanding work.[396] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[397]\nIn July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[398]\nIn October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015\u20132016.[399][400] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[401][402] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[403] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[404] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[405]\nFew of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[406] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.\nTesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[407] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[408] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[409][410][78] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[411][412] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[413] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[414]\nIn May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[415] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[416] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[417] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[407][418]\nIn China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work \u2013 but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[419] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[419] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.\u2013Chinese relations, China's ongoing persecution of Uyghurs, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[419]\nTesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[420][421]\nA Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[422]\nTSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[423] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[424] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[425]Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[426]\nAccording to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[427]\nIn 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[428][429][430]\nMusk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[431][432] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[433] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[434] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[435] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[436] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[437] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[438]\nOn April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[439][440] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[441]\nIn October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[442] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015\u20132017 Model S and 2016\u20132017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[443][444]\nIn February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[445] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[446][447] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[448]\nAlso in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[449][450]\nIn June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[451]\nOn December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[452] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[453]\nIn September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[454][455] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[455]\nIn February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[456] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[457] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[458]\nTesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[459] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[460] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[461] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[462] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[463] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[464][465][466]\nA Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[467][468] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[469] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[470]\nAccording to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[471][472] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[473] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[473][474][475] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[476] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[477] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[478]\nA safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[479] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[480] Several Tesla fans responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[481]\nIn August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[482] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[483] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[484]\nIn September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[485] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[486] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[487]\nIn January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[488][489] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[490]\nIn June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[491]\nIn February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[492] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[493]\nIn May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[494] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[495]Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[496]\nTesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[497]\nIn 2022, Tesla ranked as the world's bestselling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 18%.[498] Tesla reported 2022 vehicle deliveries of 1,313,851 units, up 40% from 2021.[9][10] In March 2023, Tesla produced its 4 millionth car.[499]\nTesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[500] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[501] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[502]\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[10] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[10]\nOf the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[10]\nTesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[141]: 31\nIn February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[83] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[503][504] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[505][506]\nThe quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[507]\nTesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[514] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[515] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[516] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[517] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[515] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[515] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[518]Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[519] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[520] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[521]\nAnother criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[522] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[523]\n^ abBurns, Matt (October 8, 2014). \"A Brief History of Tesla\".

For example, Chinese and Arabic are sometimes considered single languages, but each includes several mutually unintelligiblevarieties, and so they are sometimes considered language families instead. Conversely, colloquialregisters of Hindi and Urdu are almost completely mutually intelligible, and are sometimes classified as one language, Hindustani. Such rankings should be used with caution, because it is not possible to devise a coherent set of linguistic criteria for distinguishing languages in a dialect continuum.[1]\nThere is no single criterion for how much knowledge is sufficient to be counted as a second-language speaker. For example, English has about 450 million native speakers but, depending on the criterion chosen, can be said to have as many as two billion speakers.[2]\nThere are also difficulties in obtaining reliable counts of speakers, which vary over time because of population change and language shift. In some areas, there is no reliable census data, the data is not current, or the census may not record languages spoken, or record them ambiguously. Sometimes speaker populations are exaggerated for political reasons, or speakers of minority languages may be underreported in favor of a national language.[3]",

Wikipedia's editions when combined, comprise more than 62 million articles, attracting around 2billion unique device visits per month and more than 14 million edits per month (about 5.2edits per second on average) as of November 2023[update].[7][8] As of November 2023[update], 25.56% of Wikipedia's traffic comes from the United States followed by Japan at 5.87%, United Kingdom at 5.44%, Germany at 5%, Russia at 4.78% and the remaining 53.36% split among other countries according to data provided by Similarweb.[9]\nIt has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[15][16] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.[17][18]\nVarious collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.[19] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[20] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][21] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[22] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[23][24] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[25] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.[26]\nThe domainswikipedia.com (later redirecting to wikipedia.org) and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001,[27] and January 13, 2001,[28] respectively. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001[20] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[29] and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[23] The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia.[30][31] Its integral policy of \"neutral point-of-view\"[32] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[23] Bomis originally intended it as a business for profit.[33]\nWikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.[36][37] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[38]\nCiting fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[39] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[40][41]\nThough the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[42] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[43] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.[44] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \"low-hanging fruit\"\u2014topics that clearly merit an article\u2014have already been created and built up extensively.[45][46][47]\nIn November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[48][49]The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.[50] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology.[51] Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\".[52] A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, \"The Decline of Wikipedia\", questioned this claim, revealing that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.[53] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline.[54] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated, \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.\"[55]\nThe number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.[56][57]\nCartogram showing number of articles in each European language as of January 2019.[update] One square represents 10,000 articles. Languages with fewer than 10,000 articles are represented by one square. Languages are grouped by language family and each language family is presented by a separate color.\nIn January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the United States, according to Comscore Networks.[58] With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11).[58] This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors.[59] In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month.[60] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\".[7] As of March 2023[update], it ranked 6th in popularity, according to Similarweb.[61] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through \"stigmergic accumulation\".[62][63]\nIn January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia;[67] in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument;[68] and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia.[69] In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.[70][71] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA.[72]\nOn January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.\"[73] Varma added, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\"[73] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\"[73] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.[74]\nAs of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,[75] from which cloud computing was the most cited page.[76]\nOn January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called \"Vector 2022\".[77][78] It featured a redesigned menu bar, moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool.[78][79] The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes.[77][80]\nDifferences between versions of an article are highlighted\nUnlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle regarding the security of its content, meaning that it waits until a problem arises to fix it.[81]\nDue to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[82] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.[83][84] A frequently vandalized article can be \"semi-protected\" or \"extended confirmed protected\", meaning that only \"autoconfirmed\" or \"extended confirmed\" editors can modify it.[85] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changes.[86] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as \"perhaps the most important\" means at its disposal to \"regulate its market of ideas\".[87]\nIn certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains \"stable versions\" of articles which have passed certain reviews.[88] Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012.[89] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[90]\nWikipedia's editing interface\nAlthough changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision.[note 6][91] On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a \"watchlist\" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes.[92] \"New pages patrol\" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.[93]\nIn 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\".[94]\nAny change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.[95] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.[96]\nObvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes.[97][98] However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.[99]\nIn the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[99] It remained uncorrected for four months.[99] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[100][101] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\".[99] The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.[102]\nWikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\".[103][104] It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added,[105] and criticized as creating a competitive[106] and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles.[107][108]\nTaha Yasseri of the University of Oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study.[109][110] Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at Wikipedia. He relied instead on \"mutually reverting edit pairs\", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, anarchism, and Muhammad.[110] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[110]\nContent in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.[111][112] By using the site, one agrees to the Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; some of the main rules are that contributors are legally responsible for their edits and contributions, that they should follow the policies that govern each of the independent project editions, and they may not engage in activities, whether legal or illegal, that may be harmful to other users.[113][114] In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the \"official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation\".[115]\nThe fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the \"Five pillars\", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.[116] The five pillars are:\nWikipedia is an encyclopedia\nWikipedia is written from a neutral point of view\nWikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute\nWikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility\nWikipedia has no firm rules\nThe rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus.[117] Editors can enforce the rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.[118] Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.[88]\nThe two most commonly used namespaces across all editions of Wikipedia are: The article namespace (which are the articles of the encyclopedia) and the category namespace (which are a collection of pages such as articles). In addition, there have been various books and reading list that are composed completely of articles and categories of a certain Wikipedia.\nAccording to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[119] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\", which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.[120] Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[121] It must not present original research.[122] A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.[119] Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[123] This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.[124] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[125]\nEditors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for \"adminship\",[129] which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.[130] Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.[130]\nBy 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.[131] In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.[132]\nOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\".[103]\nWikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field.[133]Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers.[133]: 62 A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.[133]: 83\nThe Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.[134] Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[135] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.[134] Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).[note 7] Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).[134] Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.[136] When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.[134]\nWikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[138] although not always with entirely negative connotations.[139] Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as \"anti-elitism\".[140]\nWikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[141] As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there.[142] Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\".[143] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: \"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\"[144] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[145]\nThe English Wikipedia has 6,745,060 articles, 46,473,677 registered editors, and 121,965 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.[146]\nEditors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\".[147] Editors who do not log in are in some sense \"second-class citizens\" on Wikipedia,[147] as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\",[148] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.[148]\nA 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\".[149] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users... 524 people... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\"[143] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\".[143]\nA 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[150] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[151] According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\".[152]\nSeveral studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[153] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.[154] Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[154]Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\".[citation needed][155] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[156]\nMost viewed editions of Wikipedia over timeMost edited editions of Wikipedia over time\nThere are currently 339 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of November 2023, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, German, Swedish, French, and Dutch Wikipedias.[158] The second and fourth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013[update] had created about half the articles on the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.\nSince Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color)[162] or points of view.[163]\nThough the various language editions are held to global policies such as \"neutral point of view\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.[164][165]\nJimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\".[166] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[167] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[168] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[169] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.[169] It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.[120]\nEstimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions[170]\nTranslated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.[171][172]\nA study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia.[170]\nOn March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\"[173] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.[173]\nIn contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.[173]\nCritics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\".[175] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's \"Undue Weight\" policy, concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.[176][177][178]\nJournalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic.[175][179] A 2008 article in Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.[180]\nIn 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that \"Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.\"[181]\nMultiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being ideologically biased. In February 2021, Fox News accused Wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much \"leftist bias\".[182] Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a \"propaganda\" for the left-leaning \"establishment\" and warned the site can no longer be trusted.[183] In 2022, libertarian John Stossel opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics.[184] Some studies highlight the fact that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a \u201cwestern cultural bias\u201d (or \u201cpro-western bias\u201d)[185] or \u201cEurocentric bias\u201d[186], reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, \u201csimilar biases that are found in the \u2018ivory tower\u2019 of academic historiography\u201d. Due to this persistent Eurocentrism, scholars like Carwil Bjork-James[187] or the authors of \u2018'The colonization of Wikipedia: evidence from characteristic editing behaviors of warring camps'\u2019[188] call for a \u201cdecolonization\u201d of Wikipedia.\nArticles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.[189] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.\"[190] Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\"[191] Others raised similar critiques.[192] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,[193][194] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.[195] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4\u00d7 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).[196]\nAs a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.[197] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity,[198] the insertion of false information,[199]vandalism, and similar problems.\nEconomist Tyler Cowen wrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.[200]Amy Bruckman has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, \"the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created\".[201] In September 2022, The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Liam Mannix noted that, \"There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate... And yet it [is].\" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as Encyclopedia Britannica, summarizing that, \"...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.\"[202]\nCritics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[203] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[204] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[205] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[206]\nWikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.[91][208]\nIn response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.[209] The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'\"[209][210][211][212][213] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.[214]\nLegal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\".[215]\nSome university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[216] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[217][218] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[219] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia\", he said.[220][221]\nIn February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.[222] In June 2007, Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association, condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\".[223]\nA 2020 research study published in Studies in Higher Education argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education \"flipped classroom\", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.[224]\nOn March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\"[225] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.[225] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\"[226] Beck added that: \"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\"[226]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(June 2023)\nWikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.[227] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).[228][229] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.[230] The \"Wikipedia is not censored\" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy.[231] The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[232] and Pakistan,[233] amongst other countries.[234][235][236]\nPie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January 2008[update][237]\nA 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field:[237]\nCulture and Arts: 30% (210%)\nBiographies and persons: 15% (97%)\nGeography and places: 14% (52%)\nSociety and social sciences: 12% (83%)\nHistory and events: 11% (143%)\nNatural and Physical Sciences: 9% (213%)\nTechnology and Applied Science: 4% (\u22126%)\nReligions and belief systems: 2% (38%)\nHealth: 2% (42%)\nMathematics and logic: 1% (146%)\nThought and Philosophy: 1% (160%)\nThese numbers refer only to the number of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its \"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.[238]\nA 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the \"people and arts\" category, while males focus more on \"geography and science\".[239]\nResearch conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, Africa being the most underrepresented.[240] Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.[241]\nAcademic studies of Wikipedia have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the \"average Wikipedian\", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15\u201349 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.[243] This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.[244][245] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia.[246][247] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[244]\nInterdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view.[246] In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\".[52] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.[53]\nWikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.[248] Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.[249]\nThe Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer\u2014a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions\u2014features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers.[251]\nIn April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.[252][253] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.[254] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.[254] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[255]Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[256] saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\"[256] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\".[257] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[258]\nOne privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a \"private citizen\" rather than a \"public figure\" in the eyes of the law.[259][note 8] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life. The Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy states, \"we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement\", and states that \"personal information\" may be shared \"For legal reasons\", \"To Protect You, Ourselves & Others\", or \"To Understand & Experiment\".[260]\nIn January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka \"Tron\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.[261]\nWikipedia has a \"Volunteer Response Team\" that uses Znuny, a free and open-source software fork of OTRS[262] to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.[263]\nIn late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the Online Safety Bill. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.[264]\nWikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment.[265][266] The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.[267]Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[268]\nIn May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media.[269][270] Five months later, Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics \"for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics\", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.[270][271] Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award G\u00e9rard Mourou.[270] Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for Quartz argued that \"it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.\"[272] Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.[272]\nA comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of Stony Brook University's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of Carnegie Mellon University found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. \"Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.\"[273]\nKatherine Maher, the third executive director of Wikimedia, served from 2016 to 2021\nWikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks.[274] The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[275][276] The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service Form 990 shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million.[277]\nIn May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.[278]TheWall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\"[279][280] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities\", Walsh said.[279]\nFollowing the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted,[281]Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.[282] Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to Bloomberg Businessweek regarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.\"[155]\nMaher served as executive director until April 2021.[283]Maryana Iskander was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.[284]\nWikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikim\u00e9dia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.[285]\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.[290]\nIn April 2005, a Lucene extension[291][292] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch.[293]\nIn July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.[294][295][296] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\".[297] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.[298]\nComputer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.[299][300][301] One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson, created articles with his bot Lsjbot, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.[302] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).[303] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.[300] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.[304] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.[305]\nAccording to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.[306]\nAs of 2021,[update] page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server.[307] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.[307] The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.[308]\nFollowing growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,[53] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.[315] Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the \"Thank\" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.[53][297] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.[316] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars,[317] the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.[316] In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually,[318] updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.[316]\nMultiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. Wikimedia's online newspaper The Signpost was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008.[319][320] The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wikipedia's sister projects.[321] Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the Wikiworld webcomic,[322] the Wikipedia Weekly podcast,[323] and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History[324] and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors.[325] There are also several publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as Wikimedia Diff[326] and This Month in Education.[327]\nThe Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia.[328][329] Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when ICE Publishing joined in 2020, a spokesman said \"By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources \u2013 creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.\"[330]\nWhen the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.[331] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.[332] In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.[333] Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.[334] In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[335][336][337][338]\nThe handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine,[339] while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.[340] Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.[341]\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.[342][343]\nBecause Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.[344] The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.\nCollections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles.[349] The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles,[350] the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles,[351] and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles.[352] Additionally, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and SOS Children, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.[353]\nThere have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.[354][355] Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.[356]\nThe website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia.[357] Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format, RDF.[358] As of February 2023,[update] it has over 101 million items.[359]WikiReader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by OpenMoko and first released in 2009.[360]\nObtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.[361] Wikipedia publishes \"dumps\" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023,[update] there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.[362]Wikimedia Enterprise is a for-profit solution to this.[363]\nSeveral languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.[364]\nA mobile version showing the English Wikipedia's Main Page, on August 3, 2019\nWikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik M\u00f6ller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.[7] The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\"[7]The New York Times reports that M\u00f6ller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[7]\nBloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013, with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.[365] At the time of the appointment of new Wikimedia Foundation executive Lila Tretikov, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Soon after, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.[280] The Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[366][367] The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[368]\nAccess to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service.[347] In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based devices.[369] Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.[370][371]\nWikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.[372][373] It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.[372]\nAndrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.[374][375] Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,[374] and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.[53] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[374][375]\nIn 2017\u201318, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.[13][14]Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.\"[14][382]\nIn February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month,... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\"[7] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.[383] The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.[384]\nIn addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[385] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[386] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.[387] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[388] In 2011, Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.[389]\nAccording to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.[390]\nAs of February 2023,[update] Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each month.[8]\nWikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[398][399][400] The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the Civil Marriage Act.[401] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization[402]\u2014though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[403] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.[404] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.[405]\nIn 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.[412] On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\"[413] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.[414]\nOne of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[415]\nIn a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web\" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \"sapere aude\" (lit.'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of \"dare not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television\u2014how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\"[418]\nWikipedia team visiting the Parliament of AsturiasWikipedians meeting after the 2015 Asturias awards ceremony\nWikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.[419] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a \u20ac10,000 (\u00a36,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the \"community\" category.[420]\nIn 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\"[421]\nMany parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.\nComedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on\u2014the reality we just agreed on\".[214] Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion,[426] as well as the 2010 The Onion article \"'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\".[427]\nIn an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.[428] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.[429]\nIn 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.[431]\nThe Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\"[432]\nIn July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.[433] Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.[434]\nOn August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\"[435] The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman.[436]\nIn December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.[437]\nA group of Wikimedians of the Wikimedia DC chapter at the 2013 DC Wikimedia annual meeting standing in front of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica(back left) at the US National Archives\nThe most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.[447][448][449]Nicholas Carr's 2005 essay \"The amorality of Web 2.0\" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote, \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\"[450] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired, wrote in Nature that the \"wisdom of crowds\" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes.[451]\nWikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping \"far more sharply\".[452]Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\"[452]\nSeveral interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[470]\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[471] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[472] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.[473]\n^Meyers, Peter (September 20, 2001). \"Fact-Driven? Collegial?

        "context": "\nThe Anglo-Zanzibar War was a military conflict fought between the United Kingdom and the Zanzibar Sultanate on 27 August 1896. The conflict lasted between 38 and 45 minutes, marking it as the shortest recorded war in history.[3] The immediate cause of the war was the suspicious death of the pro-British SultanHamad bin Thuwaini on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of Sultan Khalid bin Barghash. The British authorities preferred Hamoud bin Mohammed, who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In the agreement of 14 June 1890 instituting a British protectorate over Zanzibar, a candidate for accession to the sultanate should obtain the permission of the British consul,[4] and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a casus belli and sent an ultimatum to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.\nThe ultimatum expired at 09:00 local time on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered two cruisers, three gunboats, 150 marines and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of Rear-Admiral Harry Rawson and the pro-Anglo Zanzibaris were commanded by Brigadier-General Lloyd Mathews of the Zanzibar army (who was also the First Minister of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and machine guns, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari royal yachtHHS Glasgow and two smaller vessels. Some shots were also fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:46.\nThe sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to German East Africa (in the mainland part of present Tanzania). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamoud in power at the head of a puppet government. The war marked the end of the Zanzibar Sultanate as a sovereign state and the start of a period of heavy British influence.\nZanzibar was an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Tanganyika; today it forms part of Tanzania. The main island, Unguja (or Zanzibar Island), had been under the nominal control of the Sultans of Oman since 1698 when they expelled the Portuguese settlers who had claimed it in 1499.[5] Sultan Majid bin Said declared the island independent of Oman in 1858, which was recognised by the United Kingdom, and split the sultanate from that of Oman.[5]Barghash bin Said, the second sultan and Khalid's father, had been forced by British ultimatum and a threat of blockade to abolish the slave trade in June 1873, though it was later discovered that instructions from London would have prohibited aggressive action being taken immediately if that ultimatum had been rejected.[6]\nThe subsequent sultans established their capital and seat of government at Zanzibar Town where a palace complex was built on the sea front. By 1896, this consisted of the palace itself; the Beit al-Hukm, an attached harem; and the Beit al-Ajaib or \"House of Wonders\"\u2014a ceremonial palace said to be the first building in East Africa to be provided with electricity.[7] The complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure.[8] All three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height.[9]\nBritain had recognised Zanzibar's sovereignty and its sultanate in 1886, after a long period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans.[5][10][11] However, Germany was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century.[12] Sultan Khalifah had granted rights to the land of Kenya to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands.[5] Many of the Arab ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which resulted in some unrest.[5] In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate, which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population.[13] One such conflict in Tanga claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.[13]\nSultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General Lloyd Mathews, a former lieutenant of the Royal Navy, to restore order in Tanganyika.[14] The operation was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong.[13] Further conflicts erupted at Bagamoyo, where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at Ketwa, where German officials and their servants were murdered.[14] Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, established a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade.[14] Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 Ali bin Said ascended to the sultanate.[15] Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as First Minister to lead his cabinet. The British were also guaranteed a veto over the future appointment of sultans.[16]\nSultan Ali's successor was Hamad bin Thuwaini, who became sultan in 1893. Hamad maintained a close relationship with the British, but there was dissent among his subjects over the increasing British control over the country, the British-led army and the abolition of the valuable slave trade.[16] In order to control this dissent, the British authorities authorised the sultan to raise a Zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1,000 men, but these troops were soon involved in clashes with the British-led police.[20][21] Complaints about the bodyguards' activities were also received from the European residents in Zanzibar Town.[16]\nSultan Hamad died suddenly at 11:40 EAT (08:40 UTC) on 25 August 1896.[16] His 29-year-old nephew Khalid bin Bargash, who was suspected by some of his assassination,[16] moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali.[16] The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamoud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them. Khalid was warned by the consul and diplomatic agent to Zanzibar, Basil Cave, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions.[21][22] This course of action had proved successful three years earlier when Khalid had tried to claim the sultanate after the death of Ali, and the British consul-general, Rennell Rodd, had persuaded him of the dangers of such an action.[23]\nKhalid ignored Cave's warning, and his forces began mustering in the Palace Square under the command of Captain Saleh of the palace bodyguard. By the end of the day, they numbered 2,800 men armed with rifles and muskets.[22] The majority were civilians, but the force included 700 Zanzibari Askari soldiers who had sided with Khalid.[22][24] The sultan's artillery, which consisted of several Maxim machine guns, a Gatling gun, a 17th-century bronze cannon, and two 12-pounderfield guns, was aimed at the British ships in the harbour.[22][24][25] The 12-pounders had been presented to the sultan by Wilhelm II, the German emperor.[22] The sultan's troops also took possession of the Zanzibari Navy, which consisted of one wooden sloop, the HHS Glasgow, based on the British frigate Glasgow and built as a royal yacht for the sultan in 1878.[26]\nMathews and Cave also began to muster their forces, already commanding 900 Zanzibari askaris under Lieutenant Arthur Edward Harington Raikes of the Wiltshire Regiment who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of brigadier-general.[22] 150 sailors and marines were landed from the Pearl-classprotected cruiserPhilomel and the gunboatThrush, which were anchored in the harbour.[22] The naval contingent, under the command of Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to deal with any rioting caused by the general population.[22][27] A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of Thrush were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection.[22]HMS Sparrow, another gunboat, entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to Thrush.[22]\nSome concerns were raised among the British diplomats as to the reliability of Raikes' askaris, but they proved to be steady and professional troops hardened by military drill and several expeditions to East Africa. They later became the only land troops to be fired upon by the defenders.[1] Raikes' troops were armed with two Maxim guns and a nine pounder cannon, and were stationed at the nearby customs house.[28] The sultan attempted to have the US consul, Richard Dorsey Mohun, recognise his accession, but the messenger was told:\n...as his accession had not been verified by Her Majesty's government, it is impossible to reply.[25]\nCave continued to send messages to Khalid requesting that he stand down his troops, leave the palace and return home, but these were ignored, and Khalid replied that he would proclaim himself sultan at 15:00. Cave stated that this would constitute an act of rebellion and that Khalid's sultanate would not be recognised by the British government.[22] At 14:30, Sultan Hamad was buried, and exactly 30 minutes later a royal salute from the palace guns proclaimed Khalid's succession. Cave could not open hostilities without government approval and telegraphed the following message to the Foreign Office of Lord Salisbury's administration in London:\nAre we authorised in the event of all attempts at a peaceful solution proving useless, to fire on the Palace from the men-of-war?[29]\nMeanwhile, Cave informed all other foreign consuls that all flags were to remain at half mast in honour of the late Hamad. The only one that did not was a large red flag flying from Khalid's palace. Cave also informed the consuls not to recognise Khalid as sultan, to which they agreed.[30]\nAt 10:00 on 26 August, the Archer-class protected cruiser Racoon arrived at Zanzibar Town and was anchored in line with Thrush and Sparrow. At 14:00, the Edgar-class protected cruiser St George, flagship of the Cape of Good Hope and West Africa Station, steamed into the harbour. On board were Rear-AdmiralHarry Rawson, the commander-in-chief, and further British marines and sailors. At around the same time Lord Salisbury's reply arrived authorising Cave and Rawson to use the resources at their disposal to remove Khalid from power.[31] The telegraph read: \"You are authorised to adopt whatever measures you may consider necessary, and will be supported in your action by Her Majesty's Government. Do not, however, attempt to take any action which you are not certain of being able to accomplish successfully.\"[29]\nCave attempted further negotiations with Khalid, but these failed and Rawson sent an ultimatum, requiring him to haul down his flag and leave the palace by 09:00 on 27 August or he would open fire. During the afternoon, all merchant vessels were cleared from the harbour and the British women and children removed to St George and a British-India Steam Navigation Company vessel for their safety. That night, Consul Mohun noted that: \"The silence which hung over Zanzibar was appalling. Usually drums were beating or babies cried but that night there was absolutely not a sound.\"[32]\nAt 08:00 on the morning of 27 August, after a messenger sent by Khalid requested parley from Cave, the consul replied that he would only have salvation if he agreed to the terms of the ultimatum.[8][33] At 08:30 a further messenger from Khalid declared that \"We have no intention of hauling down our flag and we do not believe you would open fire on us\"; Cave replied that \"We do not want to open fire, but unless you do as you are told we shall certainly do so.\"[32] At 08:55, having received no further word from the palace, aboard St George Rawson hoisted the signal \"prepare for action\".[34]\nAt exactly 09:00, General Lloyd Mathews ordered the British ships to commence the bombardment.[29][35] At 09:02 Her Majesty's Ships Racoon, Thrush and Sparrow opened fire at the palace simultaneously. Thrush's first shot immediately dismounted an Arab 12-pounder cannon. Three thousand defenders, servants and slaves were present in the largely wooden palace, and even with barricades of crates, bales and rubber, there were many casualties from the high explosive shells. Despite initial reports that he had been captured and was to be exiled to India, Sultan Khalid escaped from the palace.[8][36] A Reuters news correspondent reported that the sultan had \"fled at the first shot with all the leading Arabs, who left their slaves and followers to carry on the fighting\", but other sources state that he remained in the palace for longer.[8] The shelling ceased at around 09:40, by which time the palace and attached harem had caught fire, the Sultan's artillery had been silenced and his flag cut down.[1]\nDuring the bombardment a small naval engagement occurred when, at 09:05, the obsolete Glasgow fired upon the St George using her armament of 7 nine-pounder guns and a Gatling gun, which had been a present from Queen Victoria to the sultan.[37] The return fire caused Glasgow to sink, though the shallow harbour meant that her masts remained out of the water.[1]Glasgow's crew hoisted a British flag as a token of their surrender, and they were all rescued by British sailors in launches.[1]Thrush also sank two steam launches whose Zanzibari crews shot at her with rifles. Some land fighting occurred when Khalid's men fired on Raikes' askaris, with little effect, as they approached the palace.[1] The fighting ceased with the end of the shelling. The British controlled the town and the palace, and by the afternoon Hamoud bin Muhammed, an Arab favourable to the British, had been installed as sultan with much reduced powers.[38] The British ships and crews had fired around 500 shells, 4,100 machine gun rounds and 1,000 rifle rounds during the engagement.[39]\nApproximately 500 Zanzibari men and women were killed or wounded during the bombardment, most of the dead a result of the fire that engulfed the palace.[1][2] It is unknown how many of these casualties were combatants, but Khalid's gun crews were said to have been \"decimated\".[40] British casualties amounted to one petty officer severely wounded aboard Thrush who later recovered.[1] Although the majority of the Zanzibari townspeople sided with the British, the town's Indian quarter suffered from opportunistic looting, and around twenty inhabitants died in the chaos.[41] To restore order, 150 British Sikh troops were transferred from Mombasa to patrol the streets.[38] Sailors from St George and Philomel were landed to form a fire brigade to contain the fire, which had spread from the palace to the nearby customs sheds.[42] There was some concern about the fire at the customs sheds as they contained a sizeable store of explosives, but no explosion occurred.[40]\nSultan Khalid, Captain Saleh and around forty followers sought refuge in the German consulate following their flight from the palace,[40][43] where they were guarded by ten armed German sailors and marines while Mathews stationed men outside to arrest them if they tried to leave.[44] Despite extradition requests, the German consul, the recently posted Albrecht von Rechenberg, later Governor of German East Africa, refused to surrender Khalid to the British as his country's extradition treaty with Britain specifically excluded political prisoners.[38] Instead, the German consul promised to remove Khalid to German East Africa without him \"setting foot on the soil of Zanzibar\". At 10:00 on 2 October, SMS Seeadler of the Imperial German Navy arrived in port; at high tide, one of Seeadler's boats made it up to the consulate's garden gate, and Khalid stepped directly from consular grounds to a German war vessel and hence was free from arrest.[44] He was transferred from the boat onto Seeadler and was then taken to Dar es Salaam in German East Africa.[45] Khalid was captured by British forces in 1916, during the East African Campaign of World War I, and exiled to Seychelles and Saint Helena before being allowed to return to East Africa, where he died at Mombasa in 1927.[46] The British punished Khalid's supporters by forcing them to pay reparations to cover the cost of shells fired against them and for damages caused by the looting, which amounted to 300,000 rupees.[38]\nSultan Hamoud was loyal to the British and acted as a figurehead for an essentially British-run government, the sultanate only being retained to avoid the costs involved with running Zanzibar directly as a crown colony.[38] Several months after the war, Hamoud, with British prompting, abolished slavery in all its forms.[38] The emancipation of slaves required them to present themselves to a government office and proved a slow process\u2014within ten years only 17,293 slaves had been freed, from an estimated population of 60,000 in 1891.[47]\nThe badly damaged palace complex was completely changed by the war. The harem, lighthouse and palace were demolished as the bombardment had left them unsafe.[41] The palace site became an area of gardens, while a new palace was erected on the site of the harem.[9][48] The House of Wonders was almost undamaged and would later become the main secretariat for the British governing authorities.[40][49] During renovation work on the House of Wonders in 1897, a clocktower was added to its frontage to replace the lighthouse lost to the shelling.[48] The wreck of Glasgow remained in the harbour in front of the palace, where the shallow waters ensured that her masts would remain visible for several years to come; it was eventually broken up for scrap in 1912.[50]\nThe British protagonists were highly regarded by the governments in London and Zanzibar for their actions leading up to and during the war, and many were rewarded with appointments and honours. General Raikes, leader of the askaris, was appointed a First Class (Second Grade) member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar on 24 September 1896, a First Class member of the Zanzibari Order of Hamondieh on 25 August 1897 and later promoted to Commander of the Zanzibar armies.[51][52] General Mathews, the Zanzibari army commander, was appointed a member of the Grand Order of Hamondieh on 25 August 1897 and became First Minister and Treasurer to the Zanzibari government.[52] Basil Cave, the consul, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1897[53] and promoted to consul-general on 9 July 1903.[54] Harry Rawson was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his work in Zanzibar and would later be Governor of New South Wales in Australia.[55] Rawson was also appointed a first class member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar on 8 February 1897 and the Order of Hamondieh on 18 June 1898.[56][57]\nThere were no further rebellions against British influence during the remaining 67 years of the protectorate.[2]\nBritish sailors pose with a captured cannon outside the sultan's palace\nThe palace complex following the bombardment\nThe masts of the sunken Glasgow can be seen in this panorama of Zanzibar Town harbour taken in 1902, looking east. The House of Wonders is the white building with a tower and many balconies in the middle of the photograph; the harem and palace stood to the left. The consulate buildings are to the right.\nThe war, lasting less than three-quarters of an hour, is sometimes considered the shortest in recorded history.[58] Several durations are given by sources, including 38,[1][59] 40[60] and 45[61] minutes, but the 38-minute duration is the most often quoted. The variation is due to confusion over what actually constitutes the start and end of a war. Some sources take the start of the war as the order to open fire at 09:00 and some with the start of actual firing at 09:02. The end of the war is usually put at 09:37, when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 09:45. The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this uncertainty with St George indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, Thrush at 09:40, Racoon at 09:41, and Philomel and Sparrow at 09:45.[62]",

        "context": "\nThe Summer Olympic Games (French: Jeux olympiques d'\u00e9t\u00e9), also known as the Games of the Olympiad, and often referred to as the Summer Olympics, is a major international multi-sport event normally held once every four years. The inaugural Games took place in 1896 in Athens, Greece, and the most recent Games were held in 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for organising the Games and for overseeing the host city's preparations.[1] The tradition of awarding medals began in 1904; in each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals for second place, and bronze medals for third place. The Winter Olympic Games were created out of the success of the Summer Olympic Games, which are regarded as the largest and most prestigious multi-sport international event in the world.\nLondon was the first city to host the Summer Olympic Games three times. As of 2022[update], Paris, Los Angeles, Athens and Tokyo have each hosted twice; Paris will host for the third time in 2024, followed by Los Angeles which will host the Games in 2028.[2] Only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games: Australia, France, Great Britain, Greece, and Switzerland. Australia, France and Great Britain have won at least a medal at every edition of the Games, with Great Britain as the only one to win gold each time. The United States leads the all-time medal count at the Summer Olympics, and has topped the medal table on 18 separate occasions\u2014followed by the USSR (six times), and France, Great Britain, Germany, China, and the ex-Soviet 'Unified Team' (once each).\nIn 2012, Great Britain hosted its third Summer Olympic Games in London, which became the first city ever to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games three times. The cities of Los Angeles, Paris, and Athens (excluding 1906) have each hosted two Summer Olympic Games. In 2024, France will host its third Summer Olympic Games in its capital, making Paris the second city ever to have hosted three Summer Olympics. In 2028, Los Angeles will in turn become the third city ever to have hosted the Games three times.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) was founded in 1894 when Pierre de Coubertin, a French pedagogue and historian, sought to promote international understanding through sporting competition. The first edition of The Olympic Games was held in Athens in 1896 and attracted just 245 competitors, of whom more than 200 were Greek, and only 14 countries were represented. Nevertheless, no international events of this magnitude had been organised before. Female athletes were not allowed to compete, though one woman, Stamata Revithi, ran the marathon course on her own, saying \"If the committee doesn't let me compete I will go after them regardless\".[5]\nThe 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first Olympic Games held in the modern era. About 100,000 people attended for the opening of the games. The athletes came from 14 nations, with most coming from Greece. Although Greece had the most athletes, the U.S. finished with the most champions. 11 Americans placed first in their events vs. the 10 from Greece.[6]Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, consequently Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by Pierre de Coubertin in Paris, on 23 June 1894. The IOC was also established during this congress.\nDespite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. Panathinaiko Stadium, the first big stadium in the modern world, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.[7] The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spiridon Louis, a water carrier. He won in 2 hours, 58 minutes and 50 seconds, setting off wild celebrations at the stadium. The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnastCarl Schuhmann, who won four gold medals.\nGreek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The second Olympics was held in Paris.[8]\nFour years later the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris attracted more than four times as many athletes, including 20 women, who were allowed to officially compete for the first time, in croquet, golf, sailing, and tennis. The Games were integrated with the Paris World's Fair and lasted over five months. It has been disputed which exact events were Olympic, as some events were for professionals, some had restricted eligibility, and others lacked international competitors.\nTensions caused by the Russo\u2013Japanese War and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis may have contributed to the fact that very few top-ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in the 1904 Games.[9]\nThe \"Second International Olympic Games in Athens\", as they were called at the time, were held in 1906.[10] The IOC does not currently recognise these games as being official Olympic Games, although many historians do and credit the 1906 games with preventing the demise of the Olympics. The 1906 Athens games were the first of an alternating series of games to be held in Athens in even non-Olympic years, but the series failed to materialise. The games were more successful than the 1900 and 1904 games, with over 850 athletes competing, and contributed positively to the success of future games.\nThe 1908 London Games saw numbers rise again, as well as the first running of the marathon over its now-standard distance of 42.195 km (26 miles 385 yards). The first Olympic Marathon in 1896 (a male-only race) was raced at a distance of 40 km (24 miles 85 yards). The new marathon distance was chosen to ensure that the race finished in front of the box occupied by the British royal family. Thus the marathon had been 40 km (24.9 mi) for the first games in 1896, but was subsequently varied by up to 2 km (1.2 mi) due to local conditions such as street and stadium layout. At the six Olympic games between 1900 and 1920, the marathon was raced over six distances. The Games saw Great Britain winning 146 medals, 99 more than second-placed Americans, its best result to this day.\nAt the end of the 1908 marathon, the Italian runner Dorando Pietri was first to enter the stadium, but he was clearly in distress and collapsed of exhaustion before he could complete the event. He was helped over the finish line by concerned race officials and later disqualified for that. As compensation for the missing medal, Queen Alexandra gave Pietri a gilded silver cup. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a special report about the race in the Daily Mail.[11]\nThe Games continued to grow, attracting 2,504 competitors, to Stockholm in 1912, including the great all-rounder Jim Thorpe, who won both the decathlon and pentathlon. Thorpe had previously played a few games of baseball for a fee, and saw his medals stripped for this 'breach' of amateurism after complaints from Avery Brundage. They were reinstated in 1983, 30 years after his death. The Games at Stockholm were the first to fulfil Pierre de Coubertin's original idea. For the first time since the Games started in 1896, all five inhabited continents were represented with athletes competing in the same stadium.\nThe 1920 Antwerp Games in war-ravaged Belgium were a subdued affair, but again drew a record number of competitors. This record only stood until 1924, when the Paris Games involved 3,000 competitors, the greatest of whom was Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi. The \"Flying Finn\" won three team gold medals and the individual 1,500 and 5,000 meter runs, the latter two on the same day.[12]\nThe 1928 Amsterdam Games was notable for being the first games which allowed females to compete at track & field athletics, and benefited greatly from the general prosperity of the times alongside the first appearance of sponsorship of the games, from the Coca-Cola Company. The 1928 games saw the introduction of a standard medal design with the IOC choosing Giuseppe Cassioli's depiction of Greek goddess Nike and a winner being carried by a crowd of people. This design was used up until 1972.[citation needed]\nThe 1936 Berlin Games were seen by the German government as a golden opportunity to promote their ideology. The ruling Nazi Party commissioned film-maker Leni Riefenstahl to film the games. The result, Olympia, was widely considered to be a masterpiece, despite Hitler's theories of Aryan racial superiority being repeatedly shown up by \"non-Aryan\" athletes. In particular, African-American sprinter and long jumper Jesse Owens won four gold medals. The 1936 Berlin Games also saw the introduction of the Torch Relay.[13]\nDue to World War II, the 1940 Games (due to be held in Tokyo and temporarily relocated to Helsinki upon the outbreak of war) were cancelled. The 1944 Games were due to be held in London but were also cancelled; instead, London hosted the first games after the end of the war, in 1948.\nThe first post-war Games were held in 1948 in London, with both Germany and Japan excluded.[14] Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen won four gold medals on the track, emulating Owens' achievement in Berlin.[15]\nAt the 1952 Helsinki Games, the USSR team competed for the first time and quickly emerged as one of the dominant teams, finishing second in the number of gold and overall medals won. Their immediate success might be explained by the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\". The USSR entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis, hence violating amateur rules.[16][17][18][19][20] Finland made a legend of an amiable Czechoslovak Army lieutenant named Emil Z\u00e1topek, who was intent on improving on his single gold and silver medals from 1948. Having first won both the 10,000- and 5,000-meter races, he also entered the marathon, despite having never previously raced at that distance. Pacing himself by chatting with the other race leaders, Z\u00e1topek led from about halfway, slowly dropping the remaining contenders to win by two and a half minutes, and completed a trio of wins.[21]\nAt the 1960 Rome Games, a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, arrived on the scene. Ali would later throw his gold medal away in disgust after being refused service in a whites-only restaurant in his home town of Louisville, Kentucky.[23] He was awarded a new medal 36 years later at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.[24] Other notable performers in 1960 included Wilma Rudolph, a gold medallist in the 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay events.[25]\nThe 1964 Tokyo Games were the first to be broadcast worldwide on television, enabled by the recent advent of communication satellites.[26] These Games marked a turning point in the global visibility and popularity of the Olympics and are credited for heralding the modern age of telecommunications. Judo debuted as an official sport, and Dutch judoka Anton Geesink caused a stir when he won the final of the open weight division, defeating Akio Kaminaga in front of his home crowd.[27]\nThe opening ceremony for the 1968 Games, in Mexico City, the first held in Latin America\nPolitics again intervened at the 1972 Games in Munich, but this time with lethal consequences. A Palestinian terrorist group named Black September invaded the Olympic village and broke into the apartment of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held nine others as hostages, demanding that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused the terrorists' demands, the situation developed into a tense stand-off while negotiations continued. Eventually, the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage and taken to an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the ensuing firefight, 15 people were killed, including the nine captive Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists.[32] After much debate, the decision was taken to continue the Games, but the proceedings were understandably dominated by these events.[33] Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer Mark Spitz, Finland's Lasse Vir\u00e9n taking back-to-back gold medals in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, and the winning of three gold medals by Soviet gymnastic star Olga Korbut, who achieved a historic backflip off the high bar.\nThere was no such tragedy at the 1976 Montreal Games, but bad planning and fraud led to the cost of these Games far exceeding the budget. Costing $1.5 billion (equivalent to $6.83 billion in 2021),[34][35] the 1976 Summer Games were the most expensive in Olympic history (until the 2014 Winter Olympics) and it seemed, for a time, that the Olympics might no longer be a viable financial proposition. In retrospect, it is believed that contractors (suspected of being members of the Montreal Mafia) skimmed large sums of money from all levels of contracts while also profiting from the substitution of cheaper building materials of lesser quality, which may have contributed to the delays, poor construction, and excessive costs. In 1988, one such contractor, Giuseppe Zappia \"was cleared of fraud charges that resulted from his work on Olympic facilities after two key witnesses died before testifying at his trial\".[36] The 1976 Games were boycotted by many African nations as a protest against a recent tour of apartheid-run South Africa by the New Zealand national rugby union team.[37] Romanian gymnast Nadia Com\u0103neci made history when she won the women's individual all-around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores. She won two other individual events, with two perfect scores in the balance beam and all perfect scores in the uneven bars.[38] Lasse Vir\u00e9n repeated his double gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters, making him the first athlete to ever win the distance double twice.[39]\nFollowing the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, 66 nations, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Japan, boycotted the 1980 Games held in Moscow. Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games \u2013 the smallest number since 1956. The boycott contributed to the 1980 Games being a less publicised and less competitive affair, which was dominated by the host country.\nIn 1984, the Soviet Union and 13 Soviet allies retaliated by boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Romania and Yugoslavia, notably are the only two countries from the Eastern Bloc that did attend the 1984 Olympics. These games were perhaps the first games of a new era to make a profit. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time.[40] The Games were also the first time mainland China (People's Republic) participated.\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the IOC to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".[41] On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games.\"[41][42]\nDocuments obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the programme, along with suggestions for further enhancements.[43] The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping programme prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.[43]\nThe 1988 Games, in Seoul, was very well planned but the games were tainted when many of the athletes, most notably men's 100 metres winner Ben Johnson, failed mandatory drug tests. Despite splendid drug-free performances by many individuals, the number of people who failed screenings for performance-enhancing chemicals overshadowed the games.\nThe 1992 Barcelona Games featured the admittance of players from one of the North American top leagues, the NBA, exemplified by but not limited to US basketball's \"Dream Team\". The 1992 games also saw the reintroduction to the Games of several smaller European states which had been annexed into the Soviet Union during World War II. At these games, gymnast Vitaly Scherbo set an inaugural medal record of five individual gold medals at a Summer Olympics, and equaled the inaugural record set by Eric Heiden at the 1980 Winter Olympics.\nBy then the process of choosing a location for the Games had become a commercial concern; there were widespread allegations of corruption potentially affecting the IOC's decision process.\nAt the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics, the highlight was 200 meters runner Michael Johnson annihilating the world record in front of a home crowd. Canadians savoured Donovan Bailey's recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when Muhammad Ali, clearly affected by Parkinson's disease, lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for the one he had discarded in 1960. The latter event took place in the basketball arena. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a bomb exploded during the celebration in Centennial Olympic Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, Eric Robert Rudolph, was arrested.\nThe 2000 Summer Olympics, held in Sydney, Australia, showcased individual performances by locals favorites Ian Thorpe in the pool and Cathy Freeman, an Indigenous Australian whose triumph in the 400 meters united a packed stadium., Briton Steve Redgrave who won a rowing gold medal in an unprecedented fifth consecutive Olympics, and Eric \"the Eel\" Moussambani, a swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, received wide media coverage when he completed the 100 meter freestyle swim in by far the slowest time in Olympic history. He nevertheless won the heat as both his opponents had been disqualified for false starts. His female compatriot Paula Barila Bolopa also received media attention for her record-slow and struggling but courageous performance. The Sydney Games also saw the first appearance of a joint North and South Korean contingent at the opening ceremonies, though they competed in all events as different teams. Controversy occurred in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics when the vaulting horse was set to the wrong height during the All-Around Competition.\nIn 2004, the Olympic Games returned to their birthplace in Athens, Greece. At least $7.2 billion was spent on the 2004 Games, including $1.5 billion on security. Michael Phelps won his first Olympic medals, tallying six gold and two bronze medals. Pyrros Dimas, winning a bronze medal, became the most decorated weightlifter of all time with four Olympic medals, three gold and one bronze. Although unfounded reports of potential terrorism drove crowds away from the preliminary competitions at the first weekend of the Olympics (14\u201315 August 2004), attendance picked up as the Games progressed. A third of the tickets failed to sell,[44] but ticket sales still topped figures from the Seoul and Barcelona Olympics (1988 and 1992).[citation needed] IOC President Jacques Rogge characterised Greece's organisation as outstanding and its security precautions as flawless.[45] All 202 NOCs participated at the Athens Games with over 11,000 participants.\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics was held in Beijing, People's Republic of China. Several new events were held, including the new discipline of BMX for both men and women. Women competed in the steeplechase for the first time. The fencing programme was expanded to include all six events for both men and women; previously, women had not been able to compete in team foil or sabre events, although women's team \u00e9p\u00e9e and men's team foil were dropped for these Games. Marathon swimming events were added, over the distance of 10 km (6.2 mi). Also, the doubles events in table tennis were replaced by team events.[46] American swimmer Michael Phelps set a record for gold medals at a single Games with eight, and tied the record of most gold medals by a single competitor previously held by both Eric Heiden and Vitaly Scherbo. Another notable star of the Games was Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who became the first male athlete ever to set world records in the finals of both the 100 and 200 metres in the same Games. Equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.\nLondon held the 2012 Summer Olympics, becoming the first city to host the Olympic Games three times. In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"Happy and glorious\". The host nation won 29 gold medals, the best haul for Great Britain since the 1908 Games in London. The United States returned to the top of the medal table after China dominated in 2008. The IOC had removed baseball and softball from the 2012 programme. The London Games were successful on a commercial level because they were the first in history to completely sell out every ticket, with as many as 1 million applications for 40,000 tickets for both the Opening Ceremony and the 100m Men's Sprint Final. Such was the demand for tickets to all levels of each event that there was controversy over seats being set aside for sponsors and National Delegations which went unused in the early days. A system of reallocation was put in place so the empty seats were filled throughout the Games.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympics were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. The city was the fifth in history to host the Games twice and the first Asian city to have this title. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the IOC and the Tokyo Organising Committee announced that the 2020 Games were to be delayed until 2021, marking the first time that the Olympic Games have been postponed. Unlike previous Olympics, these Games took place without spectators due to concerns over COVID-19 and a state of emergency imposed in the host city.[48][49][50] Nevertheless, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games featured many memorable moments and feats of technical excellence. One star of the games, the US gymnast Simone Biles, gracefully bowed out to focus on her mental health, but later returned to claim an individual bronze medal.[51] Norway's Karsten Warholm smashed his own world record in the 400m hurdles.[52]\nThere has been a total of 42 sports, spanning 55 disciplines, included in the Olympic programme at one point or another in the history of the Games. The schedule has comprised 33 sports for recent Summer Olympics (2020), with 32 sports planned for the next Summer Olympics (2024).\nFor individual sports, competitors typically qualify by attaining a certain place in a major international event or on the IF's ranking list. There is a general rule that a maximum of three individual athletes may represent each nation per competition. National Olympic Committees (NOCs) may enter a limited number of qualified competitors in each event, and the NOC decides which qualified competitors to select as representatives in each event if more have attained the benchmark than can be entered.[54]\nNations most often qualify teams for team sports through continental qualifying tournaments, in which each continental association is given a certain number of spots in the Olympic tournament. Each nation may be represented by no more than one team per competition; a team consists of just two people in some sports.\nThe IOC divides Summer Olympic sports into five categories (A \u2013 E) based on popularity, gauged by six criteria: television viewing figures (40%), internet popularity (20%), public surveys (15%), ticket requests (10%), press coverage (10%), and number of national federations (5%). The category of a sport determines the share of Olympic revenue received by that sport's International Federation.[55][56] Sports that were new to the 2016 Olympics (rugby and golf) have been placed in Category E.\nThe IOC has never decided which events of the early Games were \"Olympic\" and which were not.[57] The founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Coubertin, ceded that determination to the organisers of those Games.\nA.123 The IOC site for the 1896, 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympic Games does not include Mixed teams (teams of athletes from different nations) as separate \"nation\" when counting participating nations. At the same time the IOC shows Mixed team in the results of competitions where these teams competed. Thus, specified number of national teams plus Mixed teams participated in the Games.\nB.^ At an earlier time the IOC database for the 1900 Summer Olympics listed 85 medal events, 24 participating countries and 997 athletes (22 women, 975 men).[87] The Olympic historian and author, Bill Mallon,[88] whose studies have shed light on the topic, suggested the number 95 events satisfying all four retrospective selection criteria (restricted to amateurs, international participation, open to all competitors and without handicapping) and now should be considered as Olympic events. In July 2021, the IOC upgraded its complete online database of all Olympic results explicitly to incorporate the data of the Olympic historians website, Olympedia.org, thus accepting Mallon's recommendation (based on four applied criteria) for events of the 1900 Olympic Games. The eleven events, the results of which had nevertheless been shown within the earlier IOC database, have been added over the former total of 85. \u041ene shooting event (20 metre military pistol, which was an event for professionals) have been removed. Acceptance of Mallon's recommendation increased the number of events to 95, and also entailed increasing the number of participation countries up to 26 and athletes up to 1226. After upgrading of the IOC online database the IOC web site results section contains 95 events.[89] The IOC webpage for the 1900 Summer Olympics shows a total of 95 medal events, 26 participating countries and 1226 athletes.[59] Furthermore, the IOC factsheet \"The Games of the Olympiad\" of November 2021 refers to 95 events, but still refers to old numbers of participating countries (24) and athletes (997).[9]\nC.^ According to the International Olympic Committee, 26 nations sent competitors to this edition.[59] The concept of \"national teams\" chosen by National Olympic Committees did not exist at this point in time. When counting the number of participating countries in the early Olympic Games, the IOC does not take into account otherwise unrepresented countries whose citizens competed for other countries. Modern research shows[88] that at the 1900 Olympics, the athletes of at least four otherwise unrepresented countries (Canada, Luxembourg, Colombia, New Zealand) competed for other countries in both individual and team sports. The IOC website lists all of them in the results section under their nationalities,[89] but does not include their countries among the 26 participating countries.[59]\nD.^ The IOC webpage for the 1904 Summer Olympics[60] sets the number at 95 events, while at one time the IOC webpage[90] listed 91. The figure of 91 is sourced to a work by Olympic historian and author, Bill Mallon,[91] whose studies have shed light on the topic. Events satisfying all four of these retrospective selection criteria of the early 20th century \u2014 restricted to amateurs, allowing international participation, open to all competitors and without handicapping \u2014 are now regarded as Olympic events.\nE.123 Although the Games of 1916, 1940, and 1944 were cancelled, the Roman numerals for those Games were still applied because the official titles of the Summer Games count the Olympiads, not the Games themselves, per the Olympic Charter.[92] This contrasts with the Winter Olympics, which ignore the cancelled Winter Games of 1940 and 1944 in their numeric count.\nF.^ The IOC webpage for the 1920 Summer Olympics[64] gives the figure of 156 events, while at one time the IOC webpage[93] listed 154 (difference was two sailing events in Amsterdam).\nI.^ Owing to Australian quarantine laws, six equestrian events were held in Stockholm for the 1956 Summer Olympics several months before the other events in Melbourne; five of the 72 nations that competed in the equestrian events in Stockholm did not attend the main Games in Melbourne.\nJ.^ The 1972 Summer Olympics was originally scheduled to end on 10 September 1972, but was postponed to a day on 11 September after events had been suspended for 34 hours due to the Munich massacre, which happened after day 9.\nK.^ IOC records state Brezhnev opened the Moscow Games as \"President\", a title used at that time by the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, or de jure head of state. (The office of President of the Soviet Union was not created until 1990, a year before the nation broke up.)[94]\nL.^ Originally scheduled for 24 July \u2013 9 August 2020, the Games were postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the event was still referred to as the 2020 Summer Olympics (marking the 32nd Olympiad) to preserve the four-year Olympiad cycle.[48]\nM.^ Number of athletes will be in limited quota into an equal number of gender participants.[95]\n^Lennartz, Karl; Teutenberg, Walter (1995). Olympische Spiele 1900 in Paris. Kassel, Germany: Agon-Sportverlag. p. 147. ISBN3-928562-20-7. In many works, it is read that the IOC later met to decide which events were Olympic and which were not. This is not correct and no decision has ever been made. No discussion of this item can be found in the account of any Session.",

Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown entity under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Use of bitcoin as a currency began in 2009, when its implementation was released as open-source software.\nThe Library of Congress reports that, as of November 2021, nine countries have banned bitcoin use, and a further forty-two have implicitly banned it. In contrast, a few governments have used bitcoin in some capacity. For example, El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, although use by merchants remains low. Ukraine has accepted cryptocurrency donations to fund the resistance to the 2022 Russian invasion, and Iran has used bitcoin to bypass political sanctions.\nBitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.\nThe environmental effects of bitcoin are substantial. Wikipedia\nAbout United States Dollar\n\ue316\ue313\nThe United States dollar is the official currency of the United States and several other countries. The Coinage Act of 1792 introduced the U.S. dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar, divided it into 100 cents, and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents. U.S. banknotes are issued in the form of Federal Reserve Notes, popularly called greenbacks due to their predominantly green color.\nThe monetary policy of the United States is conducted by the Federal Reserve System, which acts as the nation's central bank.\nThe U.S. dollar was originally defined under a bimetallic standard of 371.25 grains fine silver or, from 1837, 23.22 grains fine gold, or $20.67 per troy ounce. The Gold Standard Act of 1900 linked the dollar solely to gold. From 1934, its equivalence to gold was revised to $35 per troy ounce. Since 1971, all links to gold have been repealed.\nThe U.S. dollar became an important international reserve currency after the First World War, and displaced the pound sterling as the world's primary reserve currency by the Bretton Woods Agreement towards the end of the Second World War.

        "context": "\nA food allergy is an abnormal immune response to food. The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as anaphylaxis.[1] A food intolerance and food poisoning are separate conditions, not due to an immune response.[1][4]\nEarly exposure to potential allergens may be protective.[2][3] Management primarily involves avoiding the food in question and having a plan if exposure occurs.[2] This plan may include giving adrenaline (epinephrine) and wearing medical alert jewelry.[1] The benefits of allergen immunotherapy for food allergies is unclear, thus is not recommended as of 2015[update].[7] Some types of food allergies among children resolve with age, including those to milk, eggs, and soy; while others such as to nuts and shellfish typically do not.[2]\nIn the developed world, about 4% to 8% of people have at least one food allergy.[1][2] They are more common in children than adults and appear to be increasing in frequency.[2] Male children appear to be more commonly affected than females.[2] Some allergies more commonly develop early in life, while others typically develop in later life.[1] In developed countries, more people believe they have food allergies when they actually do not have them.[8][9][10]\nIn some cases, however, onset of symptoms may be delayed for hours.[11]\nSymptoms can vary. The amount of food needed to trigger a reaction also varies.[12]\nSerious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated through wheezing and cyanosis. Poor blood circulation leads to a weak pulse, pale skin and fainting.[13]\nA severe case of an allergic reaction, caused by symptoms affecting the respiratory tract and blood circulation, is called anaphylaxis. When symptoms are related to a drop in blood pressure, the person is said to be in anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show symptoms.[14] Those with asthma or an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or seafood are at greater risk for anaphylaxis.\nAllergic reactions are abnormal immune responses that develop after exposure to a given food allergen.[15] Food allergens account for about 90% of all allergic reactions.[16] The most common food allergens include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat,[17] which are referred to as \"the big eight\".[18] In April of 2021, President Joe Biden signed the FASTER Act into law. This landmark food allergy law recognizes sesame as the ninth mandatory food label allergen. It also encourages research that will improve the quality of life for food allergy families, and that could potentially lower the rates of future food allergies.[19][20]\nPeanuts, a member of the legume family, are one of the most common food allergens that induce reactions in both children and adults.[21] Affecting about 2% of the Western population, peanut allergies tend to cause more severe reactions and anaphylaxis than other food allergies.[22] Tree nuts, including almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts, are also common allergens. Affected individuals may be sensitive to one particular tree nut or many different ones.[23] Peanuts and seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, can be processed to extract oils, but trace amounts of protein may also elicit an allergic reaction.[23] Peanut and tree nut allergies are lifelong conditions for the majority of those affected, although evidence shows that ~20% of those with peanut allergies and 9% of those with tree nut allergies may outgrow them.[24]\nEgg allergies affect about one in 50 children but are frequently outgrown when children reach age five.[25] Affected individuals can be sensitive to proteins both in the egg white and egg yolk, but most children are allergic to those in the white while most adults are allergic to those in the yolk.[26]\nCow's milk is the most common food allergen in infants and young children, yet many adults are also sensitized to cow's milk.[27] Many affected individuals cannot tolerate dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.[28] A small portion of children with milk allergy, roughly 10%, have a reaction to beef because it contains small amounts of protein that are also present in cow's milk.[29]\nShellfish, which are divided into crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and mollusks (mussel, oyster, scallop, squid, octopus, snail, etc.), are the most common food allergy in adults.[30] People may be allergic to other types of seafood, such as fish.[31] Fish allergies were found to be more common in countries that have high fish consumption compared to those with lower consumption.[32]\nOther common food allergens include soy and wheat.[33] Those allergic to wheat may be sensitized to any protein in the wheat kernel.[34] To a lesser frequency, people may be mildly allergic to raw fruits and vegetables, a disease known as oral allergy syndrome.[33] Less common allergens include maize, spices, synthetic and natural colors,[35] and chemical additives.[36]\nBalsam of Peru, which is in various foods, is in the \"top five\" allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics.[37]\nExposure to certain food proteins triggers the production of antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which, if unaccompanied by allergic symptoms, is known as allergic sensitization.[38] Oral ingestion is the main sensitization route for most food allergy cases, yet other routes of exposure include inhalation and skin contact.[39][34]\nFor example, inhaling airborne particles in a farm-scale or factory-scale peanut shelling/crushing environment, or from cooking, can induce respiratory effects in allergic individuals.[40] Furthermore, peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants,[41] suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization.[42][43] An estimated 28.5 million people worldwide are engaged in the seafood industry, which includes fishing, aquaculture, processing and industrial cooking.[44] In these occupational settings, individuals with fish and shellfish allergies are at high risk of exposure to allergenic proteins via aerosolization.[45][44] Respiratory symptoms may be induced by inhalation of wet aerosols from fresh fish handling, inhalation of dry aerosols from fishmeal processing, and dermal contact through skin breaks and cuts.[46][44] Another occupational food allergy that involves respiratory symptoms is \"baker's asthma,\" which commonly develops in food service workers who work with baked goods.[47] Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat, some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens.[48]\nAllergic sensitization can occur via skin antigen exposure, which usually manifests as hives.[49] The skin has been suggested to be a critical sensitization route for peanut-allergic individuals.[50][40] Peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants,[41] reinforcing that those with disrupted epithelial barriers, notably the skin barrier, are more prone to skin sensitization.[42] Environmental factors, such as exposure to food, microorganisms, creams, and detergents, may lead to skin barrier dysfunction.[51] Several studies reveal that children exposed to skin creams containing peanut oil are reported to have a higher risk of peanut allergy,[51] suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization.[42][43]\nSome children who are allergic to cow's milk protein also show a cross-sensitivity to soy-based products.[53] Some infant formulas have their milk and soy proteins hydrolyzed, so when taken by infants, their immune systems do not recognize the allergen and they can safely consume the product. Hypoallergenic infant formulas can be based on proteins partially predigested to a less antigenic form. Other formulas, based on free amino acids, are the least antigenic and provide complete nutritional support in severe forms of milk allergy. [54]\nHistamine, the structure shown, causes a person to feel itchy during an allergic reaction.\nConditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response:[57]\nIgE-mediated (classic) \u2013 the most common type, occurs shortly after eating and may involve anaphylaxis.\nNon-IgE mediated \u2013 characterized by an immune response not involving immunoglobulin E; may occur some hours after eating, complicating diagnosis\nIgE and/or non-IgE-mediated \u2013 a hybrid of the above two types\nAllergic reactions are abnormal immune responses to certain substances that are normally harmless. When immune cells encounter the allergenic protein, IgE antibodies are produced; this is similar to the immune system's reaction to foreign pathogens. The IgE antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction. The harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein. IgE antibodies bind to a receptor on the surface of the protein, creating a tag, just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged. Why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do is not entirely clear.[58]\nHypersensitivities are categorized according to the parts of the immune system that are attacked and the amount of time it takes for the response to occur. The four types of hypersensitivity reaction are: type 1, immediate IgE-mediated; type 2, cytotoxic; type 3, immune complex-mediated; and type 4, delayed cell-mediated.[59] The pathophysiology of allergic responses can be divided into two phases. The first is an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen. This phase can either subside or progress into a \"late-phase reaction\" which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in tissue damage.[citation needed]\nMany food allergies are caused by hypersensitivities to particular proteins in different foods. Proteins have unique properties that allow them to become allergens, such as stabilizing forces in their tertiary and quaternary structures which prevent degradation during digestion. Many theoretically allergenic proteins cannot survive the destructive environment of the digestive tract, thus do not trigger hypersensitive reactions.[60]\nIn the early stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen, encountered for the first time, causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, which belongs to a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is the production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called Fc\u03b5RI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.[61]\nIf later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth-muscle contraction. This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, the allergen, and the mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems.[61]\nAfter the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2\u201324 hours after the original reaction.[62] Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects.[63]\nFor skin-prick tests, a tiny board with protruding needles is used. The allergens are placed either on the board or directly on the skin. The board is then placed on the skin, to puncture the skin and for the allergens to enter the body. If a hive appears, the person is considered positive for the allergy. This test only works for IgE antibodies. Allergic reactions caused by other antibodies cannot be detected through skin-prick tests.[64]\nSkin-prick testing is easy to do and results are available in minutes. Different allergists may use different devices for testing. Some use a \"bifurcated needle\", which looks like a fork with two prongs. Others use a \"multitest\", which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it. In these tests, a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a testing device, and the device is placed on the skin to prick, or break through, the top layer of skin. This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin. A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic. This test generally yields a positive or negative result. It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not because it detects IgE. Skin tests cannot predict if a reaction would occur or what kind of reaction might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen. They can, however, confirm an allergy in light of a patient's history of reactions to a particular food. Non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.\nPatch testing is used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed food reactions.[65][66][67]\nBlood testing is another way to test for allergies; however, it poses the same disadvantage and only detects IgE allergens and does not work for every possible allergen. Radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) is used to detect IgE antibodies present to a certain allergen. The score taken from the RAST is compared to predictive values, taken from a specific type of RAST. If the score is higher than the predictive values, a great chance the allergy is present in the person exists. One advantage of this test is that it can test many allergens at one time.[68]\nA CAP-RAST has greater specificity than RAST; it can show the amount of IgE present to each allergen.[69] Researchers have been able to determine \"predictive values\" for certain foods, which can be compared to the RAST results. If a person's RAST score is higher than the predictive value for that food, over a 95% chance exists that patients will have an allergic reaction (limited to rash and anaphylaxis reactions) if they ingest that food.[citation needed] Currently,[when?] predictive values are available for milk, egg, peanut, fish, soy, and wheat.[70][71][72] Blood tests allow for hundreds of allergens to be screened from a single sample, and cover food allergies as well as inhalants. However, non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method. Other widely promoted tests such as the antigen leukocyte cellular antibody test and the food allergy profile are considered unproven methods, the use of which is not advised.[73]\nFood challenges test for allergens other than those caused by IgE allergens. The allergen is given to the person in the form of a pill, so the person can ingest the allergen directly. The person is watched for signs and symptoms. The problem with food challenges is that they must be performed in the hospital under careful watch, due to the possibility of anaphylaxis.[74]\nFood challenges, especially double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, are the gold standard for diagnosis of food allergies, including most non-IgE-mediated reactions, but is rarely done.[75] Blind food challenges involve packaging the suspected allergen into a capsule, giving it to the patient, and observing the patient for signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.[medical citation needed]\nThe recommended method for diagnosing food allergy is to be assessed by an allergist. The allergist will review the patient's history and the symptoms or reactions that have been noted after food ingestion. If the allergist feels the symptoms or reactions are consistent with food allergy, he/she will perform allergy tests. Additional diagnostic tools for evaluation of eosinophilic or non-IgE mediated reactions include endoscopy, colonoscopy, and biopsy.[medical citation needed]\nLactose intolerance generally develops later in life, but can present in young patients in severe cases. It is not an immune reaction and is due to an enzyme deficiency (lactase). It is more common in many non-Western people.\nBreastfeeding for more than four months may prevent atopic dermatitis, cow's milk allergy, and wheezing in early childhood.[79] Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective.[2] Specifically, early exposure to eggs and peanuts reduces the risk of allergies to these.[3] Guidelines suggest introducing peanuts as early as 4\u20136 months and include precautionary measures for high-risk infants.[80] The former guidelines, advising delaying the introduction of peanuts, are now[when?] thought to have contributed to the increase in peanut allergy seen recently.[81][better source needed]\nTo avoid an allergic reaction, a strict diet can be followed. It is difficult to determine the amount of allergenic food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted. In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens through skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, blood transfusions, cosmetics, and alcohol.[82]\nEarly introduction of peanut and egg alongside other solids, or by one year of age, may help prevent development of food allergy. Introduction of these allergenic foods within the first year of life appears to be safe. A window of opportunity for the introduction of different food allergens may exist, such as egg introduction ahead of peanut.[83]\nAllergic reactions to airborne particles or vapors of known food allergens have been reported as an occupational consequence of people working in the food industry, but can also take place in home situations, restaurants, or confined spaces such as airplanes. According to two reviews, respiratory symptoms are common, but in some cases there has been progression to anaphylaxis.[84][85] The most frequent reported cases of reactions by inhalation of allergenic foods were due to peanut, seafood, legumes, tree nut, and cow's milk.[84] Steam rising from cooking of lentils, green beans, chickpeas and fish has been well documented as triggering reactions, including anaphylactic reactions.[84][86] One review mentioned case study examples of allergic responses to inhalation of other foods, including examples in which oral consumption of the food is tolerated.[84]\nThe mainstay of treatment for food allergy is total avoidance of the foods identified as allergens. An allergen can enter the body by consuming a portion of food containing the allergen, and can also be ingested by touching any surfaces that may have come into contact with the allergen, then touching the eyes or nose. For people who are extremely sensitive, avoidance includes avoiding touching or inhaling problematic food. Total avoidance is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see regulation of labelling).\nIf the food is accidentally ingested and a systemic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs, then epinephrine should be used. A second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions. The person should then be transported to the emergency room, where additional treatment can be given. Other treatments include antihistamines and steroids.[87]\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). If administered in a timely manner, epinephrine can reverse its effects. Epinephrine relieves airway swelling and obstruction, and improves blood circulation; blood vessels are tightened and heart rate is increased, improving circulation to body organs. Epinephrine is available by prescription in an autoinjector.[88]\nAntihistamines can alleviate some of the milder symptoms of an allergic reaction, but do not treat all symptoms of anaphylaxis.[89] Antihistamines block the action of histamine, which causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky to plasma proteins. Histamine also causes itchiness by acting on sensory nerve terminals. The most common antihistamine given for food allergies is diphenhydramine.\nGlucocorticoid steroids are used to calm down the immune system cells that are attacked by the chemicals released during an allergic reaction. This treatment in the form of a nasal spray should not be used to treat anaphylaxis, for it only relieves symptoms in the area in which the steroid is in contact. Another reason steroids should not be used is the delay in reducing inflammation. Steroids can also be taken orally or through injection, by which every part of the body can be reached and treated, but a long time is usually needed for these to take effect.[90]\nFood allergies affect up to 10% of the worldwide population, and they are currently more prevalent in children (~8%) than adults (~5) in western nations.[34] In several industrialized countries, food allergies affect up to 10% of children.[91] Children are most commonly allergic to cow's milk, chicken eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts.[21] While studies on adults with food allergy are not as abundant, surveys suggest that the most common food allergens for adults include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts.[91]\nFood allergies have become increasingly prevalent in industrialized/westernized nations over the last 2-3 decades.[92] An estimated 15 million people currently have food allergies in the United States.[93] In 1997, 0.4% children in the United States were reported to have peanut allergy, yet this number markedly rose to 1.4% in 2008.[94] In Australia, hospital admission rates for food-induced anaphylaxis increased by an average of 13.2% from 1994-2005.[91] One possible explanation for the rise in food allergy is the \"old friends\" hypothesis, which suggests that non disease causing organisms, such as helminths, could protect against allergy. Therefore, reduced exposure to these organisms, particularly in developed countries, could have contributed towards the increase.[citation needed]\nChildren of East Asian or African descent who live in westernized countries were reported to be at significantly higher risk of food allergy compared to Caucasian children.[15] Several studies predict that Asia and Africa may experience a growth in food allergy prevalence as the lifestyles there become more westernized.[91]\nThe prevalence of certain food allergies is suggested to depend partly on the geographical area and country. For instance, allergy to buckwheat flour, used for soba noodles, is more common in Japan than peanuts, tree nuts or foods made from soy beans.[95] Also, shellfish allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in adults and adolescents particularly in East Asian countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand.[91] Individuals in East Asia have further developed an allergy to rice, which forms a large part of their diet.[96] Another example is that, out of 9 European countries, egg allergy was found[by whom?] to be most prevalent in the UK and least prevalent in Greece.[citation needed]\nAbout 75% of children who have allergies to milk protein are able to tolerate baked-in milk products, i.e., muffins, cookies, cake, and hydrolyzed formulas.[97] About 50% of children with allergies to milk, egg, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, and wheat will outgrow their allergy by the age of 6. Those who are still allergic by the age of 12 or so have less than an 8% chance of outgrowing the allergy.[98]\nIn the United States, food allergy affects as many as 5% of infants less than three years of age[99] and 3% to 4% of adults.[100][101] The prevalence of food allergies is rising.[102][103][104] Food allergies cause roughly 30,000 emergency room visits and 150 deaths per year.[105]\nWhether rates of food allergy are increasing or not, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their caregivers.[106][107][108][109] In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. The Culinary Institute of America, a premier school for chef training, has courses in allergen-free cooking and a separate teaching kitchen.[110] School systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into the school. Despite all these precautions, people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can easily occur at other peoples' houses, at school or in restaurants.[111]\nIn response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain priority allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods.\nThere are no labeling laws mandating declaration of the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross-contamination, except in Brazil.[118][119][120][121][122][123][124][125]\nIn the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains any of these eight major food allergens, added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat.[119] The eight-ingredient is list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission.[124] To meet labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its \"food sourced name\" in parentheses, for example, \"Casein (milk),\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \"Contains milk\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling).[119][121] The European Union requires listing for those eight major allergens plus molluscs, celery, mustard, lupin, sesame and sulfites.[120]\nIn 2018, the US FDA issued a request for information for the consideration of labeling for sesame to help protect people who have sesame allergies.[126] A decision was reached in November 2020 that food manufacturers voluntarily declare that when powdered sesame seeds are used as a previously unspecified spice or flavor, the label be changed to \"spice (sesame)\" or \"flavor (sesame).\"[127]\nCongress and the President passed a law in April 2021, the \"FASTER Act\", stipulating that labeling be mandatory, to be effect January 1, 2023, making it the ninth required food ingredient label.[128]\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 applies to packaged foods regulated by the FDA, which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages.[125] However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like \"Contains: milk\", are mandatory.[122][123] The act also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants.[129][130] The EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 \u2013 requires food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, for example, in catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars.[131]\nIn the United States, there is no federal mandate to address the presence of allergens in drug products, medicines, or cosmetics.[132]\nThe value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross-contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.).[124][125] Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated.[133][134]\nLabeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling, also known as \"may contain\" statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production.[124][135] Precautionary allergen labeling can be confusing to consumers, especially as there can be many variations on the wording of the warning.[135][136] Precautionary allergen labeling is optional in the United States.[137] As of 2014[update], precautionary allergen labeling is regulated only in Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010 and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. South Africa does not permit the use of precautionary allergen labeling, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment and despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice.[124] In Australia and New Zealand there is a recommendation that precautionary allergen labeling be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling). A review identified \"the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population\" as the threshold reference dose for certain foods (such as cow's milk, egg, peanut and other proteins) to provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labeling and give consumers a better idea of what might be accidentally in a food product beyond \"may contain.\"[138][139] VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry sponsored, non-government organization.[140] The European Union has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but is not expected to publish such before 2024.[141]\nIn Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. These allergens include wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybrids, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybean, milk of all species of mammalians, almonds, hazelnuts, cashew nuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecan nuts, pistachios, pine nuts, and chestnuts.[118]\nAlthough there is a scientific consensus that available food derived from genetically modified crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food,[142][143][144] and a 2016 U.S. National Academy of Sciences report concluded that there is no relationship between consumption of genetically modified foods and the increase in prevalence of food allergies,[145] there are concerns that genetically modified foods, also described as foods sourced from genetically modified organisms, could be responsible for allergic reactions, and that the widespread acceptance of these types of foods may be responsible for what is a real or perceived increase in the percentage of people with allergies.[146][145][147]\nOne concern is that genetic engineering could make an allergy-provoking food more allergic, meaning that smaller portions would suffice to set off a reaction.[147] Of the food currently[when?] in widespread use of genetically modified organisms, only soybeans are identified as a common allergen. However, for the soybean proteins known to trigger allergic reactions, there is more variation from strain to strain than between those and the genetically modified varieties.[145] Another concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[146]\nPrior to a new genetically modified food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?[145] Genes approved for animal use can be restricted from human consumption due to potential for allergic reactions. In 1998 Starlink brand corn restricted to animals was detected in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall.[148] There are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing genetically modified ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (similar to the requirements in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[146]\nIn the US, the FDA Food Code states that the person in charge in restaurants should have knowledge about major food allergens, cross-contacts, and symptoms of food allergy\nreactions. Restaurant staff, including wait staff and kitchen staff, may not be adequately informed about allergenic ingredients, or the risk of cross-contact when kitchen utensils used to prepare food may have been in previous contact with an allergenic food. The problem may be compounded when customers have a hard time describing their food allergies or when wait staff have a hard time understanding those with food allergies when taking an order.[149]\nThere exists both over-reporting and under-reporting of the prevalence of food allergies. Self-diagnosed perceptions of food allergy are greater than the rates of true food allergy because people confuse non-allergic intolerance with allergy, and also attribute non-allergy symptoms to an allergic response. Conversely, healthcare professionals treating allergic reactions on an out-patient or even hospitalized basis may not report all cases. Recent increases in reported cases may reflect a real change in incidence or an increased awareness on the part of healthcare professionals.[150]\nFood fear has a significant impact on quality of life.[108][109] For children with allergies, their quality of life is also affected by the actions of their peers. An increased occurrence of bullying has been observed, which can include threats or deliberate acts of forcing allergic children to contact foods that they must avoid or intentional contamination of allergen-free food.[151] The social impacts of food allergies can carry over into adulthood.[152]\nMedia portrayals of food allergy in television and film are not accurate, often used for comedic effect or underplaying the potential severity of an allergic reaction.[153] These tropes misinform the public and also contribute to how entertainment media will continue to wrongly portray food allergies in the future. Types of tropes: 1) characters have food allergies, providing a weakness that can be used to sabotage them. In the movie Parasite a housekeeper is displaced by taking advantage of her peach allergy.[154] In the animated film Peter Rabbit, the farm owner is attacked by being pelted with blackberries, causing an anaphylactic reaction requiring emergency treatment with epinephrine. After many public protests, Sony Pictures and the Peter Rabbit director apologized for making light of food allergies.[155] 2) Food allergy is used for comedic effect, such as in the movies Hitch and in television, Kelso's egg allergy in That '70s Show 3) Food allergies may be incorporated into characters who are also portrayed as annoying, weak and oversensitive, which can be taken as implying that their allergies are either not real or not potentially severe. In season 1, episode 16 of The Big Bang Theory Howard Wolowitz deliberately consumes a peanut-containing food bar (and has a serious reaction) just to delay Leonard from returning to his apartment where a surprise birthday party is being arranged. 4) Any of these portrayals may underplay the potential severity of food allergy, some showing that Benadryl treatment is sufficient.[154] Viewing of humorous portrayals of food allergies has been shown to have a negative effect on related health policy support due to low perceived seriousness.[153]\nSeveral theories have been suggested to explain why certain individuals develop allergic sensitization instead of oral tolerance to food allergens. One such theory is the dual allergen hypothesis, which states that ingesting food allergens early on promotes oral tolerance while skin exposure leads to sensitization.[93] Instead of oral ingestion, skin barrier disruption in conditions like eczema, for instance, was suggested to cause allergic sensitization in animal and human infants.[49] Inhalation was recently proposed to be an additional sensitization route in the dual allergen hypothesis.[43] Another theory is the barrier regulation hypothesis, describing the role of commensal bacteria in preventing the development of food allergy by maintaining integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier.[93] Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as early life nutrition and antibiotic treatment, may contribute to food allergy prevalence by affecting gut microbial composition, and thus, intestinal immune homeostasis in infants and young children.[156]\nThere is research on the effects of increasing intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy, lactation, via infant formula and in early childhood on the subsequent risk of developing food allergies during infancy and childhood. From two reviews, maternal intake of omega-3, long-chain fatty acids during pregnancy appeared to reduce the risks of medically diagnosed IgE-mediated allergy, eczema and food allergy per parental reporting in the first 12 months of life,[158][159] but the effects were not all sustained past 12 months.[159] The reviews characterized the literature's evidence as inconsistent and limited.[158][159] Results when breastfeeding mothers were consuming a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids were inconclusive.[160] For infants, supplementing their diet with oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids did not affect the risks of food allergies, eczema or asthma either as infants or into childhood.[161]\nThere is research on probiotics, prebiotics and the combination of the two (synbiotics) as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies. From reviews, there appears to be a treatment benefit for eczema,[162][163][164] but not asthma, wheezing or rhinoconjunctivitis.[165] The evidence was not consistent for preventing food allergies and this approach cannot yet be recommended.[163][164][166][167]\nThe Food Standards Agency, in the United Kingdom, are in charge of funding research into food allergies and intolerance.[150] Since their founding in 1994 they have funded over 45 studies.[150] In 2005 Europe created EuroPrevall, a multi-country project dedicated to research involving allergies.[150]",

        "context": "\nX Corp. is an American technology company established by Elon Musk in 2023 as the successor to Twitter, Inc. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings Corp., which is itself owned by Musk. The company owns the social networking service X (formerly Twitter) and has announced plans to use it as a base for other offerings.[4][5]\nIn April 2022, filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed Musk had formed three corporate entities in Delaware, all under the name of X Holdings. According to the filings, one of the entities was to merge with Twitter, Inc., while another was to serve as the parent company of the newly merged company. A third entity would then help take on a US$13 billion loan provided by various large banks to acquire Twitter.[6]\nThe name \"X\" dates back to X.com, an online bank co-founded by Musk in 1999. In March 2000, X.com merged with competitor Confinity to create PayPal.[7] Musk considered forming a holding company named \"X\" for Tesla, Inc. and SpaceX in August 2012.[8] In July 2017, Musk reacquired the domain X.com, for an undisclosed amount, from PayPal.[9] Musk reaffirmed his support for the name \"X\" in December 2020, replying to a Twitter user who renewed calls for Musk to form a new holding company under that name, although he dismissed the idea of X acquiring his businesses.[10]\nThe concept for X solidified in October 2022, when Musk tweeted that acquiring Twitter is \"an accelerant to creating X, the everything app\". According to Musk, Twitter would accelerate the creation of X by \"3 to 5 years\". Musk expressed interest in creating an app similar to WeChat\u2014a Chinese instant messaging, social media, and mobile payment app\u2014on a podcast in May 2022.[11] In June, Musk told Twitter employees that Twitter is a \"digital town square\" that should be all-encompassing, like WeChat.[12] In a Morgan Stanley conference in March 2023, Musk touted X once again as the potentially \"biggest financial institution in the world\".[13] On October 27, 2022, Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, and subsequently became its CEO.[14]\nIn March 2023, Musk registered X Corp. in Nevada. On the same day, Musk registered the artificial intelligence (AI) company X.AI.[15] Later that month, Musk applied to merge X Holdings I with X Holdings Corp. and Twitter, Inc. with X Corp.[6] In the filing, Musk revealed that X Holdings Corp. had $2 million in capital, but X Holdings Corp. would serve as the parent company for X Corp.[16] In a company-wide email that month, Musk announced that Twitter employees would receive stock in X Corp.[17]\nOn May 11, 2023, Musk tweeted that he had found his replacement as Twitter and X Corp.'s CEO. The next day, on May 12, he named Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO, adding that she \"will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology\".[19] Musk said he would transition his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[20] Yaccarino succeeded Musk on June 5, 2023.[21]\nAt the end of May 2023, Fidelity Investments estimated the company's value at $15 billion.[22] This was later increased to a value of $27 billion by July,[23][24] and up to about $28.5 billion by the end of August.[25][26]\nThe company erected a giant illuminated \"X\" on the roof of its San Francisco headquarters in July 2023 without obtaining required permits. 24 complaints were filed by neighbors concerned about the bright flashing light and structural integrity. Inspectors were twice denied roof access, and the city cited the company for a building code violation. X removed the sign after a few days.[27][28]\nIn August 2023, CEO Linda Yaccarino stated that she has \"operational autonomy\" under owner Elon Musk to run the business, and that she's involved in everything that goes into running the company.[29][30] Yaccarino also opened up on the reasoning behind Twitter's \"controversial\" name change to X,[31] wherein she stated that the rebranding was essentially a \"liberation\" from Twitter. Yaccarino also went on to say that if users had stayed with Twitter, then changes would only be \"incremental\" and that with X, they think about \"what's possible\".[32]\nIn October 2023, the marketing agency X Social Media filed a lawsuit against X Corp alleging a violation its trademark of the letter X.[33]\nIn response, X Corp. mentioned that the platform encouraged diversity and free speech, stating that \"more than 99.99% of post impressions are healthy\" in a blog post.[36] The post further mentioned that the CCDH was spreading \"false and misleading claims\", which would incur financial downfall as it encouraged advertisers to halt investment on X.[37] The blog also further described the CCDH as a \"scare campaign\" working continuously to prevent \"public dialogue\", alleging that the CCDH's research utilized metrics that were purposely put \"out of context to make unsubstantiated assertions about X\".[38] X then filed a legal claim against CCDH and the European Climate Foundation, which it alleged was providing the information used in CCDH's research, and that X denied all claims stated by the CCDH.[39][40]",

        "context": "\nIn October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink\u2014a neurotechnology company developing brain\u2013computer interfaces\u2014and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.[7]\nMusk's family was wealthy during his youth.[21] His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[11] His maternal grandfather and namesake, Joshua Elon Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[23][24][25][26] Haldeman was a member of the Social Credit Party of Canada, possessed antisemitic beliefs, and supported the Technocracy movement.[27] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.[13][18] Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[28] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[23][29]\nIn 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2.[57][58] Errol Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding.[59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61] with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[51] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[62] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[63]Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[64][65] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[66]\nLater in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[67] X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[68] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[69]\nIn 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[61][69][70] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[71] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[72] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[73][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[75][76]\nIn 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk\u2014PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares\u2014received $175.8 million.[77][78] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[79][80] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[81]\nIn early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[82] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[83] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[83] With $100 million of his own money,[84] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[85][86]\nIn 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[101] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[102] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[103][c] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[106][107][108]\nTesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[116] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[117] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design,but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[118]\nFollowing a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[119][page needed][120] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[121] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[122][123] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[124] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[125]\nMusk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting\nTesla began delivery of an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[126] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[127] A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[128] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[129] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[130][131] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[132] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[133] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[134]\nSince its initial public offering in 2010,[135] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[136][137] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[138][139] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[140] In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[141] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[141] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[142] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.[143] In 2022, Musk unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.[144] On June 20, 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime MinisterNarendra Modi in New York City, suggesting that he might be interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[145]\nIn 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[146][d] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[146][150][151] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[152] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[153][154] In April 2022, the shareholder who sued Musk over the tweet, along with several Tesla shareholders, said that a federal judge had ruled that the tweet was false, although the ruling in question has not been unsealed.[155] In February 2023, the jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[156]\nIn 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[157] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet; the accusation was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[158] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[159] In 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[160][161]FOIA-released records showed that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[162]\nMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[163] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[164] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[165] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[166][167]\nTesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[168] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[169][170] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[171][172] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[173]\nIn 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[174] He is listed as the sole author of an October 2019 paper that details some of Neuralink's research,[178] although Musk's being listed as such rankled the Neuralink team's researchers.[179] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[180][181][182] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[180] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[177] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[183]\nIn 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[187][188] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[189] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[190]\nTwo tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[191][192] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[193] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[194] In 2021, tunnel construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[195]\nMusk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[197] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[198][199] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[200] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[201] making him the largest shareholder.[202][e] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 IPO.[204] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[205][206] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[202][207] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[208] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[209] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[210][211]\nTesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[212][213] He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[214] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[215] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[216] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[217] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[218] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[219] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[220]\nIn late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that majority of user wanted him to do so.[234][235] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[236]\nMusk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012\nMusk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[237]The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[238] Musk does not make formal business plans;[238] instead, he says he prefers to approach engineering problems[non sequitur] with an \"iterative design methodology\" and \"tolerance for failures\".[239] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[240] vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla's software.[237]\nMusk's handling of employees\u2014whom he communicates with directly through mass emails\u2014has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[241][242][243] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes for 80 hours per week.[244] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[245][246] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[246] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[247] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[248]\nMusk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[237] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[243][249] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[250]The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[251]\nMusk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[252][253] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[254]\nAs of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's non-profit Big Green.[255] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to non-profit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[256] which was a non-profit at the time.[257]\nVox said \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[256] The foundation has been criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated.[260] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[255] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[261] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160million to non-profits that year.[262]\nIn August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain\u2014a vacuum tube train\u2014and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[263] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the hyperloop.[264] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[265] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[266] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[267]\nIn 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015\u20132017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[268] In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[269] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from the Boring Company website in 2021.[270] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is cited to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[271]\nBiographer Ashlee Vance has noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[272]\nIn December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[273] A particular focus of the company is to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[28] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[274] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[275]\nIn 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as the latter company increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[276] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as GPT-3 (producing human-like text),[277] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[278]\nOn July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company has reportedly hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[279] The company, which is incorporated in Nevada, purchased 10,000 graphics processing units. Musk was reportedly obtaining funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[280]\nIn July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[281]Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, urged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[282] Engineers at SpaceX and the Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[283][284] By this time, however, eight of the 12 children, had already been rescued, the rescuers employing full face masks, oxygen, and anesthesia; consequently, Thai authorities declined to use the submarine.[281] In March 2019, Musk was later one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[285]\nSoon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[286] He deleted the tweets,[286] and apologized,[287] and he deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[288] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[289][290]\nIn September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in the District Court for the Central District of California.[291][292] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[36] The defamation case began in December 2019, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.[293] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. On December 6, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[294][295]\nIn September 2018, Musk was interviewed on an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he sampled a cigar laced with cannabis. [296] In 2022, Musk said that he and other Space-X employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[297] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[298]\nIn April 2019, Musk, through Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[299] The track, which refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event, was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.[300] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[301] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[302]TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[301]\nIn 2003, Musk said his favorite plane he owned was an L-39 Albatros.[303] He uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[304][305] His heavy use of the jet\u2014it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018\u2014and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[304][306]\nHis flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. The Twitter version of the account was blocked in December 2022, after Musk claimed that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed.[307][308][309] This led to Musk banning the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[310] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[311] The police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[312] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[313]\nMusk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[314] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[315]\nAt the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.[316] By the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.[317] During this period, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion on September 8, the largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index's history at the time.[318] In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.[319]\nIn January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.[320] Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.[321] On September 27, 2021, after Tesla stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world.[322] In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300 billion.[323]\nOn December 30, 2022, it was reported that Musk had lost $200 billion from his net worth due to declining stock values in Tesla, becoming the first person in history to lose such a large sum of money.[324][325] In January 2023, Musk was recognized by Guinness World Records for experiencing the \"largest loss of personal fortune in history\" with regards to his financial losses since November 2021, which Guinness quoted a Forbes estimate of $182 billion.[326]\nAround 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020,[319] a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022,[f] after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021.[328] Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.[317] The deal stipulated that Musk only received the compensation if Tesla reached certain market values.[329] It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.[330] In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.[330][329]\nMusk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.[331] According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.[332] He claimed his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.[331]\nSince joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[336] Musk has been an active user and has over 100 million followers as of June 2022[update].[337] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[338] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[339][340] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[341]The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[342] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[343] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[344][345] The Israel government and several media outlets accused Musk of antisemitism due to him spreading George Soros conspiracy theories,[346] although some Israeli officials defended Musk.[347]\nWhile often described as libertarian, Musk has called himself \"politically moderate\" and was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. The New York Times wrote that Musk \"expresses views that don't fit neatly into [the American] binary, left-right political framework\".[370] Historically, Musk has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[371] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest.[370] Beginning in the late 2010s, Musk's political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[372]\nIn March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[414][415] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[411] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[412]Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[416] Musk also claimed falsely that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[417][418]\nIn March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[425] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[426] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[425] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[427][428]\nIn September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[429][430] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[431] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen,\" which then trended on Twitter.[431][432] In December 2021, Musk revealed that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[433]\nMusk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[443][444]Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[445] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[446][447]\nIn December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[448] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[449]\nMusk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[450] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[451] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[452] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[453] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[454][455]\nDespite the Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[456][457][458] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[457][459][458]\nMusk has 10 surviving children.[467] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[468] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[469] After his death, the couple used IVF to continue their family;[470] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[470] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody.[471][472] In 2022, one of the twins (his eldest) officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity as a trans woman and to use Wilson as her last name because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[473] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists.\"[474]\nIn 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[475] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[476][477] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[478] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[478] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[479] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[480] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[481]\nIn 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating.[482] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[483][484] According to Musk and Grimes, his name was \"X \u00c6 A-12\" (/\u025bks\u00e6\u0283e\u026a\u02c8tw\u025blv/); however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[485][486] and was then changed to \"X \u00c6 A-Xii\". This drew more confusion, as \u00c6 is not a letter in the modern English alphabet.[487] The child was eventually named X AE A-XII Musk, with \"X\" as a first name, \"AE A-XII\" as a middle name, and \"Musk\" as surname.[488] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l Musk (nicknamed \"Y\"), born via surrogacy.[2] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[489][490] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[2] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[491] In September 2023 it was revealed that the pair had a third child, a son named Techno Mechanicus \"Tau\" Musk.[4]\nIn July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[492] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[493] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[494] Musk denied the report.[495]\nMusk has also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \u201can occasional girlfriend.\u201d[496]\nIn May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[497] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[498][499] After the release of the Business Insider article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[500] decreasing Musk's net worth by $10 billion.[501]Barron's wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk \u2013 the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[502]\nIn April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[503] In May, a judge granted the U.S. Virgin Islands' request to serve Musk electronically through Tesla after the U.S. territory had difficulty locating him.[503] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[503]\nMusk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[504][505]\nBen Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million.

        "context": "\nThe first season of The Mandalorian premiered with the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019. A second season premiered on October 30, 2020, and a third season premiered on March 1, 2023. A fourth season is in development. Interconnected spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew expand on The Mandalorian's timeframe, with an untitled feature film directed by Filoni set to serve as a conclusion to the interconnected stories.\nBeginning five years after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983) and the fall of the Galactic Empire,[1][2]The Mandalorian follows Din Djarin, a lone Mandalorian bounty hunter in the outer reaches of the galaxy.[2] He is hired by Imperial remnant forces to retrieve the child Grogu, but instead goes on the run to protect the infant.[3][4] While looking to reunite Grogu with his kind, they are pursued by Moff Gideon, who wants to use Grogu's connection to the Force.[5][4] The duo then travel to Mandalore so Din Djarin can redeem himself for the transgression of removing his helmet.[6]\nSackhoff returns to star in the third season, while Swallow,[31] Weathers,[32] Sedaris,[33] Abtahi,[14] Varnado,[34] and Esposito returned as co-stars.[35] Wayne and Crowder receive co-star credit beginning with the third season.[36]\nStar Wars creator George Lucas began development on a live-action Star Wars television series known as Underworld in early 2009. More than 50 scripts were written for the series by 2012, but they were eventually deemed too expensive to produce.[37] In January 2013, ABC president Paul Lee stated that his network would be discussing potential live-action Star Wars television series with Lucasfilm after the latter had been sold by Lucas to ABC's parent company The Walt Disney Company in October 2012.[38] In November 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that Disney and Lucasfilm were developing a live-action Star Wars television series for the new streaming service Disney+.[39]\nWhile working on The Lion King (2019), a photo-realistic remake of the 1994 animated film, in 2017, director Jon Favreau pitched an idea he had for a Star Wars television series featuring Mandalorians to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.[40][41]Dave Filoni, executive producer on the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels, had also been conceiving a Mandalorian-focused series, and Kennedy suggested that he and Favreau meet to discuss their ideas.[41] Favreau and Filoni had previously met at the Skywalker Ranch when Favreau was working on Iron Man (2008) and Filoni was working on the first season of The Clone Wars, and Favreau subsequently voiced the Mandalorian character Pre Vizsla in The Clone Wars for Filoni.[9] When Favreau met with Filoni about his series idea, they were able to combine Filoni's knowledge of Mandalorian history with Favreau's lone-gunslinger concept.[41] Filoni also drew a doodle of a baby of the same species as the Star Wars character Yoda which became \"The Child\".[40] Favreau wanted to explore the \"scum and villainy\" of the Star Wars universe following the events of the film Return of the Jedi (1983).[9] He began spending several hours at the end of each day developing the series while he was directing The Lion King.[40]\nLucasfilm announced that Favreau would write and executive produce a new Star Wars series for Disney+ in March 2018. Kennedy added that the series was an opportunity for a diverse group of writers and directors to be hired to create Star Wars stories after the franchise's films had been criticized for being written and directed solely by white men.[42] In May, Favreau stated that he had written scripts for four of the series' eight episodes before being officially hired for the project.[43] On October 3, Favreau announced that the series was titled The Mandalorian and revealed the premise for the show.[2] The following day, Lucasfilm announced that Filoni, Kennedy, and Colin Wilson would executive produce the series alongside Favreau, with Karen Gilchrist acting as co-executive producer.[44] The series premiere was set to be available with the launch of Disney+ in November 2019.[45] Star Pedro Pascal described the series as taking the space Western undertones from the Star Wars films \"and infusing it with steroids\".[46]\nIn July 2019, Favreau confirmed that there would be a second season of the series and that he had begun writing it.[47] Iger announced in February 2020 that the second season would premiere that October.[48] By late April, Favreau had been writing a third season for \"a while\" and further development on the season was beginning.[49] In September, co-star Giancarlo Esposito said the second season would \"start to lay the groundwork for the depth and breadth that's going to come in season 3 and season 4, where you're really gonna start to get answers\".[50]Rick Famuyiwa, who directed in the first two seasons, was made an executive producer for the third season.[51] By late May 2022, Favreau was writing a fourth season,[52] noting it was being informed by the series Ahsoka (2023) and Skeleton Crew (2023).[52][53] Writing for the fourth season was completed by February 2023,[53] with pre-production occurring by that April. Filming was reportedly expected to begin by the end of 2023.[54]\nIn November 2018, Pedro Pascal was confirmed to be portraying the Mandalorian after being rumored to be cast in the role for some time.[7] Pascal initially thought he was being cast as the Star Wars character Boba Fett because of the visual similarities between that character and the Mandalorian,[55] but the latter is a separate character named Din Djarin.[8] Favreau called Pascal \"a classic movie star\" who \"had the presence and skill[s]\" necessary to portray a character largely concealed under a helmet.[56] The Mandalorian is also portrayed by stunt doubles Brendan Wayne, Lateef Crowder,[10] and Barry Lowin.[57] Pascal worked with Favreau and Filoni to record the character's dialogue later.[58][56]\nIn February 2021, Lucasfilm said Gina Carano, a recurring co-star during the first two seasons, was no longer employed by the company. This came after Carano made a social media post comparing being a Republican in the United States to the treatment of Jewish people during the Holocaust, with Lucasfilm saying the post was \"abhorrent and unacceptable\".[59] Carano had been repeatedly warned about her social media posts by Lucasfilm executives who reportedly had been looking for a reason to fire her for two months. The February 2021 posts were \"the final straw\", and the decision to fire the actress was made by Lucasfilm executives rather than Favreau.[59][60] The Walt Disney Company's then-CEO Bob Chapek said Carano was fired because her posts did not align with the values of Disney, which he said were \"universal\" and not political.[61]The Hollywood Reporter reported that Carano's role of Cara Dune was not expected to be recast, though industry insiders felt that was still a possibility because of story and merchandising reasons.[60]\nVisual effects studio Industrial Light & Magic, a subsidiary of Lucasfilm, opened a new division in November 2018 called ILM TV, specifically intended for episodic and streaming television. Based in London with support from ILM's San Francisco, Vancouver, and Singapore locations, one of the first projects for the new division was The Mandalorian.[69] While directing The Jungle Book (2016), Favreau had used large screens on set to create interactive lighting so when live-action footage was combined with a digital environment in post-production the effect would be more realistic. He found the process to be effective, but time-consuming.[70] When he began working on The Lion King, Favreau worked with visual effects vendor Moving Picture Company, technology developer Magnopus, and the game engine software Unity to develop a new virtual camera system that allowed him to film scenes in a virtual reality environment as if he was filming with physical cameras. For The Lion King, the results of the virtual photography were then rendered by MPC as the final animation for the film.[3] On The Mandalorian, Favreau wanted to use virtual technology to aid live-action photography and also develop the video wall system.[3][70] ILM partnered with video game developer Epic Games to create a new system named StageCraft based on Epic's game engine Unreal Engine. StageCraft consists of large LED video screens on which digital environments can be rendered in real-time for actors to perform in front of.[71][3]\nDuring pre-production, the virtual photography process developed for The Lion King was used to plan the series' filming and determine what environments would be needed on set. The digital environments were then created by ILM and added to StageCraft ready for live-action photography with the actors. Some of these environments were based on location photography in countries such as Iceland and Chile, on which Favreau said, \"The actors aren't brought on location. The location is brought to the actors.\"[3] The environments were designed by the series' visual art department, led by Lucasfilm's creative director Doug Chiang and production designer Andrew L. Jones.[72] During filming, the digital environments were rendered on a video wall in real-time, allowing the filmmakers and actors to see the environments.[71] ILM used a smaller version of the technology for Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), but on The Mandalorian they utilized a 21-foot-tall (6.4 m) set that was 75 feet (23 m) in diameter, surrounded by a 360-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling. The Manhattan Beach Studios set is referred to as a \"volume\", which is traditionally the name for motion capture stages.[71][3] Favreau's initial intention was to use the video wall as a way to provide realistic interactive lighting for the actors, with a section of the screen behind the actors displaying a green screen so a higher quality version of the background could be added in post-production. During filming tests with the technology, the team realized that the Unreal Engine could render visuals fast enough that they could have the background move with the camera. This allowed the system to maintain the appearance of parallax, where the environment would appear differently based on the angle it was being looked at just as a real 3D environment would. This effect causes some distortion to the image on the video wall but looks like a real environment when viewed through the camera.[70] The images rendered on the video wall in real-time were often of a high enough quality to be used as final effects when filmed on set.[71]\nPhysical elements were added to the volume to match the digital backgrounds, such as dirt on the floor to match the dirt displayed on the video wall.[70] Interior spaces were also created, such as an office used by Imperial agents where the walls and ceiling were displayed on the video wall around a physical table.[71] The production had several physical sections of the Razor Crest, the Mandalorian's ship, that could be placed within the volume, such as having the front half of the ship physically built and the back half rendered digitally.[70][71] The environments could be manipulated in StageCraft on set as required, allowing the filmmakers to request changes to the environment and have them rendered on the video wall on the same day.[71] The production was able to change between environments within half an hour, or even faster if the physical elements within the volume were not visible and did not need to be changed.[70] One of the primary advantages of using video wall technology was the realistic lighting, with the wall providing ambient light and accurate reflections on the actors. This was especially important for the Mandalorian, who wears reflective armor. Traditionally, on production using a green screen, the visual effects team would have to remove the green reflections from a reflective character or object in post-production, and then add new reflections that matched the digital environment. Using StageCraft, the reflections in the Mandalorian's armor were already correct on set. It also allowed for the series' cinematographers to light scenes in a way that would match the background, rather than lighting the set and hoping the digital background would match in post-production as they would have to do with the green screen. A technique used by the production to ensure the lighting from the video wall looked natural was to have the actors in shadow, with light from the environment behind them, often creating silhouettes.[70]\nComposer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson was recommended by several of his previous collaborators to Favreau, including directors Ryan Coogler and Anthony and Joe Russo, and musician Donald Glover. Favreau knew that music would be important to the series due to the impact of John Williams' score on the Star Wars films, but also wanted the music of the series to be different from the films. He wanted the series to sound \"a little grittier, a little edgier and a little more tech-oriented\".[73] G\u00f6ransson first met with Favreau in November 2018,[74] when Favreau showed the composer concept art for the series and discussed his inspirations for the story and tone, including Western and samurai films. They also discussed how they felt when they first heard Williams' Star Wars music, and G\u00f6ransson set out to recreate those feelings and \"capture the soul of what Star Wars is\" but in a new way.[75]\nG\u00f6ransson was announced as the composer for the series in December 2018.[76] The basis of the main theme was created from G\u00f6ransson experimenting with a bass recorder, digitally manipulating it to make it more \"futuristic\". Guitars, a piano, drums, and synthesizers are also featured in the main theme.[75] A 70-piece orchestra was used for the first season,[73][74] combined with recordings of G\u00f6ransson playing the main instruments which he augmented with synthesizers and other digital manipulation.[74]Walt Disney Records released a soundtrack album for each episode of the first season.[74] Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, orchestra players were recorded remotely or in smaller, distant groups for the second season.[5] Two albums were released for the second season, each covering four episodes of the season.[77][78] In February 2023, Joseph Shirley was revealed to be scoring the third season. Shirley previously provided additional music for the first two seasons and used G\u00f6ransson's themes to compose the score for The Book of Boba Fett.[79]\nOne of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the father\u2013son relationship dynamic between Din Djarin and the Child.[80][81][82] Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote that this is unusual in Star Wars stories and that past examples of parenting in the franchise have tended to be poor ones, from the murderous Darth Vader, father of Luke Skywalker, to the neglectful Galen Erso, father of Jyn Erso in Rogue One (2016).[80] Britt wrote: \"For years the Star Wars franchise avoided depicting a parent-child dynamic. With Mando and Baby Yoda, that's finally changing.\"[80] The dynamic between Kuiil and IG-11 also reflect the childrearing theme in The Mandalorian. The two have a relationship similar to that of a father and son, as demonstrated in the scene in which Kuiil teaches IG-11 how to operate and function after the droid is reprogrammed.[83]\nVulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk argued that parenting has been the subject of past Star Wars stories, but almost always during later stages of parenthood, rather than an infant in early stages such as the Child. As examples, she cited Obi-Wan Kenobi serving as a mentor to the adolescent Anakin Skywalker, Princess Leia lamenting over her grown son Kylo Ren, or the absence of Rey's parents.[84] Britt argued strong parental examples in Star Wars are important because the franchise is so often associated with the childhoods of its fans.[80]The Mandalorian particularly highlights the challenges of being a single parent[81][82] and a working parent since the Mandalorian struggles to continue his day job as a bounty hunter and mercenary while serving as the sole caretaker of the Child.[84][82] Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter described the show as \"the adventures of a single dad looking for a job\".[85] Several reviewers have compared the dynamic between the Child and the Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub, a manga about a samurai warrior and his young son.[86][87][88][89] Favreau acknowledged Lone Wolf and Cub as an influence in an episode of Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian.[90]\nThe Mandalorian's parental role in the series makes him a softer and more relatable character;[91] he changes in a positive way because of raising the Child, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed.[92] He risked his life and drastically changed his career as a bounty hunter to accept his responsibility as the Child's caretaker and guardian,[81][82] marking a significant parental sacrifice.[82] When the Mandalorian seeks work to earn money, he is now doing so to provide not only for himself, but for the Child as well.[81] We see several examples of the Mandalorian parenting the Child throughout the series, such as when he stops the Child from pressing random buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship, ultimately by holding him in his lap.[80] In another example, the Mandalorian establishes a car seat for the Child in the cockpit of his ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their travels.[93]\nThe relationship between the Mandalorian and the Child is an example of unexpected fatherhood.[84][92] The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".[84] Nevertheless, fatherhood is not a role the Mandalorian initially seeks, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility. He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he first leaves the Child with the Client.[92] He does so again in \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\" when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan, who is willing to take the Child into her own family. The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first-season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\" when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.[84] He nonetheless continues to search for what he feels may be a more appropriate guardian for the Child, as in the second season's fifth episode, \"The Jedi\", in which he seeks to leave him with Ahsoka Tano.[94]\nSeveral writers suggested the fact that the Mandalorian's face is concealed has a tabula rasa effect and his anonymity allows viewers to see and imagine themselves as parents.[80][81] Britt said this \"allow(s) us to dream about what arsenal we might deploy to protect our children\".[80] However, Singer said the show's setting in space make the challenges of child-rearing seem more exciting and exotic than they might otherwise be.[81] Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent's psyche like a dentist's drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"[95] Likewise, Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"The Mandalorian is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"[84] VanAnderonk described this as a wish fulfillment fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that's left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".[84]\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.[84] Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,[81] as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.[81][96] An interaction the Mandalorian has with Peli Motto in \"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger\" is one of the most overt discussions about the challenges of caring for the Child. When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"[84] She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".[97]ScreenCrush writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.[81] Eileen Chase of Today echoed this: \"He is not an ideal parent, just like the rest of us who have to balance parenting and work.\"[82]\nThe nature of good and evil and the question of nature versus nurture is raised repeatedly throughout The Mandalorian, perhaps most overtly through Kuiil's reprogramming of IG-11 from a bounty hunter to a nurse droid and protector.[98][99] Even after IG-11 is reprogrammed, the Mandalorian does not believe he has truly changed, because he believes droids have an essential nature and that IG-11's nature remains murderous and untrustworthy.[100] But in reprogramming IG-11, Kuiil nurtures him and helps him to change; Kuiil feels that in the process of learning how to function again, IG-11 gained a new personality.[101] Kuiil insists to the Mandalorian: \"Droids are not good or bad \u2014 they are neutral reflections of those who program them.\"[99] Keith Phipps of Vulture wrote of IG-11 and the nature versus nurture theme: \"He's not bad. He's just programmed that way, and with care and change he can do a lot of good in the world.\"[98]\nThe Kuiil and IG-11 scenes also demonstrate that how the \"child\" character is raised makes a significant difference in whether the child becomes an asset or a threat to those around him. The droid was a dangerous assassin before Kuiil reprogrammed him, but thanks to the Ugnaught's parenting, he becomes a protector and helper instead.[83] Some writers have likewise suggested the Child is not inherently good or evil,[99][102] but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him. He is learning about the world around him and needs guidance as he develops his abilities.[96][99][103] It will largely fall to the Mandalorian to provide this guidance,[96] as when the Mandalorian stops him from strangling Cara Dune.[99]\nHowever, multiple writers have questioned whether the violent acts the Child has repeatedly witnessed throughout The Mandalorian are hurting his development and that he is learning to become violent himself as a result.[99][104] Phipps wrote of this: \"That look of wonder in the Child's eyes as IG-11 kills and kills again is hilarious, but also a little chilling.\"[98] One particular scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many reviewers and fans to question whether the Child may be demonstrating evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly arm wrestling match. During the contest, the Child uses the Force to choke Cara, nearly strangling her before the Mandalorian intervened.[102][103][104] Throughout the Star Wars franchise, that ability has been most commonly associated with the Dark Side of the Force, particularly Darth Vader.[104][105][106]\nSarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant wrote: \"The moment is genuinely shocking \u2014 and more than a little disturbing.\"[99] Some reviewers noted, however, that the Child likely mistakenly believed the Mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help.[106][107] Additionally, in the same episode, the Child uses Force healing to save Greef Karga, a power typically associated with the Light Side.[99][102][107] Nevertheless, some writers have suggested viewers had been underestimating the Child's capacity for evil because he is so adorable.[106][105][108] Fans speculated the Child could be presenting a false personality or using the Force to manipulate people into caring about him to help ensure his survival.[104] However, Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle suggested rather than building toward making the Child evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.[104]\nAccording to Nielsen, The Mandalorian's first season amassed 5.42 billion minutes of viewing time during its seven-week run, topping at 1.15 billion minutes during the week its finale premiered.[112] It added 800 million more minutes the week after its finale.[112] According to Nielsen, the second season became the most watched streaming television series in the U.S. from December 14 to December 20, with 1.336 billion minutes of viewing time.[113] It also ranked at the fourteenth place on Nielsen's list of most watched streaming television shows and movies of 2020 with 14.5 billion minutes watched during the year.[113] The show became the first non-Netflix show that landed at number one on Nielsen's streaming ranker.[114] According to Samba TV, the show's second season drew 1.04 million households.[115]The Hollywood Reporter reported that The Mandalorian lead Disney+'s live action series with the majority minutes (8.4 billion) came from the eight weeks the second season debuted.[112]\nFor the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating with an average rating of 7.9/10 based on 337 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Action-packed and expertly-crafted\u2014if at times a bit too withholding\u2014The Mandalorian is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe that benefits greatly from the cuteness of its cargo.\"[116]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 70 out of 100 for the season, based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[117]\nFor the second season, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating with an average score of 8.5/10, based on 450 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"With fan favorites and fresh faces galore both in front of and behind the camera, The Mandalorian's sophomore season solidifies its place as one of Star Wars's most engaging and exciting sagas.\"[118] Metacritic assigned a score of 76 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[119]\nFor the third season, Rotten Tomatoes has reported a 85% approval rating with an average score of 7.55/10, based on 239 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Mileage may vary by a couple parsecs as The Mandalorian becomes more and more about the connective tissue of broader Star Wars lore, but this remains one of the most engaging adventures in a galaxy far, far away.\"[120] Metacritic has assigned a score of 70 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[121]\nThe Mandalorian was the first production to be filmed using real-time rendering for realistic, parallax environments.[70] Favreau believed that the StageCraft technology developed for the series would have a significant impact on the production of films and television series moving forward.[71] He attributed the breakthroughs made with the technology to the support of Kathleen Kennedy, who was in charge of both Lucasfilm and ILM, as well as to his drive for innovation, and to previous work done by George Lucas on new technology for the Star Wars films. Favreau also acknowledged that much of the technology involved in StageCraft is not proprietary and is readily available to others, it just had not been combined in this way before.[70] Favreau invited other filmmakers and studios to visit the series' set and see how the new technology was being used, noting that Lucas and other filmmakers such as James Cameron had done the same when they had been working on innovative film projects. Favreau added that the companies working on the series' new technologies\u2014including ILM, Epic, and MPC\u2014were being encouraged to share their work and develop the technology further beyond the requirements of the series.[3] Several actors working on the series, including Carl Weathers and Giancarlo Esposito, gave high praise to the technology and the way it allowed them to act within the environment rather than pretend in front of a green screen.[70] After learning lessons about the technology during the production of the first season of The Mandalorian, ILM was able to make several advancements beginning with the second season. This included transitioning StageCraft to a fully in-house product utilizing ILM's game engine, Helios, rather than Epic's Unreal Engine.[72] In February 2020, ILM announced that it was making its StageCraft technology available to all filmmakers and production studios as a complete end-to-end solution,[71] and that December, it was announced that three additional StageCraft volumes\u2013in Los Angeles, London, and Australia\u2013were being built.[134]\nIn November 2019, Walt Disney Studios CCO Alan Horn said if the series was successful, a film featuring the Mandalorian could be developed.[135] The next month, Favreau said there was an opportunity to explore the series' characters in other Star Wars films or television series.[3] Bob Iger said in February 2020 that spin-offs of The Mandalorian were being considered, and there was potential to add more characters to the series to then give them their series.[136] Favreau said in October that as more characters are introduced in the series, \"we are beginning to explore where we could go\". He felt Lucasfilm could be \"more responsive\" to audience reactions in determining potential spin-offs due to the faster production time for television series than films. Favreau looked to his experience working in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where smaller stories exist within the larger narrative, as a potential guide for spin-offs. Additionally, both Favreau and Pascal were open to the idea of the Mandalorian appearing in a Star Wars film, but Favreau was in \"no rush\" to do this.[137]\nIn December 2020, the spin-off series Rangers of the New Republic, Ahsoka, and The Book of Boba Fett were announced,[138][139][140] with all three series developed by Favreau and Filoni, set within The Mandalorian's timeframe and planned to culminate in a \"climactic story event\".[141] Before Lucasfilm announced that Carano was no longer employed by the company in February 2021, The Hollywood Reporter had reported that there was potential for her to star in Rangers of the New Republic.[59] Active development on the series had not begun by that May,[142] and it was still on hold in November when Kennedy said the development had not reached a point where scripts were written. She said there was potential for ideas from the series to be incorporated into The Mandalorian's \"next iteration\".[143] A new series, Skeleton Crew, was announced in May 2022 after being developed by Jon Watts and Christopher Ford. Favreau and Filoni were revealed to be serving as executive producers on the series,[144] which is also set in the timeframe of The Mandalorian and Ahsoka.[145]\nFavreau discussed the spin-offs in August 2022, explaining that The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew were all set in the same timeframe\u2014during the 30 years between Return of the Jedi and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)\u2014which had \"a lot of room for us to tell stories, and there are a lot of characters that are in play because we know who's around at that time\". He noted that they were using The Mandalorian to remind fans of these characters or introduce them to unfamiliar audiences before they appeared in the spin-off series, which created interconnected stories and characters within a \"very rich fabric for us to explore\".[146]\nA spin-off miniseries focused on Boba Fett was reported in November 2020.[147] It was officially announced as The Book of Boba Fett a month later and was already in production by that point. Favreau, Filoni, and Robert Rodriguez executive produced, with Morrison and Wen reprising their respective roles as Fett and Fennec Shand.[140] Pascal, Swallow, Sedaris,[148] Olyphant, Dawson, and Hamill also reprise their roles,[149] along with Favreau as the voice of Paz Vizsla, Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Carson Teva,[148] and W. Earl Brown as the Weequay bartender.[150] Grogu also appears.[149] The seven-episode series was released from December 2021 to February 2022.[151]\nA limited series titled Ahsoka, featuring Dawson reprising her role as Ahsoka Tano, was revealed in December 2020 with Filoni writing and executive producing alongside Favreau.[139] The series premiered on August 22, 2023.[152] Lee reprises his role as Carson Teva in the series,[153] while Brendan Wayne appears as Lieutenant Lander.[154]\nA new series, Skeleton Crew, was announced in May 2022 after being developed by Jon Watts and Christopher Ford. Favreau and Filoni were revealed to be serving as executive producers on the series,[144] which is also set in the timeframe of The Mandalorian and Ahsoka.[145] The series is scheduled to be released in 2023.[155]\nIn December 2020, it was revealed that The Mandalorian and its related series were planned to culminate in a \"climactic story event\".[141] At Star Wars Celebration London in April 2023, it was announced that Filoni was directing a feature film that would serve as the conclusion to the interconnected stories of The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka, among others.[156]\nA documentary series, Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian, features interviews with the cast and crew of The Mandalorian, behind-the-scenes footage, and roundtable conversations hosted by Favreau that explore the production of the series. The first season premiered on Disney+ on May 4, 2020, Star Wars Day.[157] An hour-long special covering the second season was released on December 25, 2020,[158] with a second special episode covering the season two finale released on August 25, 2021.[159] A special covering the third season was released on June 28, 2023.[160]\nLucasfilm announced a publishing campaign of tie-in books and comics for the series in June 2020. The campaign was announced to include The Art of The Mandalorian (Season One) by Phil Szostak, an original adult novel written by Adam Christopher and published by Del Rey Books, a visual guide written by Pablo Hidalgo and published by DK, a junior novelization of the first season written by Joe Schreiber, and comic books inspired by the series to be published by Marvel Comics and IDW.[161] One month later, the novel by Christopher was delayed from December 2020 to November 2021, before both it and the visual guide by Hidalgo was canceled in March 2021.[162][163] Hidalgo stated in December 2021 that the publishing program had been put on hold to avoid any potential contradictions or restrictions that may have arisen between the published material and the spin-off series in development.[164]\nIn May 2021, Stern Pinball released a Pinball game based on the first two seasons of the Mandalorian featuring the Razor Crest and Grogu characters with voice callouts by actor Carl Weathers and music from composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson.[171]",

        "context": "\nRonaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \u20ac94 million (\u00a380 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La D\u00e9cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \u20ac100 million (\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[20] where his father was the kit man,[12] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of \u00a31,500.[21] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy.[21] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[22] With a troubled life as a student[23] and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[24][25] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \"disrespected\" him.[22] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[26] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[27] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[28] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.[29]\nRonaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP's museum\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6l\u00f6ni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[30] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[21]Sporting CP B was the 1st team in his senior career, where he debuted in a 2\u20131 away loss against Sport Clube Lusit\u00e2nia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divis\u00e3o B championship played in the Azores.[31] On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3\u20130 win.[32] Over the course of the 2002\u201303 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[33] Manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[34]\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3\u20131 at the inauguration of the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[35] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting \u00a312.24 million[35] for what he considered to be \"one of the most exciting young players\" he had ever seen.[36] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[37]\n\"There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me.\"\n\u2014Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003.[38]\nRonaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003\u201304 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[39] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[40] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[41] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[42] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\"[43]\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4\u20130 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[44] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\" he had ever seen.[38] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[45] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[46] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[47] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3\u20130 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[48] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[49] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \"elaborate\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[50] but teammate Gary Neville said he was \"not a show pony, but the real thing\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[51]\n\"He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening.\"\nRonaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4\u20131 loss to Middlesbrough.[52] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010.[53] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004\u201305 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[54][55] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5\u20134.[56] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4\u20130 final win over Wigan Athletic.[57]\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \"one-fingered gesture\" towards Benfica fans,[58] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3\u20131 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[59] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[60] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[61] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[62] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[63]\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006\u201307 season,[64] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[65] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[66][67][68] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[69]\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6\u20130 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table.[82] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2\u20130 win.[83] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967\u201368 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[84] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[85] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[86] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[87][88] In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2\u20131 on aggregate;[89] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3\u20130 aggregate win over Roma.[90] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[91] United emerged victorious 1\u20131, winning the penalties 6\u20135.[92][93] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[94]\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007\u201308 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[95] As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[96] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \"modern slavery\".[97] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[98] he remained at United for another year.[99]\nRonaldo in 2009 with Manchester United playing in a Premier League game against Liverpool\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[108] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[109] United advanced to the final in Rome,[110] where he made little impact in United's 2\u20130 defeat to Barcelona.[111] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup.[112][113] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[114] His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.[115]\nAs his usual number 7 was unavailable, Ronaldo wore number 9 during his debut season at Madrid. After Ra\u00fal departed the club, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt before the 2010\u201311 season.\nAhead of the 2009\u201310 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million).[116] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth \u20ac11 million per year and contained a \u20ac1 billion buy-out clause.[117] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[118] Since club captain Ra\u00fal already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[119] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[120]\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3\u20132 home win.[121] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[122] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Z\u00fcrich.[123] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[124][125] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almer\u00eda.[126] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4\u20131 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga,[127][128] and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.[129][130]\nFollowing Ra\u00fal's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010\u201311 season.[131] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6\u20131 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[132] Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and M\u00e1laga.[133][134][135] Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[136] During a historic series of four Cl\u00e1sicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain.[137][138] His two goals in the last match of the season against Almer\u00eda made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[139] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[140]\nRonaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain.\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions.[141] He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, M\u00e1laga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.[142][143][144] Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona,[145] he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s.[146] Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.[147] His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi,[148] though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.[149]\nRonaldo began the 2012\u201313 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4\u20134 aggregate draw against Barcelona.[150] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \"professional issue\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,[151] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4\u20131 win over Ajax.[152] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Cl\u00e1sicos when he hit a brace in a 2\u20132 draw at Camp Nou.[153] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[154]\nFollowing the 2012\u201313 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4\u20133 win over Sociedad on 6 January.[155] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[156] Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.[157] He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6\u20132 win against M\u00e1laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.[158] He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Cl\u00e1sico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[159] a club record.[150] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2\u20131 extra time defeat to Atl\u00e9tico, but was shown a red card for violent conduct.[160] In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw at home,[161] he scored the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win on his first return to Old Trafford.[162] He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect.[163] After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4\u20131 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2\u20130 win in the second leg.[164]\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La D\u00e9cima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3\u20130 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before.[173] After hitting a brace in a 4\u20130 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena,[174] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4\u20131 final win over Atl\u00e9tico, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[175] His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\".[176] As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[177] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[178]\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atl\u00e9tico at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n,[179] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.[180] His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2\u20131 to claim the trophy.[181] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Su\u00e1rez.[182] Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eus\u00e9bio, who had died two days before.[183] A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional,[184] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[185]\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season Ronaldo scored a personal best of 61 goals in all competitions.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2\u20130 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[186] He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds.[187] His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches.[187][188] After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup,[189] Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or,[190] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient.[191] Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League.[192] In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2\u20130 win against Schalke 04.[193] He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3\u20132 on aggregate.[194] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[195] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9\u20131 rout of Granada.[196] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2\u20130 win against Rayo Vallecano.[197] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di St\u00e9fano's club record of 28.[186] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[186]\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015\u201316 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6\u20130 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Ra\u00fal.[198] A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Ra\u00fal when he scored the second goal in a 3\u20130 defeat of Levante at the Bernab\u00e9u to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals.[note 4] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[200] Two goals against Malm\u00f6 FF in a 2\u20130 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country.[201] He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malm\u00f6.[202]\nRonaldo's four goals in a 7\u20131 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi.[203] He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals.[204] The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.[205] Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atl\u00e9tico, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory.[206] For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions.[206] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.[207]\nIn the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2\u20131 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[216] In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4\u20132 after extra-time.[217] On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atl\u00e9tico 3\u20130 in the Champions League semi-final first leg. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo.[218] He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012.[219] In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4\u20131 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career.[220] Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.[221]\nAt the start of the 2017\u201318 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3\u20131 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg.[222] On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.[223] On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund.[224] A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.[225] On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Gr\u00eamio in the final.[226] On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3\u20131 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi.[227] On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6\u20133 win against Girona.[228]\nOn 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3\u20130 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a \"PlayStation goal\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches.[229] On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3\u20131 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4\u20133 on aggregate.[230] It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club.[231] In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3\u20131, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so.[232] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals.[233] After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.[234]\nDespite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,[235] on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a \u20ac100 million transfer, which included an additional \u20ac12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs.[236] The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[237] and the highest paid by an Italian club.[238] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[239] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino P\u00e9rez.[240]\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3\u20132 away win against Chievo Verona.[241] On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2\u20131 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career.[242] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for \"violent conduct\", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances.[243] Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107's winner in a 1\u20130 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition.[244] In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3\u20130 away win over Fiorentina.[245] After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modri\u0107, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate.[246] Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.[247]\nOn 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3\u20130 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal.[248] On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 home win against Atl\u00e9tico in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals.[249] The following month, he scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening the scoring in a 1\u20131 away draw in the quarter-final first leg against Ajax on 10 April.[250] In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, he scored the opening goal, but Juventus eventually lost the match 2\u20131 and were eliminated from the competition.[251] On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2\u20131 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy.[252] On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser in a 1\u20131 away draw against Derby d'Italia rivals Inter Milan.[253] Ending his first Serie A campaign with 21 goals and 8 assists, Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A award for Most Valuable Player.[254]\nOn 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2\u20130 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history.[264] On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal from a free kick in a 4\u20131 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar S\u00edvori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts.[265] On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2\u20131 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season.[266][267] Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[268] On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2\u20130 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[269] He finished his second league campaign with 31 goals, making him the second-highest goalscorer in the league behind only European Golden Shoe winner Ciro Immobile, with 36 goals.[270][271] On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2\u20131 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season.[272] Despite the win, the tie finished 2\u20132 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.[273]\nOn 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus's opening league match of the season, a 3\u20130 home win over Sampdoria.[274] On 1 November, having taken nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4\u20131 away win.[275] On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match, his 750th senior career goal.[276] Ronaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13 December, scoring two penalties in a 3\u20131 away win over Genoa in the league to bring his goal tally to 79.[277] On 20 January 2021, Juventus won the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana after a 2\u20130 win against Napoli, with Ronaldo scoring the opening goal.[278] On 2 March, he scored a goal in a 3\u20130 win over Spezia in his 600th league match, to become the first player to score at least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the top five leagues of Europe.[279] On 14 March, he scored his 57th career hat-trick in a 3\u20131 away win over Cagliari.[280] On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3\u20131 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat.[281] With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy.[282] Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.[283]\nOn 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for \u00c1lvaro Morata in a 2\u20132 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR.[284] Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window,[285] and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had \"no intention\" of remaining a Juventus player.[286] On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms,[287] but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer.[288] On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him,[289][290] while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.[291][292]\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[293] The transfer was for an initial \u00a312.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.[294] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[295] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[296]\nRonaldo in a Premier League match against Newcastle in September 2021, his first game back at Manchester United\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4\u20131 league victory against Newcastle United.[297] On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2\u20131 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.[298] In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\u20132 home victory against Atalanta,[299] and scored both goals, including a last minute equaliser, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November.[300] On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2\u20130 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners.[301] On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3\u20132 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.[302]\nThe following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal,[303] before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2\u20130 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022.[304] Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3\u20132 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals,[305] although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals.[306] On 16 April, Ronaldo scored his 50th club hat-trick in a 3\u20132 win over Norwich City.[307] On 23 April, he scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to Arsenal.[308] After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.[309]\nHe finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season;[310][311] however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.[312]\nAfter growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans.[313] His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer.[314] However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wages demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.[315]\nHaving failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2\u20130 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September.[316] On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6\u20133 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of \"respect for his big career\".[317] On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2\u20131 win against Everton.[318] Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle;[319][320] Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team.[321][322] Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage.[323] Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was \"an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role\".[324] Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.[325]\nOn 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt \"betrayed\" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag \"because he doesn't show respect for me\", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club.[326] Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early.[326] He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a \"sporting director and not even a coach\".[326][327] On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was \"no evolution\" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in \"technology, infrastructure\".[326][327] Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family \"did not care about the club\" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a \"marketing club\".[326][327] Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract,[328] and were looking to terminate his contract.[329] On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.[330]\nRonaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1\u20130 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022.[336] On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo scored twice in a 5\u20134 loss.[337] He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\u20130 win over Al-Ettifaq,[338] and scored his first goal in a 2\u20132 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty.[339] On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4\u20130 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal.[340] On 25 February, he scored his second hat-trick for the club, helping his side to a 3\u20130 away league victory against Damac.[341] Ronaldo was awarded the Player of the Month award for February after scoring eight goals and assisting twice.[342] Ronaldo spent another season without winning a league title, as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022\u201323 season.[343]\nHe scored his first goal of the 2023\u201324 season in a 4\u20131 win over Union Monastirienne in the Arab Club Champions Cup on 31 July.[345] In the next Arab Club Champions Cup fixture on 3 August, Ronaldo scored a late equaliser against Zamalek, to help his side secure a 1\u20131 draw and qualify for the quarter-finals in second place of their group.[346] In the semi-finals on 9 August, Ronaldo scored the only goal of a win over Al-Shorta, converting a penalty to help Al Nassr reach their first ever Arab Club Champions Cup final.[347] In the final on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals for a ten-man Al Nassr as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2\u20131 after extra time to win the competition for the first time in their history. Ronaldo was awarded the competition's top scorer award having scored six goals in the competition.[348]\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his first league appearance of the season in a 2\u20130 defeat to Al-Taawoun,[349] and scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 5\u20130 away win against Al-Fateh a week later.[350] On 29 August, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted once in a 4\u20130 win against rivals Al-Shabab.[351] Ronaldo was awarded the SPL Player of the Month award for August after scoring five goals and assisting twice.[352] On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr's 5\u20131 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal.[353] On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2\u20130 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws).[354] Ronaldo received the SPL Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after recording five goals and three assists in September.[355] On 2 October, he scored his first AFC Champions League goal in the home fixture against Istiklol, the equaliser in an eventual 3\u20131 win.[356]\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.[7]\nAged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1\u20130 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003,[357] coming on as a half-time substitute for Lu\u00eds Figo.[358] He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2\u20131 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal.[358] After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals,[359] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2\u20131 win over the Netherlands.[360] He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.[361]\nRonaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals.[357] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage.[362] At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[363] In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz.[358] Following Portugal's 1\u20130 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game.[364] In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[365] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[358][366] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals.[358] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1\u20130 semi-final defeat to France.[367] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[358][368] Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.[369][370]\nRonaldo, pictured playing against Germany at Euro 2012, was made captain for Portugal in 2008.\nOne day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007,[371] as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.[371] Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.[372] While he scored eight goals in qualifications,[373] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3\u20131 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance.[374][375] Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3\u20132 loss against eventual finalists Germany.[376]\nAfter Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.[377] Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008.[378] Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup,[358] as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[379] In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[380][381][382] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7\u20130 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months.[383] Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1\u20130 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[384]\nRonaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \"group of death\".[385] In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2\u20131 win.[386] He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1\u20130 win.[387] In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match.[388][389] After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out.[390] Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot.[391] Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \"demanded\" to take the last penalty.[392] As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.[8]\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1\u20131 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap.[393] His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4\u20132 qualifying win on 6 September 2013.[394] After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, which ensured their place at the tournament.[395] His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record.[396] Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5\u20131 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.[397]\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury,[398] potentially risking his career.[399] Ronaldo later commented: \"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.\"[400] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[401] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4\u20130 defeat.[402] After assisting an injury-time 2\u20132 equaliser against the United States,[403] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2\u20131 win over Ghana.[404] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.[405] Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.[404]\nRonaldo leaps in the air in Portugal's Euro 2016 quarter-final match against Poland.\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016.[406] With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer.[407] At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half.[408] With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3\u20133 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament.[409][410] Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format,[411] despite not winning any of their games.[358]\nIn Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Suba\u0161i\u0107 into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1\u20130 win late in extra time.[358] After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty,[358] he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals;[412] he scored the opener in a 2\u20130 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals.[413] In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on,[358] he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1\u20130 victory.[414] As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.[415][416]\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2\u20133 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Est\u00e1dio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.[417]\nIn Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2\u20132 draw.[418] Three days later, he scored in a 1\u20130 win over hosts Russia.[419] On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4\u20130 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled S\u00e1ndor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s.[420][421] He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches.[422] Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3\u20130 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children,[423] and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2\u20131 after extra time.[424]\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pel\u00e9 and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals.[425] These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatovi\u0107's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose.[426] Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2\u20130 win.[427]\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3\u20133 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so.[428] On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win against Morocco, breaking Pusk\u00e1s' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals.[429] In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1\u20131 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain.[430] On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2\u20131 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16.[431] For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.[432]\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan.[433] In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\u20130.[434]\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5\u20131 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match;[435] in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals.[436] He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40,[437] while also completing his eighth international hat-trick.[438] On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2\u20131 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier.[439] On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2\u20130 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020.[440] On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2\u20130 away win over Sweden in a 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe.[441][442] On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic.[443] By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.[444]\nThe Est\u00e1dio Algarve (exterior pictured) where Ronaldo broke the international goalscoring record (surpassing the 109 goals of Iran's Ali Daei) in September 2021, among other records in the course of the same year\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3\u20130 win against Hungary in Budapest.[445] This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history.[446] He also became the first player to score at five Euros,[447] and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition,[448] and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament.[449] On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2\u20132 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals.[450] On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1\u20130 loss against Belgium in the round of 16.[451] Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.[452]\nRonaldo during a group stage game against Uruguay at the 2022 World Cup\nRonaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups.[456] In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted.[457] He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament,[458] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.[459] He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6\u20131, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gon\u00e7alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick.[460] Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint\u2013most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1\u20130, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.[461][462]\nFollowing the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.[463] On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4\u20130 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time.[464] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country.[465] On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3\u20132 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history.[466]\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[467] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[468] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[469][470] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[471] he has also been known to use the flip-flap.[472]\nRonaldo controlling the ball on his chest during a 2010\u201311 La Liga game against Almer\u00eda. At his peak, he was known for his exceptional speed and athleticism.[473]\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1\u20442 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[474][475][476] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[469][474]\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[474] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[474] An accurate penalty kick taker,[477] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bendingfree kicks.[478] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[479] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[480] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\"[481]\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[483] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[483][484][485] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[486][487][488] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \"false\", \"attacking\", or \"goalscoring winger\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[484][489] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[483][490][491] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[492][493][494]\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 or 4\u20133\u20133 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[495][496] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mand\u017euki\u0107 in a 4\u20133\u20131\u20132, 4\u20134\u20132, or 3\u20135\u20132 formation.[497][498][499] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.[496]\n\"In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player.\"\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi.[501] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[502] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[503] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[504] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[505]\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[506][507] On his longevity and \"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\"[482] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\"[508] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pel\u00e9 and Diego Maradona once retiring.[509] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[510] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[511] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[512]Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \"his relative immobility\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[513]\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \"arrogant image\" on the pitch,[514] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \"victim\" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[515] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[514] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[515] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[516][517][518]\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[519][520][521] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \"storming jump\" and \"turn\", before \"landing in spread-eagled fashion\"[520] into his \"signature power stance\",[521] while usually simultaneously exclaiming \"S\u00ed\" (Spanish and Italian for \"yes\").[519][522] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \"Sii\" in the media.[519][520][523]\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[524] It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg\u2013McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna\u2013Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[525][526] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two.[527] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[528][529][530]\n\"It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent.\"\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\"[532]Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\"[533] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\"[534] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\"[531] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Cl\u00e1sico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[535]\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \"commander\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[536] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\"[537]\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \"gone\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \"sharing the stage\".[538]\nThe Cristiano Ronaldo Museum, Museu CR7, in Funchal, Madeira. It was opened on 15 December 2013.\nAs his reputation grew from his time at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition,[539] soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games.[540][541][542][543] Ronaldo was featured as the cover star of EA Sports' FIFA video gameFIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion.[544] His \"Sii\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover.[519] He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.[545]\nWith earnings of \u20ac720 million (\u00a3615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr..[546]Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013\u201314 and $79 million in 2014\u201315.[547][548] The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes.[549] In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015\u201316.[550] He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016\u201317.[551] He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career.[552] Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012[553] and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013, with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists.[553][554] Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014.[555] He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world.[556]ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.[557][558][559][560]\nStatue of Ronaldo, in Madeira, resembles the pose he strikes before taking free kicks.[561]\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers.[562] The most-followed person on Facebook (160 million), the most-followed on Instagram (557 million) and the most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (107 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 to June 2017.[551] Ronaldo has released two mobile apps. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive,[563] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app.[564] Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.[565]\nRonaldo has been the subject of several works. His autobiography, titled Moments, was published in December 2007.[566] His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was consequently subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011.[527]Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014.[567] A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.[568][569]\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product.[570] In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt.[571] In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.[572]\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008.[573] In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013.[574] He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014.[575][576] In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \"Legacy\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.[577]\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus).[578] In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia;[579] the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team Uni\u00e3o da Madeira.[580][581] At a ceremony held at the Bel\u00e9m Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\"[582] A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.[583]\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pel\u00e9, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London.[584] Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013.[585] In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.[586]\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport.[587] The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented.[588] The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live,[589] while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque.[590][588] A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust;[591] however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.[592]\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.[595][596] After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira.[597] In 2009, Ronaldo donated \u00a3100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island.[598] In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Mar\u00edtimo and Nacional.[599]\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.[600] In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's \"11 for Health\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity.[601] In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.[602] In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.[603]\nRonaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating \u00a35 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people.[604] In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his \u20ac600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition.[604] In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.[605]\nRonaldo has five children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States.[606] He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her.[607][608] In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.[609]\nRonaldo became a father to twins,[610] born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodr\u00edguez,[611] who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017.[612] The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.[613][614]\nRonaldo's father, Jos\u00e9, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.[615]\nIn January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that \"the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract\", but Saudi authorities have begun to \"turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime\".[616]\nRonaldo is of Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother.[617] He is a Roman Catholic.[618]\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost \u20ac15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time.[621] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined \u20ac18.8 million, later reduced to \u20ac16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[622]\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[623]\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[624][625] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[624][626] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \"intentional defamation campaign\" with parts significantly \"altered and/or completely fabricated\",[627][628] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied.[629] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"[630] The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civillawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape.[631]The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought \u00a356 million in damages from Ronaldo.[632] In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\" the case, despite the documents containing \"privileged communications\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\" during the 2010 settlement with her.[633] In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \"cyber-hacked attorney-client privileged documents\" were actions representing \"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\".[631][634]\n^Real Madrid had previously recognised Ronaldo as their all-time top scorer after he scored a brace against Malm\u00f6 FF on 30 September 2015. The club's official record book attributes to Ronaldo a 74th-minute goal in a 2\u20131 win over Real Sociedad on 18 September 2010, despite his free-kick having been deflected by Pepe.[199]",

The group made over $1.1 billion combined and includes three soccer stars, three basketball players, two golfers, a boxer and a now-retired tennis player.\nHere's a look at the biggest paydays for athletes on and off the field over the last year:\nCristiano Ronaldo\u2019s ugly exit from Manchester United wound up helping his bank account. The Portuguese superstar left Europe to sign with Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr and now has an estimated annual salary of $75 million. His appeal to brands off the field is also evident, as he has more combined followers across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter than any other athlete on Earth.\nLionel Messi\u2019s PSG future is over, but coming off his first career World Cup title, the Argentine legend is still raking in dough. About half of his money came from PSG, while endorsements from Adidas, Budweiser, PepsiCo, Socios and more effectively doubled his earnings.\nNext in the 35-year-old's chapter is MLS, which he announced would be his next destination. Concrete details on his potential salary are not yet known due to MLS' financial rules, so it'll be interesting to see how much the club pays him along with possible endorsement deals.\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 is the youngest player in Forbes\u2019 top 10 at just 24 years old. With one World Cup title under his belt and another World Cup Final appearance in 2022, the PSG phenom has already become one of the world\u2019s most recognizable athletes. A majority of his earnings come from his whopping salary with the French club.\nHere are five things to know about Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, World Cup winner and forward for Paris Saint-Germain.\nLeBron James is the top-earning American athlete on Forbes\u2019 list.

Dustin Johnson joined LIV Golf in 2022 for a staggering signing fee, and wound up making $35.6 million in prize money during play in less than 10 tournaments on the rouge tour.\nRight behind Johnson is Phil Mickelson, who is relying on on-course results for earnings after losing sponsors with his move to LIV. The new golf league handed Mickelson a contract in the ballpark of $200 million to join last year. The 52-year-old lefty returned to hallowed grounds and earned $1.6 million by tying for second place at the 2023 Masters.\nSteph Curry is the eighth and final athlete to surpass the $100 million threshold over the last year. He won his fourth NBA Finals with the Golden State Warriors last June and had the league\u2019s highest 2022-23 salary at $48.1 million. Off the court, Curry was swept into a lawsuit after FTX collapsed, but he has a lucrative deal with Under Armour and is expanding his media ventures with his company, Unanimous Media, to make up for that loss.\nRoger Federer called it a career last September, but his sponsors are staying put.

This picture shows the estimated path and altitude of the meteor in red, with the possible location for the METEOSAT IR fireball (bolide) as orange crosshairs and the infrasound detection of the explosion in green\nAsteroid impact prediction is the prediction of the dates and times of asteroidsimpacting Earth, along with the locations and severities of the impacts.\nThe process of impact prediction follows three major steps:\nDiscovery of an asteroid and initial assessment of its orbit which is generally based on a short observation arc of less than 2 weeks.\nCalculating if, when and where the orbit may intersect with Earth at some point in the future.[1]\nIn addition, although not strictly part of the prediction process, once an impact has been predicted, an appropriate response needs to be made.[2]\nMost asteroids are discovered by a camera on a telescope with a wide field of view. Image differencing software compares a recent image with earlier ones of the same part of the sky, detecting objects that have moved, brightened, or appeared. Those systems usually obtain a few observations per night, which can be linked up into a very preliminary orbit determination. This predicts approximate positions over the next few nights, and follow-ups can then be carried out by any telescope powerful enough to see the newly detected object. Orbit intersection calculations are then carried out by two independent systems, one (Sentry) run by NASA and the other (NEODyS) by ESA.\nCurrent systems only detect an arriving object when several factors are just right, mainly the direction of approach relative to the Sun, the weather, and phase of the Moon. The result is a low overall rate of success (around 1%) which is worse the smaller the objects are.[note 1] A few near misses by medium-size asteroids have been predicted years in advance, with a tiny chance of actually striking Earth, and a handful of small actual impactors have successfully been detected hours in advance. All of the latter struck wilderness or ocean, and hurt no one. The majority of impacts are by small, undiscovered objects. They rarely hit a populated area, but can cause widespread damage when they do. Performance is improving in detecting smaller objects as existing systems are upgraded, and new ones come on line, but the blind spot issue which all current systems face around the Sun can only be overcome by a dedicated space based system or by discovering objects on a previous approach to Earth many years before a potential impact.\nIn 1992 a report to NASA recommended a coordinated survey (christened Spaceguard) to discover, verify and provide follow-up observations for Earth-crossing asteroids.[3] This survey was scaled to discover 90% of all objects larger than one kilometer within 25 years. Three years later, a further NASA report recommended search surveys that would discover 60\u201370% of the short-period, near-Earth objects larger than one kilometer within ten years and obtain 90% completeness within five more years.[4]\nIn 1998, NASA formally embraced the goal of finding and cataloging, by 2008, 90% of all near-Earth objects (NEOs) with diameters of 1 km or larger that could represent a collision risk to Earth. The 1 km diameter metric was chosen after considerable study indicated that an impact of an object smaller than 1 km could cause significant local or regional damage but is unlikely to cause a worldwide catastrophe.[3] The impact of an object much larger than 1 km diameter could well result in worldwide damage up to, and potentially including, extinction of the human race. The NASA commitment has resulted in the funding of a number of NEO search efforts, which made considerable progress toward the 90% goal by the target date of 2008 and also produced the first ever successful prediction of an asteroid impact (the 4-meter 2008 TC3 was detected 19 hours before impact). However, the 2009 discovery of several NEOs approximately 2 to 3 kilometers in diameter (e.g. 2009 CR2, 2009 HC82, 2009 KJ, 2009 MS and 2009 OG) demonstrated there were still large objects to be detected.\nThree years later, in 2012, the 40 meter diameter asteroid 367943 Duende was discovered and successfully predicted to be on close but non-colliding approach to Earth again just 11 months later. This was a landmark prediction as the object was only 20 m \u00d7 40 m, and it was closely monitored as a result. On the day of its closest approach and by coincidence, a smaller asteroid was also approaching Earth, unpredicted and undetected, from a direction close to the Sun. Unlike 367943 Duende it was on a collision course and it impacted Earth 16 hours before 367943 Duende passed, becoming the Chelyabinsk meteor. It injured 1,500 people and damaged over 7,000 buildings, raising the profile of the dangers of even small asteroid impacts if they occur over populated areas. The asteroid is estimated to have been 17 m across.\nThe first step in predicting impacts is detecting asteroids and determining their orbits. Finding faint near-Earth objects against the much more numerous background stars is very much a needle in a haystack search. It is achieved by sky surveys that are designed to discover near Earth asteroids. Unlike the majority of telescopes that have a narrow field of view and high magnification, survey telescopes have a wide field of view to scan the entire sky in a reasonable amount of time with enough sensitivity to pick up the faint near-Earth objects they are searching for.\nNEO focused surveys revisit the same area of sky several times in succession. Movement can then be detected using image differencing techniques. Anything that moves from image to image against the background of stars is compared to a catalogue of all known objects, and if it is not already known is reported as a new discovery along with its precise position and the observation time. This then allows other observers to confirm and add to the data about the newly discovered object.[1][14]\nAsteroid surveys can be classified as either cataloging surveys, which use larger telescopes to mostly identify larger asteroids well before they come notably close to Earth, or warning surveys, which use smaller telescopes to mostly look for smaller asteroids within several million kilometers of Earth. Cataloging systems focus on finding larger asteroids years in advance and they scan the sky slowly (of the order of once per month), but deeply. Warning systems focus on scanning the sky relatively quickly (of the order of once per night). They typically cannot detect objects that are as faint as cataloging systems but they will not miss an asteroid that dramatically brightens for just a few days when it passes very close to Earth. Some systems compromise and scan the sky approximately once per week.[citation needed]\nFor larger asteroids (> 100 m to 1 km across), prediction is based on cataloging the asteroid, years to centuries before it could impact. This technique is possible as their size makes them bright enough to be seen from a long distance. Their orbits therefore can be measured and any future impacts predicted long before they are on an impact approach to Earth. This long period of warning is important as an impact from a 1 km object would cause worldwide damage and around a decade of lead time would be needed to deflect it away from Earth. As of 2018, the inventory is nearly complete for the kilometer-size objects (around 900) which would cause global damage, and approximately one third complete for 140 meter objects (around 8500) which would cause major regional damage.[note 2][note 3][14][15][16] The effectiveness of the cataloging is somewhat limited by the fact that some proportion of the objects have been lost since their discovery, due to insufficient observations to accurately determine their orbits.\nSmaller near-Earth objects number into millions and therefore impact Earth much more often, though obviously with much less damage. The vast majority remain undiscovered.[16] They seldom pass close enough to Earth that they become bright enough to observe, and so most can only be observed when within a few million kilometers of Earth. They therefore cannot usually be cataloged well in advance and can only be warned about, a few weeks to days in advance.\nCurrent mechanisms for detecting asteroids on approach rely on ground based telescopes with wide fields of view. Those currently can monitor the sky at most every second night, and therefore miss most of the smaller asteroids which are bright enough to detect for less than two days. Such very small asteroids much more commonly impact Earth than larger ones, but they make little damage. Missing them therefore has limited consequences. Much more importantly, ground-based telescopes are blind to most of the asteroids which impact the day side of the planet and will miss even large ones. These and other problems mean very few impacts are successfully predicted (see \u00a7Effectiveness of the current system and \u00a7Improving impact prediction).[14]\nAsteroids detected by warning systems are much too close to their time of potential impact to deflect them away from Earth, but there is still enough time to mitigate the consequences of the impact by evacuating and otherwise preparing the affected area. Warning systems can also detect asteroids which have been successfully catalogued as existing, but whose orbit was insufficiently well determined to allow a prediction of where they are now.\nThe main NEO focussed surveys are listed below, along with future telescopes that are already funded.\nLocations of the major near Earth asteroid surveys. The addition of Kiso, SST and the Southern ATLAS locations mean the surveys are no longer solely clustered in the north west of the globe\nOriginally all the surveys were clustered together in a relatively small part of the Northern Hemisphere. This meant that around 15% of the sky at extreme Southern declination was never monitored,[17] and that the rest of the Southern sky was observed over a shorter season than the Northern sky. Moreover, as the hours of darkness are fewer in summertime, the lack of a balance of surveys between North and South meant that the sky was scanned less often in the Northern summer. The ATLAS telescopes now operating at the South African Astronomical Observatory and El Sauce observatory in Chile now cover this gap in the south east of the globe.[18][17] Once it is completed, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will improve the existing cover of the southern sky. The 3.5 m Space Surveillance Telescope, which was originally also in the southwest United States, was dismantled and moved to Western Australia in 2017. When completed, this should also improve the global coverage. Construction has been delayed due to the new site being in a cyclone region, but was completed in September 2022.[19][20]\nATLAS, the \"Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\" uses four 0.5-metre telescopes. Two are located on the Hawaiian Islands, at Haleakala and Mauna Loa, one at the South African Astronomical Observatory, and one in Chile.[18][28][22] With a field of view of 30 square degrees each, the telescopes survey the observable sky down to apparent magnitude 19 with 4 exposures every night.[29][30] The survey has been operational with the two Hawaii telescopes since 2017, and in 2018 obtained NASA funding for two additional telescopes sited in the Southern hemisphere. They were expected to take 18 months to build.[31] Their southern locations provide coverage of the 15% of the sky that cannot be observed from Hawaii, and combined with the Northern hemisphere telescopes give non-stop coverage of the equatorial night sky (the South African location is not only in the opposite hemisphere to Hawaii, but also at an opposing longitude).[28] The full ATLAS concept consists of eight of its 50-centimeter diameter f/2 Wright-Schmidt telescopes, spread over the globe for 24h/24h coverage of the full-night-sky.\nIn 1998, the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) took over from Spacewatch in surveying the sky for the University of Arizona. It uses two telescopes, a 1.5 m Cassegrain reflector telescope on the peak of Mount Lemmon (also known as a survey in its own right, the Mount Lemmon Survey), and a 0.7 m Schmidt telescope near Mount Bigelow (both in the Tucson, Arizona area in the south west of the United States). Both sites use identical cameras which provide a field of view of 5 square degrees on the 1.5 m telescope and 19 square degrees on the Catalina Schmidt. The Cassegrain reflector telescope takes three to four weeks to survey the entire sky, detecting objects fainter than apparent magnitude 21.5. The 0.7 m telescope takes a week to complete a survey of the sky, detecting objects fainter than apparent magnitude 19.[32] This combination of telescopes, one slow and one medium, has so far detected more near Earth Objects than any other single survey. This shows the need for a combination of different types of telescopes.\nCSS used to include a telescope in the Southern Hemisphere, the Siding Spring Survey. However operations ended in 2013 after funding was discontinued.[33]\nThe Kiso Observatory uses a 1.05m Schmidt telescope on Mt. Ontake near Tokyo in Japan.[34] In late 2019 the Kiso Observatory added a new instrument to the telescope, \"Tomo-e Gozen\", designed to detect fast moving and rapidly changing objects. It has a wide field of view (20 square degrees) and scans the sky in just 2 hours, far faster than any other survey as of 2021.[35][36] This puts it squarely in the warning survey category. In order to scan the sky so quickly, the camera captures 2 frames per second, which means the sensitivity is lower than other metre class telescopes (which have much longer exposure times), giving a limiting magnitude of just 18.[37][38] However, despite not being able to see dimmer objects which are detectable by other surveys, the ability to scan the entire sky several times per night allows it to spot fast moving asteroids that other surveys miss. It has discovered a significant number of near-Earth asteroids as a result (for example see List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2021).\nThe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a wide-field survey reflecting telescope with an 8.4 meter primary mirror, currently under construction on Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile. It will survey the entire available sky around every three nights. Science operations are due to begin in 2022.[39] Scanning the sky relatively fast but also being able to detect objects down to apparent magnitude 27, it should be good at detecting nearby fast moving objects as well as excellent for larger slower objects that are currently further away.\nA planned space-based 0.5m infrared telescope designed to survey the Solar System for potentially hazardous asteroids.[40] The telescope will use a passive cooling system, and so unlike its predecessor NEOWISE, it will not suffer from a performance degradation due to running out of coolant. It does still have a limited mission duration however as it needs to use propellant for orbital station keeping in order to maintain its position at SEL1. From here, the mission will search for asteroids hidden from Earth based satellites by the Sun's glare. It is planned for launch in 2026.[23][24]\nThe Near Earth Object Survey TELescope (NEOSTEL) is an ESA funded project, starting with an initial prototype currently under construction. The telescope is of a new \"fly-eye\" design that combines a single reflector with multiple sets of optics and CCDs, giving a very wide field of view (around 45 square degrees). When complete it will have the widest field of view of any telescope and will be able to survey the majority of the visible sky in a single night. If the initial prototype is successful, three more telescopes are planned for installation around the globe. Because of the novel design, the size of the primary mirror is not directly comparable to more conventional telescopes, but is equivalent to a conventional 1\u2013metre telescope.[41][42]\nThe telescope itself should be complete by end of 2019, and installation on Mount Mufara, Sicily should be complete in 2020 but was pushed back to 2022.[25][41][43]\nViewed from space by WISE using a thermal camera, asteroid 2010 AB78 appears redder than the background stars as it emits most of its light at longer infrared wavelengths. In visible light it is very faint and difficult to see.\nThe Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer is a 0.4 m infrared-wavelengthspace telescope launched in December 2009,[44][45][46] and placed in hibernation in February 2011.[47] It was re-activated in 2013 specifically to search for near-Earth objects under the NEOWISE mission.[48] By this stage, the spacecraft's cryogenic coolant had been depleted and so only two of the spacecraft's four sensors could be used. Whilst this has still led to new discoveries of asteroids not previously seen from ground-based telescopes, the productivity has dropped significantly. In its peak year when all four sensors were operational, WISE made 2.28 million asteroid observations. In recent years, with no cryogen, NEOWISE typically makes approximately 0.15 million asteroid observations annually.[21] The next generation of infrared space telescopes has been designed so that they do not need cryogenic cooling.[49]\nThe Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) is a 3.5 m telescope that detects, tracks, and can discern small, obscure objects, in deep space with a wide field of view system. The SST mount uses an advanced servo-control technology, that makes it one of the quickest and most agile telescopes of its size.[54][55] It has a field of view of 6 square degrees and can scan the visible sky in 6 clear nights down to apparent magnitude 20.5. Its primary mission is tracking orbital debris. This task is similar to that of spotting near-Earth asteroids and so it is capable of both.[56]\nSpacewatch was an early sky survey focussed on finding near Earth asteroids, founded in 1980. It was the first to use CCDimage sensors to search for them, and the first to develop software to detect moving objects automatically in real-time. This led to a huge increase in productivity. Before 1990 a few hundred observations were made each year. After automation, annual productivity jumped by a factor of 100 leading to tens of thousands of observations per year. This paved the way for the surveys we have today.[27]\nAlthough the survey is still in operation, in 1998 it was superseded by Catalina Sky Survey. Since then it has focused on following up on discoveries by other surveys, rather than making new discoveries itself. In particular it aims to prevent high priority PHOs from being lost after their discovery. The survey telescopes are 1.8 m and 0.9 m. The two follow-up telescopes are 2.3 m and 4 m.[27]\nThe orbits of kilometre class NEAs are generally well known as there are usually many follow-up observations. Large numbers of smaller NEAs however have highly uncertain orbits due to insufficient follow-up after discovery. Many have been lost. [62]\nOnce a new asteroid has been discovered and reported, other observers can confirm the finding and help define the orbit of the newly discovered object. The International Astronomical UnionMinor Planet Center (MPC) acts as the global clearing house for information on asteroid orbits. It publishes lists of new discoveries that need verifying and still have uncertain orbits, and it collects the resulting follow-up observations from around the world. Unlike the initial discovery, which typically requires unusual and expensive wide-field telescopes, ordinary telescopes can be used to confirm the object as its position is now approximately known. There are far more of these around the globe, and even a well equipped amateur astronomer can contribute valuable follow-up observations of moderately bright asteroids. For example, the Great Shefford Observatory in the back garden of amateur Peter Birtwhistle typically submits thousands of observations to the Minor Planet Center every year.[63][21] Nonetheless, some surveys (for example CSS and Spacewatch) have their own dedicated follow-up telescopes.[27]\nFollow-up observations are important because once a sky survey has reported a discovery it may not return to observe the object again for days or weeks. By this time it may be too faint for it to detect, and in danger of becoming a lost asteroid. The more observations and the longer the observation arc, the greater the accuracy of the orbit model. This is important for two reasons:\nfor imminent impacts it helps to make a better prediction of where the impact will occur and whether there is any danger of hitting a populated area.\nfor asteroids that will miss Earth this time round, the more accurate the orbit model is, the further into the future its position can be predicted. This allows recovery of the asteroid on its subsequent approaches, and impacts to be predicted years in advance.[14]\nAssessing the size of the asteroid is important for predicting the severity of the impact, and therefore the actions that need to be taken (if any). With just observations of reflected visible light by a conventional telescope, the object could be anything from 50% to 200% of the estimated diameter, and therefore anything from one-eighth to eight times the estimated volume and mass.[64] Because of this, one key follow-up observation is to measure the asteroid in the thermal infrared spectrum (long-wavelength infrared), using an infrared telescope. The amount of thermal radiation given off by an asteroid together with the amount of reflected visible light allows a much more accurate assessment of its size than just how bright it appears in the visible spectrum. Jointly using thermal infrared and visible measurements, a thermal model of the asteroid can estimate its size to within about 10% of the true size.\nOne example of such a follow-up observation was for 3671 Dionysus by UKIRT, the world's largest infrared telescope at the time (1997).[65] A second example was the 2013 ESA Herschel Space Observatory follow-up observations of 99942 Apophis, which showed it was 20% larger and 75% more massive than previously estimated.[66] However such follow-ups are rare. The size estimates of most near-Earth asteroids are based on visible light only.[67]\nIf the object was discovered by an infrared survey telescope initially, then an accurate size estimate will become available with visible light follow-up, and infrared follow-up will not be needed. However none of the ground-based survey telescopes listed above operate at thermal infrared wavelengths. The NEOWISE satellite had two thermal infrared sensors but they stopped working when the cryogen ran out. There are therefore currently no active thermal infrared sky surveys which are focused on discovering near-Earth objects. There are plans for a new space based thermal infrared survey telescope, Near-Earth Object Surveillance Mission, due to launch in 2025.\nThe minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) between an asteroid and the Earth is the distance between the closest points of their orbits. This first check is a coarse measure that does not allow an impact prediction to be made, but is based solely on the orbit parameters and gives an initial measure of how close to Earth the asteroid could come. If the MOID is large then the two objects never come near each other. In this case, unless the orbit of the asteroid is perturbed so that the MOID is reduced at some point in the future, it will never impact Earth and can be ignored. However, if the MOID is small then it is necessary to carry out more detailed calculations to determine if an impact will happen in the future. Asteroids with a MOID of less than 0.05 AU and an absolute magnitude brighter than 22 are categorized as a potentially hazardous asteroid.[68]\nOrbit and positions of 2018 LA and Earth, 30 days before impact. The diagram shows how orbit data can be used to predict impacts well in advance. This particular asteroid's orbit was only known a few hours before impact. The diagram was made later.\nOnce the initial orbit is known, the potential positions can be forecast years into the future and compared to the future position of Earth. If the distance between the asteroid and the centre of the Earth is less than Earth radius then a potential impact is predicted. To take account of the uncertainties in the orbit of the asteroid, many future projections are made (simulations) with slightly different parameters within the range of the uncertainty. This allows a percentage chance of impact to be estimated. For example, if 1,000 simulations are carried out and 73 result in an impact, then the prediction would be a 7.3% chance of impact.[69]\nNEODyS (Near Earth Objects Dynamic Site) is a European Space Agency service that provides information on near Earth objects. It is based on a continually and (almost) automatically maintained database of near Earth asteroid orbits. The site provides a number of services to the NEO community. The main service is an impact monitoring system (CLOMON2) of all near-Earth asteroids covering a period until the year 2100.[70]\nThe NEODyS website includes a Risk Page where all NEOs with probabilities of hitting the Earth greater than 10\u221211 from now until 2100 are shown in a risk list. In the table of the risk list the NEOs are divided into:\n\"observable\", objects which are presently observable and which critically need a follow-up in order to improve their orbit\n\"possible recovery\", objects which are not visible at present, but which are possible to recover in the near future\n\"lost\", objects which have an absolute magnitude (H) brighter than 25 but which are virtually lost, their orbit being too uncertain; and\n\"small\", objects with an absolute magnitude fainter than 25; even when those are \"lost\", they are considered too small to result in heavy damage on the ground (though the Chelyabinsk meteor would have been fainter than this).\nEach object has its own impactor table (IT) which shows many parameters useful to determine the risk assessment.[71]\nNASA's Sentry System continually scans the MPC catalog of known asteroids, analyzing their orbits for any possible future impacts.[1] Like ESA's NEODyS, it gives a list of possible future impacts, along with the probability of each. It uses a slightly different algorithm to NEODyS, and so provides a useful cross-check and corroboration.\nCurrently, no impacts are predicted (the single highest probability impact currently listed is ~7 m asteroid 2010 RF12, which is due to pass Earth in September 2095 with only a 10% predicted chance of impacting; its size is also small enough that any damage from an impact would be minimal).[72][73]\nThe ellipses in the diagram on the right show the predicted position of an example asteroid at closest Earth approach. At first, with only a few asteroid observations, the error ellipse is very large and includes the Earth. The impact prediction is small because the Earth cover a small fraction or the error ellipse. (Often times the error ellipse extends for tens if not hundreds of millions of km.) Further observations shrink the error ellipse. If it still includes the Earth, this raises the predicted impact probability, since the Earth now covers a larger fraction of the error region. Finally, yet more observations (often radar observations, or discovery of a previous sighting of the same asteroid on much older archival images) shrink the ellipse, usually revealing that the Earth is outside the smaller error region and the impact probability is then near zero.[74] In rare cases, the Earth remains in the ever shrinking error ellipse and the impact probability then approaches one.\nFor asteroids that are actually on track to hit Earth, the predicted probability of impact never stops increasing as more observations are made. This initially very similar pattern makes it difficult to quickly differentiate between asteroids which will be millions of kilometres from Earth and those which will actually hit it. This in turn makes it difficult to decide when to raise an alarm as gaining more certainty takes time, which reduces the time available to react to a predicted impact. However raising the alarm too soon has the danger of causing a false alarm and creating a Boy Who Cried Wolf effect if the asteroid in fact misses Earth. NASA will raise an alert if an asteroid has a better than 1% chance of impacting.\nIn December 2004 when Apophis was estimated to have a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth on 13 April 2029, the uncertainty region for this asteroid had shrunk to 82,818 km.[75]\nOnce an impact has been predicted the potential severity needs to be assessed, and a response plan formed.[2] Depending on the time to impact and the predicted severity this may be as simple as giving a warning to citizens. For example, although unpredicted, the 2013\nimpact at Chelyabinsk was spotted through the window by teacher Yulia Karbysheva. She thought it prudent to take precautionary measures by ordering her students to stay away from the room's windows and to perform a duck and cover maneuver. The teacher, who remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the blast arrived and window glass severed a tendon in one of her arms and left thigh, but none of her students, whom she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered lacerations.[76][77] If the impact had been predicted and a warning had been given to the entire population, similar simple precautionary actions could have vastly reduced the number of injuries. Children who were in other classes were injured.[78]\nIf a more severe impact is predicted, the response may require evacuation of the area, or with sufficient lead time available, an avoidance mission to repel the asteroid. According to expert testimony in the United States Congress in 2013, NASA would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched which was demonstrated by kinetically deflecting a minor planet moon, non-hazardous NEO Asteroid called Dimorphos with the help of the DART spacecraft.[79] Following a ten-month journey to the Didymos system, the impactor collided with Dimorphos on 26 September 2022 at a speed of around 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kilometres per hour).[80][81] The collision successfully decreased Dimorphos's orbital period around Didymos by 32\u00b12 minutes.[82][83][84][85]\nOne problem with assessing effectiveness this way is that the sensitivity of infrasound sensors extends to small asteroids, which generally do very little damage. The missed asteroids do tend to be small, and missing small asteroids is relatively unimportant. By contrast, missing a large day-side impacting asteroid is highly problematic, with the unpredicted mid-size Chelyabinsk meteor providing a mild real-life example. In order to assess the effectiveness for detecting the (rare) larger asteroids which do matter, a different approach is needed.\nThat effectiveness for larger asteroid can be assessed by looking at warning times for asteroids which did not impact Earth but came close. The below diagram for asteroids which came closer than the Moon shows how far in advance of closest approach they were first detected. Unlike actual asteroid impacts, where infrasound sensors provide ground truth, it is impossible to know for sure how many close approaches were undetected. The below chart therefore and by construction excludes any asteroids which went completely undetected. Of the asteroids that were detected, the diagram shows that about half were not detected until after they had passed Earth. If they had been on an impact trajectory, they would have been undetected before impact, primarily because they approached from a direction close to the Sun. This includes larger asteroids such as 2018 AH, which approached from a direction close to the Sun and wasn't detected until 2 days after it had passed. It is estimated to be around 100 times more massive than the Chelyabinsk meteor.\nIt is worth noting that the number of detections is increasing as more survey sites come on line (for example ATLAS in 2016 and ZTF in 2018), but that approximately half of the detections are invariably made after the asteroid passes the Earth. The below charts visualise the warning times of the close approaches listed in the above bargraph, by the size of the asteroid instead of by the year they occurred in. The sizes of the charts show the relative sizes of the asteroids to scale. This is based the absolute magnitude of each asteroid, an approximate measure of size based on brightness. For comparison, the approximate size of a person is also shown.\nAs can be seen, the ability to predict larger asteroids has significantly improved since the early years of the 21st century, with some now being catalogued (predicted more than 1 year in advance), or having usable early warning times (greater than a week).\nOne final statistic which casts some light on the effectiveness of the current system is the average warning time for an asteroid impact. Based on the few successfully predicted asteroid impacts, the average time between initial detection and impact is currently around 4 hours. There is however some delay between the initial observation of the asteroid, data submission, and the follow-up observations and calculations which lead to an impact prediction being made.\nIn addition to the already-funded telescopes mentioned above, two separate approaches have been suggested by NASA to improve impact prediction. Both approaches focus on the first step in impact prediction (discovering near-Earth asteroids) as this is the largest weakness in the current system. The first approach uses more powerful ground-based telescopes similar to the LSST.[87] Being ground-based, such telescopes will still only observe part of the sky around Earth. In particular, all ground-based telescopes have a large blind spot for any asteroids coming from the direction of the Sun.[14] In addition, they are affected by weather conditions, airglow and the phase of the Moon.\nGround based telescopes can only detect objects approaching on the night-side of the planet, away from the Sun. Roughly half of impacts occur on the day-side of the planet.\nTo get around all of these issues, the second approach suggested is the use of space-based telescopes which can observe a much larger region of the sky around Earth. Although they still cannot point directly towards the Sun, they do not have the problem of blue sky to overcome and so can detect asteroids much closer in the sky to the Sun than ground-based telescopes.[73] Unaffected by weather or airglow they can also operate 24 hours per day all year round. Finally, telescopes in space have the advantage of being able to use infrared sensors without the interference of the Earth's atmosphere. These sensors are better for detecting asteroids than optical sensors, and although there are some ground based infrared telescopes such as UKIRT,[88] they are not designed for detecting asteroids. Space-based telescopes are more expensive, however, and tend to have a shorter lifespan. Therefore, Earth-based and space-based technologies complement each other to an extent.[14] Although the majority of the IR spectrum is blocked by Earth's atmosphere, the very useful thermal (long-wavelength infrared) frequency band is not blocked (see gap at 10 \u03bcm in the diagram below). This allows for the possibility of ground based thermal imaging surveys designed for detecting near earth asteroids, though none are currently planned.\nThere is a further issue that even telescopes in Earth orbit do not overcome (unless they operate in the thermal infrared spectrum). This is the issue of illumination. Asteroids go through phases similar to the lunar phases. Even though a telescope in orbit may have an unobstructed view of an object that is close in the sky to the Sun, it will still be looking at the dark side of the object. This is because the Sun is shining primarily on the side facing away from the Earth, as is the case with the Moon when it is in a new moon phase. Because of this opposition effect, objects are far less bright in these phases than when fully illuminated, which makes them difficult to detect (see chart and diagram below).\nThis problem can be solved by the use of thermal infrared surveys (either ground based or space based). Ordinary telescopes depend on observing light reflected from the Sun, which is why the opposition effect occurs. Telescopes which detect thermal infrared light depend only on the temperature of the object. Its thermal glow can be detected from any angle, and is particularly useful for differentiating asteroids from the background stars, which have a different thermal signature.[64]\nThis problem can also be solved without using thermal infrared, by positioning a space telescope away from Earth, closer to the Sun. The telescope can then look back towards Earth from the same direction as the Sun, and any asteroids closer to Earth than the telescope will then be in opposition, and much better illuminated. There is a point between the Earth and Sun where the gravities of the two bodies are perfectly in balance, called the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point (SEL1). It is approximately 1.6 million kilometres (1 million miles) from Earth, about four times as far away as the Moon, and is ideally suited for placing such a space telescope.[14] One problem with this position is Earth glare. Looking outward from SEL1, Earth itself is at full brightness, which prevents a telescope situated there from seeing that area of sky. Fortunately, this is the same area of sky that ground-based telescopes are best at spotting asteroids in, so the two complement each other.\nAnother possible position for a space telescope would be even closer to the Sun, for example in a Venus-like orbit. This would give a wider view of Earth orbit, but at a greater distance. Unlike a telescope at the SEL1 Lagrange point, it would not stay in sync with Earth but would orbit the Sun at a similar rate to Venus. Because of this, it would not often be in a position to provide any warning of asteroids shortly before impact, but it would be in a good position to catalog objects before they are on final approach, especially those which primarily orbit closer to the Sun.[14] One issue with being as close to the Sun as Venus is that the craft may be too warm to use infrared wavelengths. A second issue would be communications. As the telescope will be a long way from Earth for most of the year (and even behind the Sun at some points) communication would often be slow and at times impossible, without expensive improvements to the Deep Space Network.[14]\nIn 2017, NASA proposed a number of alternative solutions to detect 90% of near-Earth objects of size 140 m or larger over the next few decades. As the detection sensitivity drops off with size but does not cut off, this will also improve the detection rates for the smaller objects which impact Earth much more often. Several of the proposals use a combination of an improved ground-based telescope and a space-based telescope positioned at the SEL1 Lagrange point.[14][2][73] A number of large ground based telescopes are already in the late stages of construction (see above). A space based mission situated at SEL1, NEOSM has now also been funded. It is planned for launch in 2026.[23][24]\nBelow is the list of all near-Earth objects which have or may have impacted the Earth and which were predicted beforehand.[89] This list would also include any objects identified as having greater than 50% chance of impacting in the future, but no such future impacts are predicted at this time.[90] As asteroid detection ability increases it is expected that prediction will become more successful in the future.\nIn addition to these objects, the meteoroid CNEOS20200918 was found in 2022 in archival ATLAS data, imaged 10 minutes before its 2020/09/18 impact. Although it technically could have been discovered before impact, it was only noticed in retrospect.[97]\n^Smaller asteroids which are only bright enough to observe briefly. Larger asteroids are visible for long enough to overcome the more temporary conditions that prevent observation such as bad weather or a bright moon in the sky, however close proximity to the Sun in the sky can prevent all sizes of asteroid from being discovered. This is particularly true for Aten asteroids, which spend the majority of their time closer to the Sun than Earth and are therefore difficult to detect without a space based system orbiting inside of Earth's orbit.\n^Incompleteness refers to the fraction of undiscovered asteroids, not the amount of time remaining to achieve completeness. The asteroids remaining to be discovered are the ones which are hardest to find.\n^The exact percentage of objects discovered is uncertain but is estimated using statistical techniques. 2018 estimates for objects at least 1 km in size put the figure somewhere between 89% and 99%, with an expected value of 94%. This matches the figure from a 2017 NASA report which was estimated independently using a different technique\n^Because of daylight telescopes cannot see the portion of the sky around the Sun and because the Earth is in the way can only see so far North and South of the latitude that they are positioned at. The time given is the time it takes for a survey to complete coverage of the part of the sky that it can see from where it is located, assuming good weather.\n^The limiting magnitude indicates how bright an object needs to be before the telescope can detect it, larger numbers are better (fainter objects can be detected).\n^Around the time of the full Moon, the Moon is so bright that it lights up the atmosphere making faint objects impossible to see for several days per month\n^This refers to the opposition effect as seen from Earth, the fact that objects outside of the narrow cone centered on Earth are much fainter and harder to spot without using thermal infrared (see diagram above)\n^Use of thermal infrared allows objects to be seen at all angles as detection doesn't depend on reflected sunlight. It also allows an accurate size estimate of the object which is important for predicting the severity of an impact.\n^Although many IR wavelengths are blocked by the atmosphere, there is a window from 8 \u03bcm to 14 \u03bcm that allows detection of IR at useful wavelengths such as 12 \u03bcm. A 12 \u03bcm sensor was used by WISE to detect asteroids during its space based mission. Although some ground based IR surveys exist which can detect 12 \u03bcm (such as UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey), none are designed to detect moving objects such as asteroids.\n^ abTelescopes in Earth orbit are affected to an extent by the glow of the moon, but not in the same way as ground based telescopes where the light from the moon is scattered across the sky by the atmosphere\n^ abTelescopes at SEL1 are primarily affected by the glare of the Earth rather than the Moon, but not in the same way as ground based telescopes where the light from the moon is scattered across the sky by the atmosphere\n^Telescopes in a Venus-like orbit have no problems with atmosphere but being closer to the Sun, may be too warm to effectively use thermal infrared sensors. This problem could be overcome by using cryogenic coolant but this increases cost and gives the telescope a limited lifespan due to the coolant running out\n^The listed warning period is the time between the first observation and the impact. The time between the first impact prediction and the impact is necessarily shorter, and some of the impacts were actually predicted after they occurred.\n^There are two main strategies for predicting asteroid impacts with Earth, the Cataloging Strategy and the Warning Strategy. The Cataloging Strategy aims to detect all near Earth objects which could at some point in the future impact Earth. Accurate orbit predictions are made which can then anticipate any future impact years in advance. The larger and therefore most dangerous objects are amenable to this strategy as they can be observed from a sufficient distance. The more numerous but less dangerous smaller objects cannot so easily be detected this way as they are fainter and cannot be seen until they are relatively close by. The Warning Strategy aims to detect impactors months or days before they reach Earth (NASA 2017 Update on Enhancing the Search and Characterization of Near Earth Objects)\n^2014 AA exploded over the mid-Atlantic, far from the nearest infrasound detectors. Although some detections were made, reliable figures are not known\n^an object with the temporary designation A106fgF was discovered by the ATLAS survey and only has an observation arc of 39 minutes. Using the observation arc, it was only possible to estimate a 9% chance of impact between the South Atlantic, southern Africa, the Indian ocean, Indonesia, or the Pacific ocean. Whether the asteroid did impact Earth or not remains uncertain due to its small size and since much of the potential impact area is at sea or sparsely populated.\n^2018 LA was estimated to have an 82% chance of impacting Earth somewhere between the central Pacific ocean and Africa (Impact pathArchived 13 June 2018 at the Wayback Machine). Several reports from South Africa and Botswana confirmed that it did indeed impact in South-central Africa and additional observations that came in after the impact post-predicted a consistent impact location.\n^\"Why we have Asteroid \"Scares\"\".

        "context": "\nThe FIBA Men's World Ranking are FIBA's rankings of national basketball teams. FIBA ranks both men's and women's national teams for both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all mixed-sex competitions.\nOnly FIBA tournaments consisting of full five-a-side teams are used in calculations for the rankings. Other tournaments, such as regional championships, invitationals, three-on-three half-court basketball, and friendlies are not included.[2]\nOn October 11, 2017, FIBA radically changed its ranking system for men's national teams when Nike became FIBA's strategic partner. The changes saw the ranking system switching from the previous competition-based system to a game-based system.[3][4] Every game played by a national team within the last eight years in the World Cup, Olympics, continental championships, and qualifiers for these events is included in the calculations.[5] In addition to the qualifying rounds, results of the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries are also included.[citation needed]\nUntil the 2016 Olympic Games, the Olympics and the men's world championship gave 5 points each toward the ranking. Since the new FIBA ranking system was launched, these two tournaments had their score devalued to 2.5 points for playing in a World championship, and 2 points for playing in an Olympic game since 2017.\nAccording to the new system, both tournaments will not grant a differential score with respect to other tournaments of national teams, as opposed to the past where there was no difference in points in the ranking for being world champion or Olympic champion, but if there was much difference until 2016 in FIBA ranking points between these two tournaments and the rest of the competitions in FIBA, such as the continental tournaments. For women, FIBA will maintain the score of 5 points for playing an Olympic or world championship game.[citation needed][incomprehensible]\nEach game in a ranking tournament is initially valued at 1,000 \"basis points\", divided between the two teams as follows:[5]\nVictory margin\nPoints to winner\nPoints to loser\nLess than 10 points\n600\n400\n10\u201319 points\n700\n300\n20 or more points\n800\n200\nForfeit\n800\n0\nThe basis points are adjusted based on the site of the game, with FIBA calling this adjustment \"home\" and \"away\" points. During the finals of ranking tournaments, only games played by a host team in its own country count as \"home\" games; all others are treated as neutral-site games. Adjustments are:[5]\nHome game: \u221270 points\nNeutral site: no adjustment\nAway game: +70 points\nThe basis points are also adjusted to reflect the strength of the opponent. FIBA determines what it calls \"opposition ranking points\" by the following formula:[5]\nIn a new feature, a \"time decay\" factor has been introduced into the calculations. More-recent games carry the greatest weight, steadily declining until falling out of the calculations after 8 years:[5]\nFIBA uses a weighted arithmetic mean (with a minimum divisor which is not published[6]) to determine the statistical weight of each tournament. Each event is assigned a point weight that is based partly on how competitive the tournament is and partly on which national teams are participating.[2]\nFrom 2017 forward, FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania members compete for a single regional championship under the FIBA Asia banner. Results from the 2010\u20132016 period, during which FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania held separate championships, will continue to figure into the rankings (until 2025 via \"time decay\").[5]\nIn a new feature, FIBA also weights game results by the \"competition stage\".[5]\nStage\nWeight\nPre-qualifier\n0.25\nQualifier\n0.5\nFinal tournament\n1.0\nAdditionally, FIBA has added a \"round weighting\" to the system, giving each game in a final tournament (World Cup, Olympics, or continental championship) a weighting based on the round in which it takes place. Qualifying matches for these tournaments implicitly carry a round weighting of 1.0.[5]\nRound\nWeight\nGroup stage\n1.0\nRound of 16\n1.25\nQuarterfinals\n1.5\nSemifinals\n1.75\nFinal\n2.0\nIf a competition does not have a round of 16 and/or a quarterfinal round, the results from the rounds that are held are scaled according to the number of rounds, with the group stage remaining at a 1.0 weighting and the competition final remaining at 2.0.\nFIBA still uses the competition-based system to determine its women's rankings. As noted above, this system was also used to determine men's rankings prior to 2017. FIBA introduced a game-based ranking procedure similar to that currently used for men's rankings in the indeterminate future in November 2019.[7]",

        "context": "\nThe oldest preserved record of the Croatian ethnonym's native variation *x\u044arvat\u044a is of the variable stem, attested in the Ba\u0161ka tablet in style zv\u044an\u044amir\u044a kral\u044a xr\u044avat\u044ask\u044a (\"Zvonimir, Croatian king\"),[19] while the Latin variation Croatorum is archaeologically confirmed on a church inscription found in Bija\u0107i near Trogir dated to the end of the 8th or early 9th century.[20] The presumably oldest stone inscription with fully preserved ethnonym is the 9th-century Branimir inscription found near Benkovac, where Duke Branimir is styled Dux Cruatorvm, likely dated between 879 and 892, during his rule.[21] The Latin term Chroatorum is attributed to a charter of Duke Trpimir I of Croatia, dated to 852 in a 1568 copy of a lost original, but it is not certain if the original was indeed older than the Branimir inscription.[22][23]\nDuring the 5th century, the last de jure Western Roman EmperorJulius Nepos ruled a small realm from the palace after fleeing Italy in 475.[32] The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the late 6th and first half of the 7th century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands, and mountains. The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.[33]\nAccording to Constantine VII the Christianisation of Croats began in the 7th century, but the claim is disputed, and generally, Christianisation is associated with the 9th century.[45] It is assumed that initially encompassed only the elite and related people.[46] The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav,[47] or his successor Trpimir I.[48] The native Croatian royal dynasty was founded by duke Trpimir I in the mid 9th century, who defeated the Byzantine and Bulgarian forces.[49]\nFollowing the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories in 1538. The military territories became known as the Croatian Military Frontier and were under direct Habsburg control. Ottoman advances in Croatia continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak, the first decisive Ottoman defeat, when borders stabilised.[55] During the Great Turkish War (1683\u20131698), Slavonia was regained, but western Bosnia, which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control.[55] The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. Dalmatia, the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars.[56]\nThe political situation deteriorated further as Radi\u0107 was assassinated in the National Assembly in 1928, leading to King Alexander I to establish a dictatorship in January 1929.[70] The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitary constitution.[71] The HSS, now led by Vladko Ma\u010dek, continued to advocate federalisation, resulting in the Cvetkovi\u0107\u2013Ma\u010dek Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia. The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban.[72]\nA resistance movement emerged. On 22 June 1941,[83] the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak, the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Europe.[84] That sparked the beginning of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, a communist, multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito.[85] In ethnic terms, Croats were the second-largest contributors to the Partisan movement after Serbs.[86] In per capita terms, Croats contributed proportionately to their population within Yugoslavia.[87] By May 1944 (according to Tito), Croats made up 30% of the Partisan's ethnic composition, despite making up 22% of the population.[86] The movement grew fast, and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943, the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.[88]\nCardinal Aloysius Stepinac with the Croatian communist leader Vladimir Bakari\u0107 at the celebration of May Day, shortly before Stepinac was arrested and convicted by the communists, he became a symbol of resistance to the communist regime in Yugoslavia.\nBased on the studies on wartime and post-war casualties by demographer Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107 and statistician Bogoljub Ko\u010dovi\u0107, a total of 295,000 people from the territory (not including territories ceded from Italy after the war) died, which amounted to 7.3% of the population,[93] among whom were 125\u2013137,000 Serbs, 118\u2013124,000 Croats, 16\u201317,000 Jews, and 15,000 Roma.[94][95] In addition, from areas joined to Croatia after the war, a total of 32,000 people died, among whom 16,000 were Italians and 15,000 were Croats.[96] Approximately 200,000 Croats from the entirety of Yugoslavia (including Croatia) and abroad were killed in total throughout the war and its immediate aftermath, approximately 5.4% of the population.[97][98]\nThe declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and redistribution of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership.[100] Still, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.[101]\nBy the end of 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia's control to about two-thirds of its territory.[111][112] Serb paramilitary groups then began a campaign of killing, terror, and expulsion of the Croats in the rebel territories, killing thousands[113] of Croat civilians and expelling or displacing as many as 400,000 Croats and other non-Serbs from their homes.[114] Serbs living in Croatian towns, especially those near the front lines, were subjected to various forms of discrimination.[115] Croatian Serbs in Eastern and Western Slavonia and parts of the Krajina were forced to flee or were expelled by Croatian forces, though on a restricted scale and in lesser numbers.[116] The Croatian Government publicly deplored these practices and sought to stop them, indicating that they were not a part of the Government's policy. [117]\nAfter the end of the war, Croatia faced the challenges of post-war reconstruction, the return of refugees, establishing democracy, protecting human rights, and general social and economic development.\nThe 2000s period is characterized by democratization, economic growth, structural and social reforms, and problems such as unemployment, corruption, and the inefficiency of public administration.[129] In November 2000 and March 2001, the Parliament amended the Constitution, first adopted on 22 December 1990, changing its bicameral structure back into its historic unicameral form and reducing presidential powers.[130][131]\nA wave of anti-government protests in 2011 reflected a general dissatisfaction with the current political and economic situation. The protests brought together diverse political persuasions in response to recent government corruption scandals and called for early elections. On 28 October 2011 MPs voted to dissolve Parliament and the protests gradually subsided. President Ivo Josipovi\u0107 agreed to a dissolution of Sabor on Monday, 31 October and scheduled new elections for Sunday 4 December 2011.[141][142][143]\nCroatia was affected by the 2015 European migrant crisis when Hungary's closure of borders with Serbia pushed over 700,000 refugees and migrants to pass through Croatia on their way to other EU countries.[147]\nOn 25 January 2022, the OECD Council decided to open accession negotiations with Croatia. Throughout the accession process, Croatia is to implement numerous reforms that will advance all spheres of activity \u2013 from public services and the justice system to education, transport, finance, health, and trade. In line with the OECD Accession Roadmap from June 2022, Croatia will undergo technical reviews by 25 OECD committees and is so far progressing at a faster pace than expected. Full membership is expected in 2025 and is the last big foreign policy goal Croatia still has to achieve.[148][149][150][151]\nOn 1 January 2023 Croatia adopted the euro as its official currency, replacing the kuna, and became the 20th Eurozone member. On the same day, Croatia became the 27th member of the border-free Schengen Area, thus marking its full EU integration.[152]\nThe territory covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles), consisting of 56,414 square kilometres (21,782 square miles) of land and 128 square kilometres (49 square miles) of water. It is the world's 127th largest country.[156] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point of the Dinara peak at 1,831 metres (6,007 feet) near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south[156] to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border. Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets varying in size, 48 of which permanently inhabited. The largest islands are Cres and Krk,[156] each of them having an area of around 405 square kilometres (156 square miles).\nThe hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east which is part of the Pannonian Basin are traversed by major rivers such as Danube, Drava, Kupa, and the Sava. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Vojvodina. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt, and hydropower.[156]Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps.[157] Croatia hosts deep caves, 49 of which are deeper than 250 m (820.21 ft), 14 deeper than 500 m (1,640.42 ft) and three deeper than 1,000 m (3,280.84 ft). Croatia's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes, a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue.[158]\nMost of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Mean monthly temperature ranges between \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) in January and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in July. The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar featuring a snowy, forested climate at elevations above 1,200 metres (3,900 feet). The warmest areas are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by Mediterranean climate, as the sea moderates temperature highs. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in continental areas.\nBora is a dry, cold wind which blows from the mainland out to sea, whose gusts can reach hurricane strength, particularly in the channel below Velebit. On the picture Bora in the town of Senj.\nThe lowest temperature of \u221235.5 \u00b0C (\u221231.9 \u00b0F) was recorded on 3 February 1919 in \u010cakovec, and the highest temperature of 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F) was recorded on 4 August 1981 in Plo\u010de.[159][160]\nMean annual precipitation ranges between 600 millimetres (24 inches) and 3,500 millimetres (140 inches) depending on geographic region and climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Bi\u0161evo, Lastovo, Svetac, Vis) and the eastern parts of Slavonia. However, in the latter case, rain occurs mostly during the growing season. The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski Kotar.[159]\nPrevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area, prevailing winds are determined by local features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as the cool northeasterly bura or less frequently as the warm southerly jugo. The sunniest parts are the outer islands, Hvar and Kor\u010dula, where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general, and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year.[161]\nThe karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, some of which are the habitat of the only known aquatic cave vertebrate\u2014the olm. Forests are significantly present, as they cover 2,490,000 hectares (6,200,000 acres) representing 44% of Croatian land area. Other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.[165]\nCroatia hosts 37,000 known plant and animal species, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.[165] More than a thousand species are endemic, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.[165] The most serious threat is habitat loss and degradation. A further problem is presented by invasive alien species, especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae. Croatia had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.92/10, ranking it 113th of 172 countries.[167]\nInvasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect benthic habitat. Indigenous cultivated plant strains and domesticated animal breeds are numerous. They include five breeds of horses, five of cattle, eight of sheep, two of pigs, and one poultry. Indigenous breeds include nine that are endangered or critically endangered.[165] Croatia has 444 protected areas, encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight national parks, two strict reserves, and ten nature parks. The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in the preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network.[165]\nThe Republic of Croatia is a unitary, constitutional state using a parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are legislative, executive, and judiciary powers.[168]\nThe president of the republic (Croatian: Predsjednik Republike) is the head of state, directly elected to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to two terms. In addition to serving as commander in chief of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the parliament and has some influence on foreign policy.[168]\nThe Government is headed by the prime minister, who has four deputy prime ministers and 16 ministers in charge of particular sectors.[169] As the executive branch, it is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, enforcing the laws, and guiding foreign and internal policies. The Government is seated at Banski dvori in Zagreb.[168]\nCroatia has a civil law legal system in which law arises primarily from written statutes, with judges serving as implementers and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems. Croatian law is divided into two principal areas\u2014private and public law. Before EU accession negotiations were completed, Croatian legislation had been fully harmonised with the Community acquis.[172]\nThe main national courts are the Constitutional Court, which oversees violations of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court, which is the highest court of appeal. Administrative, Commercial, County, Misdemeanor, and Municipal courts handle cases in their respective domains.[173] Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are in the first instance decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials.[174] The State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.[175]\nAs of 2019, the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration employed 1,381[needs update] personnel and expended 765.295 million kunas (\u20ac101.17 million).[180] Stated aims of Croatian foreign policy include enhancing relations with neighbouring countries, developing international co-operation and promotion of the Croatian economy and Croatia itself.[181]\nCroatia is a member of the European Union. As of 2021, Croatia had unsolved border issues with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia.[182] Croatia is a member of NATO.[183][184] On 1 January 2023, Croatia simultaneously joined both the Schengen Area and the Eurozone,[185] having previously joined the ERM II on 10 July 2020.\nThe Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) consist of the Air Force, Army, and Navy branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the General Staff, which reports to the defence minister, who in turn reports to the president. According to the constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In case of immediate threat during wartime, he issues orders directly to the General Staff.[189]\nFollowing the 1991\u201395 war, defence spending and CAF size began a constant decline. As of 2019[update], military spending was an estimated 1.68% of the country's GDP, 67th globally.[190] In 2005 the budget fell below the NATO-required 2% of GDP, down from the record high of 11.1% in 1994.[191] Traditionally relying on conscripts, the CAF went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing, restructuring and professionalisation in the years before accession to NATO in April 2009. According to a presidential decree issued in 2006, the CAF employed around 18,100 active duty military personnel, 3,000 civilians and 2,000 voluntary conscripts between 18 and 30 years old in peacetime.[189]\nCompulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008.[156] Until 2008 military service was obligatory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine months. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for eight months of civilian service.[192]\nAs of May 2019[update], the Croatian military had 72 members stationed in foreign countries as part of United Nations-led international peacekeeping forces.[193] As of 2019[update], 323 troops served the NATO-led ISAF force in Afghanistan. Another 156 served with KFOR in Kosovo.[194][195]\nCroatia has a military-industrial sector that exported around 493 million kunas (\u20ac65,176 million) worth of military equipment in 2020.[196] Croatian-made weapons and vehicles used by CAF include the standard sidearm HS2000 manufactured by HS Produkt and the M-84D battle tank designed by the \u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107 factory. Uniforms and helmets worn by CAF soldiers are locally produced and marketed to other countries.[197]\nCroatia was first divided into counties in the Middle Ages.[198] The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, and Istria. The traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced oblasts and banovinas respectively.[199]\nCommunist-ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions. In 1918, the Transleithanian part was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar, Gospi\u0107, Ogulin, Osijek, Po\u017eega, Vara\u017edin, Vukovar, and Zagreb.[200][201]\nAs of 1992, Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the dual authority and legal status of a county and a city. County borders changed in some instances, last revised in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities.[202]Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level considers the entire country in a single unit; three NUTS 2 regions come below that. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia, and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses the counties along the Adriatic coast. Northwest Croatia includes Koprivnica-Kri\u017eevci, Krapina-Zagorje, Me\u0111imurje, Vara\u017edin, the city of Zagreb, and Zagreb counties and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas\u2014Bjelovar-Bilogora, Brod-Posavina, Karlovac, Osijek-Baranja, Po\u017eega-Slavonia, Sisak-Moslavina, Virovitica-Podravina, and Vukovar-Syrmia counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS local administrative unit divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to cities and municipalities.[203]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(June 2022)\nOn January 1, 2023, Croatia replaced the kuna as its national currency and adopted the euro, on the same day Croatia became part of the Schengen zone.\nCroatia's economy qualifies as high-income.[204]International Monetary Fund data projected that Croatian nominal GDP reached $67,84 billion, or $17.398 per capita for 2021[205] while purchasing power parity GDP was $132,88 billion, or $32.942 per capita.[206] According to Eurostat, Croatian GDP per capita in PPS stood at 65% of the EU average in 2019.[207] Real GDP growth in 2022 was 6.2 per cent.[208] The average net salary of a Croatian worker in October 2019 was 6,496 HRK per month (roughly 873 EUR), and the average gross salary was 8,813 HRK per month (roughly 1,185 EUR).[209] As of July 2019[update], the unemployment rate dropped to 7.2% from 9.6% in December 2018. The number of unemployed persons was 106.703. The unemployment rate between 1996 and 2018 averaged 17.38%, reaching an all-time high of 23.60% in January 2002 and a record low of 8.40% in September 2018.[210] In 2017, economic output was dominated by the service sector \u2014 accounting for 70.1% of GDP \u2014 followed by the industrial sector with 26.2% and agriculture accounting for 3.7%.[211]\nAccording to 2017 data, 1.9% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, 27.3% by industry and 70.8% in services.[211] Shipbuilding, food processing, pharmaceuticals, information technology, biochemical, and timber industry dominate the industrial sector. In 2018, Croatian exports were valued at 108 billion kunas (\u20ac14.61 billion) with 176 billion kunas (\u20ac23.82 billion) worth of imports. Croatia's largest trading partner was the rest of the European Union, led by Germany, Italy, and Slovenia.[212]\nAs a result of the war, economic infrastructure sustained massive damage, particularly the tourism industry. From 1989 to 1993, the GDP fell 40.5%. The Croatian state still controls significant economic sectors, with government expenditures accounting for 40% of GDP.[213] A particular concern is a backlogged judiciary system, with inefficient public administration and corruption, upending land ownership. In the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, published by Transparency International, the country ranked 57th.[214] At the end of June 2020, the national debt stood at 85.3% of GDP.[215]\nTourism dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20% of GDP. Tourism income for 2019 was estimated to be \u20ac10.5 billion.[216] Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy, increasing retail business, and increasing seasonal employment. The industry is counted as an export business because foreign visitor spending significantly reduces the country's trade imbalance.[217] The tourist industry has rapidly grown, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers since independence, attracting more than 11 million visitors each year.[218] Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy, Poland and Croatia itself provide the most visitors.[219] Tourist stays averaged 4.7 days in 2019.[220]\nMuch of the tourist industry is concentrated along the coast. Opatija was the first holiday resort. It first became popular in the middle of the 19th century. By the 1890s, it had become one of the largest European health resorts.[221] Resorts sprang up along the coast and islands, offering services catering to mass tourism and various niche markets. The most significant are nautical tourism, supported by marinas with more than 16 thousand berths, cultural tourism relying on the appeal of medieval coastal cities and cultural events taking place during the summer. Inland areas offer agrotourism, mountain resorts, and spas. Zagreb is a significant destination, rivalling major coastal cities and resorts.[222]\nCroatia ranked as the 23rd-most popular tourist destination in the world according to the World Tourism Organization in 2019.[225] About 15% of these visitors,[which?][quantify] or over one million per year, participate in naturism, for which Croatia is famous. It was the first European country to develop commercial naturist resorts.[226] In 2023, luggage storage company Bounce gave Croatia the highest solo travel index in the world (7.58),[227] while a joint Pinterest and Zola wedding trends report from 2023 put Croatia among the most popular honeymoon destinations.[228]\nThe motorway network was largely built in the late 1990s and the 2000s (decade). As of December 2020, Croatia had completed 1,313.8 kilometres (816.4 miles) of motorways, connecting Zagreb to other regions and following various European routes and four Pan-European corridors.[229][230][231] The busiest motorways are the A1, connecting Zagreb to Split and the A3, passing east to west through northwest Croatia and Slavonia.[232]\nA widespread network of state roads in Croatia acts as motorway feeder roads while connecting major settlements. The high quality and safety levels of the Croatian motorway network were tested and confirmed by EuroTAP and EuroTest programmes.[233][234]\nCroatia has an extensive rail network spanning 2,722 kilometres (1,691 miles), including 984 kilometres (611 miles) of electrified railways and 254 kilometres (158 miles) of double track railways.[235] The most significant railways in Croatia are within the Pan-European transport corridors Vb and X connecting Rijeka to Budapest and Ljubljana to Belgrade, both via Zagreb.[229]Croatian Railways operates all rail services.[236]\nThe construction of 2.4-kilometre-long Pelje\u0161ac Bridge, the biggest infrastructure project in Croatia connects the two halves of Dubrovnik-Neretva County and shortens the route from the West to the Pelje\u0161ac peninsula and the islands of Kor\u010dula and Lastovo by more than 32 km. The construction of the Pelje\u0161ac Bridge started in July 2018 after Croatian road operator Hrvatske ceste (HC) signed a 2.08 billion kuna deal for the works with a Chinese consortium led by China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). The project is co-financed by the European Union with 357 million euro. The construction was completed in July 2022.[237]\nThe busiest cargo seaport is the Port of Rijeka. The busiest passenger ports are Split and Zadar.[241][242] Many minor ports serve ferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities with ferry lines to several cities in Italy.[243] The largest river port is Vukovar, located on the Danube, representing the nation's outlet to the Pan-European transport corridor VII.[229][244]\n610 kilometres (380 miles) of crude oil pipelines serve Croatia, connecting the Rijeka oil terminal with refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, and several transhipment terminals. The system has a capacity of 20 million tonnes per year.[245] The natural gas transportation system comprises 2,113 kilometres (1,313 miles) of trunk and regional pipelines, and more than 300 associated structures, connecting production rigs, the Okoli natural gas storage facility, 27 end-users and 37 distribution systems.[246] Croatia also plays an important role in regional energy security. The floating liquefied natural gas import terminal off Krk island LNG Hrvatska commenced operations on January 1, 2021, positioning Croatia as a regional energy leader and contributing to diversification of Europe's energy supply.[16]\nCroatian energy production covers 85% of nationwide natural gas and 19% of oil demand. In 2008, 47.6% of Croatia's primary energy production involved natural gas (47.7%), hydropower (25.4%), crude oil (18.0%), fuelwood (8.4%), and other renewable energy sources (0.5%). In 2009, net total electrical power production reached 12,725 GWh, while it imported 28.5% of its electric power energy needs.[155]\nThe total fertility rate of 1.41 children per mother, is one of the lowest in the world, far below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 6.18 children rate in 1885.[211][250] Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate since 1991.[155] Croatia subsequently has one of the world's oldest populations, with an average age of 43.3 years.[251] The population rose steadily from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million, with the exceptions of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following the world wars.[155] The natural growth rate is negative[156] with the demographic transition completed in the 1970s.[252] In recent years, the Croatian government has been pressured to increase permit quotas for foreign workers, reaching an all-time high of 68.100 in 2019.[253] In accordance with its immigration policy, Croatia is trying to entice emigrants to return.[254] From 2008 to 2018, Croatia's population dropped by 10%.[255]\nThe population decrease was greater a result of war for independence. The war displaced large numbers of the population and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly occupied areas, more than 400,000 Croats were either removed from their homes by Serb forces or fled the violence.[256] During the war's final days, about 150\u2013200,000 Serbs fled before the arrival of Croatian forces during Operation Storm.[122][257] After the war, the number of displaced persons fell to about 250,000. The Croatian government cared for displaced persons via the social security system and the Office of Displaced Persons and Refugees.[258] Most of the territories abandoned during the war were settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly from north-western Bosnia, while some displaced people returned to their homes.[259][260]\nCroatian Constitution, Article 41</ref> According to the 2011 census, 91.36% of Croatians identify as Christian; of these, Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 86.28% of the population, after which follows Eastern Orthodoxy (4.44%), Protestantism (0.34%), and other Christians (0.30%).The largest religion after Christianity is Islam (1.47%). 4.57% of the population describe themselves as non-religious.[264] In the Eurostat Eurobarometer Poll of 2010, 69% of the population responded that \"they believe there is a God\".[265] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 70% answered yes to the question \"Is religion an important part of your daily life?\"[266] However, only 24% of the population attends religious services regularly.[267]\nA 2011 survey revealed that 78% of Croats claim knowledge of at least one foreign language.[271] According to a 2005 EC survey, 49% of Croats speak English as the second language, 34% speak German, 14% speak Italian, and 10% speak French. Russian is spoken by 4%, and 2% of Croats speak Spanish. However several large municipalities support minority languages. A majority of Slovenes (59%) have some knowledge of Croatian.[272] The country is a part of various language-based international associations, most notably the European Union Language Association.[273]\nUniversity of Zagreb is the largest Croatian university and the oldest university in the area covering Central Europe south of Vienna and all of Southeastern Europe (1669).\nLiteracy in Croatia stands at 99.2 per cent.[274] Primary education in Croatia starts at the age of six or seven and consists of eight grades. In 2007 a law was passed to increase free, noncompulsory education until 18 years of age. Compulsory education consists of eight grades of elementary school.\nSecondary education is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools. As of 2019, there are 2,103 elementary schools and 738 schools providing various forms of secondary education.[275] Primary and secondary education are also available in languages of recognised minorities in Croatia, where classes are held in Czech, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Serbian languages.[276]\nThere are 137 elementary and secondary level music and art schools, as well as 120 schools for disabled children and youth and 74 schools for adults.[277] Nationwide leaving exams (Croatian: dr\u017eavna matura) were introduced for secondary education students in the school year 2009\u20132010. It comprises three compulsory subjects (Croatian language, mathematics, and a foreign language) and optional subjects and is a prerequisite for university education.[278]\nCroatia has eight public universities and two private universities.[279] The University of Zadar, the first university in Croatia, was founded in 1396 and remained active until 1807, when other institutions of higher education took over until the foundation of the renewed University of Zadar in 2002.[280] The University of Zagreb, founded in 1669, is the oldest continuously operating university in Southeast Europe.[281] There are also 15 polytechnics, of which two are private, and 30 higher education institutions, of which 27 are private.[279] In total, there are 55 institutions of higher education in Croatia, attended by more than 157 thousand students.[277]\nThere are 205 companies, government or education system institutions and non-profit organisations in Croatia pursuing scientific research and development of technology. Combined, they spent more than 3 billion kuna (\u20ac400 million) and employed 10,191 full-time research staff in 2008.[155] Among the scientific institutes operating in Croatia, the largest is the Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute in Zagreb.[282] The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb is a learned society promoting language, culture, arts and science from its inception in 1866.[283] Croatia was ranked 44th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[284]\nThe European Investment Bank provided digital infrastructure and equipment to around 150 primary and secondary schools in Croatia. Twenty of these schools got specialised assistance in the form of gear, software, and services to help them integrate the teaching and administrative operations.[285][286]\nCroatia has a universal health care system, whose roots can be traced back to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen.[287] The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2017, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 22.0 billion kuna (\u20ac3.0 billion).[288] Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending.[289] In 2017, Croatia spent around 6.6% of its GDP on healthcare.[290]\nIn 2020, Croatia ranked 41st in the world in life expectancy with 76.0 years for men and 82.0 years for women, and it had a low infant mortality rate of 3.4 per 1,000 live births.[291]\nThere are hundreds of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 75 hospitals, and 13 clinics with 23,049 beds. The hospitals and clinics care for more than 700 thousand patients per year and employ 6,642 medical doctors, including 4,773 specialists. There is total of 69,841 health workers. There are 119 emergency units in health centres, responding to more than a million calls.[citation needed] The principal cause of death in 2016 was cardiovascular disease at 39.7% for men and 50.1% for women, followed by tumours, at 32.5% for men and 23.4% for women.[292] In 2016 it was estimated that 37.0% of Croatians are smokers.[293] According to 2016 data, 24.40% of the Croatian adult population is obese.[294]\nBecause of its geographical position, Croatia represents a blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroads of influences from western culture and the east since the schism between the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire, and also from Central Europe and Mediterranean culture.[307] The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th century proved crucial to the emancipation of Croatians and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to many historical figures.[62]\nIn 2019, Croatia had 95 professional theatres, 30 professional children's theatres, and 51 amateur theatres visited by more than 2.27 million viewers per year. Professional theatres employ 1,195 artists. There are 42 professional orchestras, ensembles, and choirs, attracting an annual attendance of 297 thousand. There are 75 cinemas with 166 screens and attendance of 5.026 million.[312]\nCroatia has 222 museums, visited by more than 2.71 million people in 2016. Furthermore, there are 1,768 libraries, containing 26.8 million volumes, and 19 state archives.[313] The book publishing market is dominated by several major publishers and the industry's centrepiece event\u2014Interliber exhibition held annually at Zagreb Fair.[314]\nArchitecture in Croatia reflects influences of bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influence is visible in public spaces and buildings in the north and the central regions, architecture found along coasts of Dalmatia and Istria exhibits Venetian influence.[315] Squares named after culture heroes, parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of Croatian towns and cities, especially where large scale Baroque urban planning took place, for instance in Osijek (Tvr\u0111a), Vara\u017edin, and Karlovac.[316][317] The subsequent influence of the Art Nouveau was reflected in contemporary architecture.[318] The architecture is the Mediterranean with a Venetian and Renaissance influence in major coastal urban areas exemplified in works of Giorgio da Sebenico and Nicolas of Florence such as the Cathedral of St. James in \u0160ibenik. The oldest preserved examples of Croatian architecture are the 9th-century churches, with the largest and the most representative among them being Church of St. Donatus in Zadar.[319][320]\nBesides the architecture encompassing the oldest artworks, there is a history of artists in Croatia reaching the Middle Ages. In that period the stone portal of the Trogir Cathedral was made by Radovan, representing the most important monument of Romanesque sculpture from Medieval Croatia. The Renaissance had the greatest impact on the Adriatic Sea coast since the remainder was embroiled in the Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War. With the waning of the Ottoman Empire, art flourished during the Baroque and Rococo. The 19th and 20th centuries brought affirmation of numerous Croatian artisans, helped by several patrons of the arts such as bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer.[321] Croatian artists of the period achieving renown were Vlaho Bukovac, Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, and Ivan Generali\u0107.[319][322]\nCroatian music varies from classical operas to modern-day rock. Vatroslav Lisinski created the country's first opera, Love and Malice, in 1846. Ivan Zajc composed more than a thousand pieces of music, including masses and oratorios. Pianist Ivo Pogoreli\u0107 has performed across the world.[322]\nIn Croatia, the Constitution guarantees the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech.[326] Croatia ranked 64th in the 2019 Press Freedom Index report compiled by Reporters Without Borders which noted that journalists who investigate corruption, organised crime or war crimes face challenges and that the Government was trying to influence the public broadcaster HRT's editorial policies.[327] In its 2019 Freedom in the World report, the Freedom House classified freedoms of press and speech in Croatia as generally free from political interference and manipulation, noting that journalists still face threats and occasional attacks.[328] The state-owned news agency HINA runs a wire service in Croatian and English on politics, economics, society, and culture.[329]\nAs of January 2021[update], there are thirteen nationwide free-to-air DVB-T television channels, with Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) operating four, RTL Televizija three, and Nova TV operating two channels, and the Croatian Olympic Committee, Kapital Net d.o.o., and Author d.o.o. companies operate the remaining three.[331] Also, there are 21 regional or local DVB-T television channels.[332] The HRT is also broadcasting a satellite TV channel.[333] In 2020, there were 155 radio stations and 27 TV stations in Croatia.[334][335] Cable television and IPTV networks are gaining ground. Cable television already serves 450 thousand people, around 10% of the total population of the country.[336][337]\nCroatian traditional cuisine varies from one region to another. Dalmatia and Istria have culinary influences of Italian and other Mediterranean cuisines which prominently feature various seafood, cooked vegetables and pasta, and condiments such as olive oil and garlic. Austrian, Hungarian, Turkish, and Balkan culinary styles influenced continental cuisine. In that area, meats, freshwater fish, and vegetable dishes are predominant.[348]\nThere are two distinct wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental in the northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, produces premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines are similar to those in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines are the norm.[348] Annual production of wine exceeds 140 million litres.[155] Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive beer production and consumption started.[349] The annual consumption of beer in 2020 was 78.7 litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.[350]\nThere are 11 restaurants in Croatia with a Michelin star and 89 restaurants bearing some of the Michelin's marks.[351]\n^Wilkes, John (1995).

The issue is political and in a state of flux in terms of what further provisions will be agreed for eurozone change. No eurozone member state has left, and there are no provisions to do so or to be expelled.[15]\nIn 1998, eleven member states of the European Union had met the euro convergence criteria, and the eurozone came into existence with the official launch of the euro (alongside national currencies) on 1 January 1999 in those countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece qualified in 2000 and was admitted on 1 January 2001.\nThese twelve founding members introduced physical euro banknotes and euro coins on 1 January 2002. After a short transition period, they took out of circulation and rendered invalid their pre-euro national coins and notes.\nBetween 2007 and 2023, eight new states have acceded: Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\nThe euro is also used in countries outside the EU. Four states (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) have signed formal agreements with the EU to use the euro and issue their own coins.[28][29] Nevertheless, they are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB and do not have a seat in the ECB or Euro Group.\nAkrotiri and Dhekelia (located on the island of Cyprus) belong to the United Kingdom, but there are agreements between the UK and Cyprus[citation needed] and between UK and EU[citation needed] about their partial integration with Cyprus and partial adoption of Cypriot law, including the usage of euro in Akrotiri and Dhekelia.[citation needed]\nKosovo and Montenegro officially adopted the euro as their sole currency without an agreement and, therefore, have no issuing rights.[29] These states are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB. However, sometimes the term eurozone is applied to all territories that have adopted the euro as their sole currency.[30][31][32] Further unilateral adoption of the euro (euroisation), by both non-euro EU and non-EU members, is opposed by the ECB and EU.[33]\nThe chart below provides a full summary of all applying exchange-rate regimes for EU members, since the birth, on 13 March 1979, of the European Monetary System with its Exchange Rate Mechanism and the related new common currency ECU. On 1 January 1999, the euro replaced the ECU 1:1 at the exchange rate markets. During 1979\u20131999, the D-Mark functioned as a de facto anchor for the ECU, meaning there was only a minor difference between pegging a currency against the ECU and pegging it against the D-Mark.\nThe eurozone was born with its first 11 member states on 1 January 1999. The first enlargement of the eurozone, to Greece, took place on 1 January 2001, one year before the euro physically entered into circulation. The next enlargements were to states which joined the EU in 2004, and then joined the eurozone on 1 January of the year noted: Slovenia in 2007, Cyprus in 2008, Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015. Croatia, which acceded to the EU in 2013, adopted the euro in 2023.\nAll new EU members joining the bloc after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 are obliged to adopt the euro under the terms of their accession treaties. However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria which need first to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion, which requires having been an ERM-member for a minimum of two years without the presence of \"severe tensions\" for the currency exchange rate.\nIn September 2011, a diplomatic source close to the euro adoption preparation talks with the seven remaining new member states who had yet to adopt the euro at that time (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania), claimed that the monetary union (eurozone) they had thought they were going to join upon their signing of the accession treaty may very well end up being a very different union, entailing a much closer fiscal, economic, and political convergence than originally anticipated. This changed legal status of the eurozone could potentially cause them to conclude that the conditions for their promise to join were no longer valid, which \"could force them to stage new referendums\" on euro adoption.[34]\nBefore joining the eurozone, a state must spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II). As of January 2023[update], the Danish central bank and the Bulgarian central bank participate in ERM II.\nDenmark obtained a special opt-out in the original Maastricht Treaty, and thus is legally exempt from joining the eurozone unless its government decides otherwise, either by parliamentary vote or referendum. The United Kingdom likewise had an opt-out prior to withdrawing from the EU in 2020.\nThe remaining six countries are obliged to adopt the euro in future, although the EU has so far not tried to enforce any time plan. They should join as soon as they fulfill the convergence criteria, which include being part of ERM II for two years. Sweden, which joined the EU in 1995 after the Maastricht Treaty was signed, is required to join the eurozone. However, the Swedish people turned down euro adoption in a 2003 referendum and since then the country has intentionally avoided fulfilling the adoption requirements by not joining ERM II, which is voluntary.[35][36] Bulgaria joined ERM II on 10 July 2020.[37]\nInterest in joining the eurozone increased in Denmark, and initially in Poland, as a result of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. In Iceland, there was an increase in interest in joining the European Union, a pre-condition for adopting the euro.[38] However, by 2010 the debt crisis in the eurozone caused interest from Poland, as well as the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden to cool.[39]\nIn the opinion of journalist Leigh Phillips and Locke Lord's Charles Proctor,[40][41] there is no provision in any European Union treaty for an exit from the eurozone. In fact, they argued, the Treaties make it clear that the process of monetary union was intended to be \"irreversible\" and \"irrevocable\".[41] However, in 2009, a European Central Bank legal study argued that, while voluntary withdrawal is legally not possible, expulsion remains \"conceivable\".[42] Although an explicit provision for an exit option does not exist, many experts and politicians in Europe have suggested an option to leave the eurozone should be included in the relevant treaties.[43]\nOn the issue of leaving the eurozone, the European Commission has stated that \"[t]he irrevocability of membership in the euro area is an integral part of the Treaty framework and the Commission, as a guardian of the EU Treaties, intends to fully respect [that irrevocability].\"[44] It added that it \"does not intend to propose [any] amendment\" to the relevant Treaties, the current status being \"the best way going forward to increase the resilience of euro area Member States to potential economic and financial crises.[44] The European Central Bank, responding to a question by a Member of the European Parliament, has stated that an exit is not allowed under the Treaties.[45]\nLikewise there is no provision for a state to be expelled from the euro.[46] Some, however, including the Dutch government, favour the creation of an expulsion provision for the case whereby a heavily indebted state in the eurozone refuses to comply with an EU economic reform policy.[47]\nIn a Texas law journal, University of Texas at Austin law professor Jens Dammann has argued that even now EU law contains an implicit right for member states to leave the eurozone if they no longer meet the criteria that they had to meet in order to join it.[48] Furthermore, he has suggested that, under narrow circumstances, the European Union can expel member states from the eurozone.[49]\nThe monetary policy of all countries in the eurozone is managed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem which comprises the ECB and the central banks of the EU states who have joined the eurozone. Countries outside the eurozone are not represented in these institutions. Whereas all EU member states are part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), non EU member states have no say in all three institutions, even those with monetary agreements such as Monaco. The ECB is entitled to authorise the design and printing of euro banknotes and the volume of euro coins minted, and its president is currently Christine Lagarde.\nThe eurozone is represented politically by its finance ministers, known collectively as the Eurogroup, and is presided over by a president, currently Paschal Donohoe. The finance ministers of the EU member states that use the euro meet a day before a meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) of the Council of the European Union. The Group is not an official Council formation but when the full EcoFin council votes on matters only affecting the eurozone, only Euro Group members are permitted to vote on it.[50][51][52]\nSince the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the Euro Group has met irregularly not as finance ministers, but as heads of state and government (like the European Council). It is in this forum, the Euro summit, that many eurozone reforms have been decided upon. In 2011, former French PresidentNicolas Sarkozy pushed for these summits to become regular and twice a year in order for it to be a 'true economic government'.[citation needed]\nIn April 2008 in Brussels, future European CommissionPresidentJean-Claude Juncker suggested that the eurozone should be represented at the IMF as a bloc, rather than each member state separately: \"It is absurd for those 15 countries not to agree to have a single representation at the IMF. It makes us look absolutely ridiculous. We are regarded as buffoons on the international scene\".[53] In 2017 Juncker stated that he aims to have this agreed by the end of his mandate in 2019.[54] However, Finance CommissionerJoaqu\u00edn Almunia stated that before there is common representation, a common political agenda should be agreed upon.[53]\nLeading EU figures including the commission and national governments have proposed a variety of reforms to the eurozone's architecture; notably the creation of a Finance Minister, a larger eurozone budget, and reform of the current bailout mechanisms into either a \"European Monetary Fund\" or a eurozone Treasury. While many have similar themes, details vary greatly.[55][56][57][58]\nThe 20 largest economies in the world including eurozone as a single entity, by nominal GDP (2020) at their peak level of GDP in billions US$. The values for EU members that are not also eurozone members are listed both separately and as part of the EU.[60]\nInterest rates for the eurozone, set by the ECB since 1999.[62] Levels are in percentages per annum. Between June 2000 and October 2008, the main refinancing operations were variable rate tenders, as opposed to fixed rate tenders. The figures indicated in the table from 2000 to 2008 refer to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.[4]\nComparison of government surplus/deficit (2001\u20132012) of eurozone, United States and United Kingdom\nThe primary means for fiscal coordination within the EU lies in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which are written for every member state, but with particular reference to the 20 current members of the eurozone. These guidelines are not binding, but are intended to represent policy coordination among the EU member states, so as to take into account the linked structures of their economies.\nFor their mutual assurance and stability of the currency, members of the eurozone have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, which sets agreed limits on deficits and national debt, with associated sanctions for deviation. The Pact originally set a limit of 3% of GDP for the yearly deficit of all eurozone member states; with fines for any state which exceeded this amount. In 2005, Portugal, Germany, and France had all exceeded this amount, but the Council of Ministers had not voted to fine those states. Subsequently, reforms were adopted to provide more flexibility and ensure that the deficit criteria took into account the economic conditions of the member states, and additional factors.\nOlivier Blanchard suggests that a fiscal union in the eurozone can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the eurozone peripheral countries. But he adds that the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the eurozone peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, they are forced to adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.[71]\nThe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 prompted a number of reforms in the eurozone. One was a U-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy that led to the creation of a specific fund to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However, the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the EU treaties. Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a permanent treaty basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article 136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.\nIn February 2016, the UK secured further confirmation that countries that do not use the Euro would not be required to contribute to bailouts for eurozone countries.[72]\nIn June 2010, a broad agreement was finally reached on a controversial proposal for member states to peer review each other's budgets prior to their presentation to national parliaments. Although showing the entire budget to each other was opposed by Germany, Sweden and the UK, each government would present to their peers and the Commission their estimates for growth, inflation, revenue and expenditure levels six months before they go to national parliaments. If a country was to run a deficit, they would have to justify it to the rest of the EU while countries with a debt more than 60% of GDP would face greater scrutiny.[73]\nThe plans would apply to all EU members, not just the eurozone, and have to be approved by EU leaders along with proposals for states to face sanctions before they reach the 3% limit in the Stability and Growth Pact. Poland has criticised the idea of withholding regional funding for those who break the deficit limits, as that would only impact the poorer states.[73] In June 2010 France agreed to back Germany's plan for suspending the voting rights of members who breach the rules.[74] In March 2011 was initiated a new reform of the Stability and Growth Pact aiming at straightening the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the deficit or the debt rules.[75][76]\nIn 1997, Arnulf Baring expressed concern that the European Monetary Union would make Germans the most hated people in Europe. Baring suspected the possibility that the people in Mediterranean countries would regard Germans and the currency bloc as economic policemen.[77]\nIn 2001, James Tobin thought that the euro project would not succeed without making drastic changes to European institutions, pointing out the difference between the US and the eurozone.[78] Concerning monetary policies, the system of Federal Reserve banks in the US aims at both growth and reducing unemployment, while the ECB tends to give its first priority to price stability under the Bundesbank's supervision. As the price level of the currency bloc is kept low, the unemployment level of the region has become higher than that of the US since 1982.[78] Concerning fiscal policies, 12% of the US federal budget is used for transfers to states and local governments. The US government does not impose restrictions on state budget policies, whereas the Treaty of Maastricht requires each eurozone member country to keep its budget deficit below 3% of its GDP.[78]\nThe eurozone has also been criticized for deepening inequality in Europe, particularly between the richest and poorest countries.[83] According to a study by Bertelsmann Stiftung, countries such as Austria and the Netherlands benefited significantly from the common currency, while southern and eastern European members of the eurozone gained very little,[84] and some countries are considered to have suffered adverse effects from adopting the euro.[85] In an article for the Politico, Joseph Stiglitz argues: \"The result for the eurozone has been slower growth, and especially for the weaker countries within it. The euro was supposed to usher in greater prosperity, which in turn would lead to renewed commitment to European integration. It has done just the opposite \u2014 increasing divisions within the EU, especially between creditor and debtor countries.\"[85] Matthias Matthijs believes that the euro resulted in a \"winner-take-all\" economy, as national income differences between eurozone members have widened further.[86] He argues that countries such as Austria and Germany have gained from the eurozone at the expense of southern countries like Italy and Spain.[86]\nBy adopting the euro and abandoning their national currencies, eurozone countries gave up their ability to conduct independent monetary policy; as such, monetary policies used to combat recession, such as monetary stimulus or currency devaluation, are no longer available.[86] During the European debt crisis, several eurozone countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus) were unable to repay their debt without third-party intervention by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.[87] In order to grant the bailout, the ECB and the IMF forced the affected countries to adopt strict austerity measures.[86] The European bailouts were largely about shifting exposure from banks onto European taxpayers,[88][89][90] and exacerbated issues such as high unemployment and poverty.[91][92]\nIn 2019, a study from the Centre for European Policy concluded that while some countries had gained from adopting the euro, several countries were poorer than they would have been had they not adopted it, with France and Italy being particularly affected.[93][94] The publication prompted a large number of reactions, pushing its authors to put out a statement clarifying some points.[95] In 2020, a study from the University of Bonn reached a different conclusion: the adoption of the euro made \u201csome mild losers (France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal) and a clear winner (Ireland)\u201d.[96] Both studies used the synthetic control method to estimate what might have happened if the euro hadn't been adopted.\n^Includes the population of Croatia, even though it was not a eurozone member in 2021.\n^The ECB announced on 22 December 1998 that, between 4 and 21 January 1999, there would be a narrow corridor of 50 basis points interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility in order to help the transition to the ECB's interest regime.",

        "context": "\nThe Schengen Area has a population of more than 423 million people and an area of 4,368,693 square kilometres (1,686,762 sq mi).[3] About 1.7 million people commute to work across an internal European border each day, and in some regions these people constitute up to a third of the workforce. In 2015, there were 1.3 billion crossings of Schengen borders in total. 57 million crossings were due to transport of goods by road, with a value of \u20ac2.8 trillion.[4][5][6] The decrease in the cost of trade due to Schengen varies from 0.42% to 1.59% depending on geography, trade partners, and other factors. Countries outside of the Schengen Area also benefit.[7] States in the Schengen Area have strengthened border controls with non-Schengen countries.[8]\nThe Schengen Agreement was signed on 14 June 1985 by five of the ten EC member states[9] in the town of Schengen, Luxembourg. The Schengen Area was established separately from the European Communities, when consensus could not be reached among all EC member states on the abolition of border controls.\nThe Agreement was supplemented in 1990 by the Schengen Convention, which proposed the abolition of internal border controls and a common visa policy.[10] The Agreements and the rules adopted under them were entirely separate from the EC structures, and led to the creation of the Schengen Area on 26 March 1995.[11]\nAs more EU member states signed the Schengen Agreement, consensus was reached on absorbing it into the procedures of the EU. The Agreement and its related conventions were incorporated into the mainstream of European Union law by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997, which came into effect in 1999. A consequence of the Agreement being part of European law is that any amendment or regulation is made within its processes, in which the non-EU members are not participants.\nThe UK, the Crown Dependencies, and the Republic of Ireland have operated a Common Travel Area (CTA) since 1923 (with passport-free travel and freedom of movement with each other), but the UK would not abolish border controls with any other countries and therefore opted out of the Agreement. While not signing the Schengen Treaty, the Republic of Ireland has always looked more favourably on joining, but has not done so in order to maintain the CTA and its open border with Northern Ireland.[12]\nThe common visa policy allows nationals of certain countries to enter the Schengen Area via air, land or sea without a visa for stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Nationals of certain other countries are required to have a visa either upon arrival or in transit.\nSome Atlantic islands such as the Canary islands are also in the Schengen Area\nThis is a clickable map\nThe Schengen Area consists of 27 countries, including four which are not members of the European Union (EU). Two of the non-EU members \u2013 Iceland and Norway \u2013 are part of the Nordic Passport Union and are officially classified as states associated with the Schengen activities of the EU.[13]Switzerland was allowed to participate in the same manner in 2008. Croatia joined the Schengen Area on 1 January 2023. De facto, the Schengen Area also includes four European micro-states \u2013 Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City \u2013 that maintain open or semi-open borders with other Schengen member countries.[14] Although Andorra\u2019s agreements with France and Spain make it effectively part of Schengen,[15] this can be avoided by requesting entry and exit stamps at the border.[16]\nOne EU member state \u2013 Ireland \u2013 negotiated opt-outs from Schengen and continues to operate border controls with other EU member states, while at the same time being part of the open-border Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom (a former EU member) and the Crown Dependencies. The remaining three EU member states \u2013 Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania \u2013 are obliged by their Treaties of Accession to join the Schengen Area eventually. However, before fully implementing the Schengen rules, each state must have its preparedness assessed in four areas: air borders, visas, police cooperation, and personal data protection. This evaluation process involves a questionnaire and visits by EU experts to selected institutions and workplaces in the country under assessment.[17]\nThe only land borders with border controls (not counting temporary ones) between EU/EEA members, are those dividing Bulgaria and Romania from each other and from the rest of the EU.[18]\n^Greenland and the Faroe Islands are not included in the Schengen Area. However, persons travelling between the Faroe Islands, Greenland and the Schengen Area are not subject to border checks.[32] The list of countries whose citizens require a visa for Greenland or the Faroe Islands is the same as for the Schengen Area,[33][34] but a Schengen visa will not allow the holder access to either territory, only a Danish visa stamped with either \"Valid for the Faroe Islands\" or \"Valid for Greenland\", or both.[35]\n^The overseas departments and collectivities of France are not part of the Schengen Area. However, when travelling by air from metropolitan France directly to French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, R\u00e9union and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, border checks by the French Border Police only take place at the departure airport, not at the arrival airport (where passengers walk past the passport control booths, which will be unstaffed). This arrangement does not, however, apply to direct flights from other Schengen member states, such as the Frankfurt-Martinique flight by Condor. On the other hand, passengers flying from French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, R\u00e9union and Saint Pierre and Miquelon directly to metropolitan France have to undergo border checks by the French Border Police both on departure and on arrival (an arrangement known as 'double contr\u00f4le').[39]\n^East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, joining Schengen, on 3 October 1990.\n^According to a legally non-binding declaration attached to the Greek accession agreement to the Schengen convention,[41] the special status[42] according to the Greek constitution[43] of Mount Athos, has to be taken into account in the application and subsequent preparation of the Schengen acquis.\n^Currently Greece does not have internal land border within Schengen space. All internal border crossings are at the airports or at maritime ports\n^The elimination of border controls took place from 1 January 2000 to 26 March 2000.[45]\n^ abcdEFTA state, which is outside the EU, that is associated with the Schengen activities of the EU,[13] and where the Schengen rules apply.\n^ abA second agreement, which replaced the first, was signed with Iceland and Norway following the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into EU law with the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997.[48]\n^The elimination of border controls took place from 26 October 1997 to 31 March 1998.[50]\n^The full Schengen acquis applies to all Spanish territories, but there are border checks on departure from Ceuta and Melilla to Peninsular Spain or other Schengen countries, because of specific arrangements for visa exemptions for Moroccan nationals resident in the provinces of Tetuan and Nador.[55]\n^For overland borders and seaports; since 29 March 2009 also for airports.[60]\nThe procedure to enter the Schengen Area is that European Commission evaluates certain criteria. These criteria include border control legislation, infrastructure and organisation, personal data protection, visas, deportations, police cooperation and more.[61] After a positive evaluation the Schengen members of the Council of the European Union decides unanimously together with the European Parliament to accept the new member.\nAlthough Cyprus, which joined the EU on 1 May 2004, is legally bound to join the Schengen Area, implementation has been delayed because of the Cyprus dispute. According to former Cypriot Minister of Foreign Affairs Giorgos Lillikas, \"strict and full control based on Schengen will create a huge tribulation on a daily basis for the Turkish Cypriots\" of Northern Cyprus, and it is unclear if this control is possible before the resolution of the dispute.[62] The British Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, a British Overseas Territory which is outside the EU, also needs \"other handling and mechanisms\".[62] Akrotiri and Dhekelia has no border control to Cyprus, but has its own border control at its air base. As of 2018[update] no date has been fixed for implementation of the Schengen rules by Cyprus.[63] Cyprus has less potential benefit from an implementation of Schengen, for it has no land border with another EU member; air travel or around 12 hours of sea travel is needed to the nearest EU member.\nIn November 2019, Cyprus's Foreign Affairs Minister Nikos Christodoulides revealed that Cyprus formally began the process of joining the Schengen Area in September.[64] In 2023, Cyprus joined the Schengen Information System (SIS), meaning that the country has not fully joined the Schengen Area, but that it is very close to achieving this (the implementation of the SIS being one of the last steps). Participation in the SIS allows for cooperation on crime, immigration and other security-related matters within the Schengen Area.[65]\nWhile Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU on 1 January 2007, are also legally bound to join the Schengen Area, implementation has been delayed. On 15 October 2010, Bulgaria and Romania joined SIS II for law enforcement cooperation.[66] On 9 June 2011, the Council of Ministers concluded that the evaluation process had been completed successfully and that the two countries fulfilled all technical accession criteria.[67] Bulgaria's and Romania's bids to join the Schengen Area were approved by the European Parliament in June 2011[68] but rejected by the Council of Ministers in September 2011, with the Dutch and Finnish governments citing concerns about shortcomings in anti-corruption measures and in the fight against organised crime.[69][70] Although the original plan was for the Schengen Area to open its air and sea borders with Bulgaria and Romania by March 2012, and its land borders by July 2012,[70] continued opposition from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands has delayed the two countries' entry to the Schengen Area.[71][72] On 4 October 2017, the European Parliament voted for access of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Information System,[73] on which they gained full access on 1 August 2018.[74] Moreover, \"the final political decision whether the two countries can become part of the Schengen Area and stop systematic border checks with neighbouring EU countries must be taken unanimously by all sides of the European Council.\"[73] On 11 December 2018, the European Parliament voted for the resolution in favour of accepting both countries, requiring the Council of the European Union to \"act swiftly\" on the matter.[75][76]\nOn 3 March 2022, Romanian MEP Eugen Tomac officially requested an answer through a parliamentary question regarding \"what obstacles remain in the path of Romanian accession to the Schengen area 15 years after joining the EU\" as fulfilment of the accession criteria was recognised on 9 June 2011.[77]\nA second attempt for Romania's accession to Schengen was to be established in the Justice and Home Affairs Council from 8\u20139 December 2022, with the EC announcing the topics on the agenda of the meeting,[78] which failed following opposition by Austria,[79] as officials considered Bulgaria and Romania to be a transit route for most immigrants to the country.[80] Romania disputes that assessment,[81] and had unsuccessfully attempted to convince the Austrian government to vote for Romania's accession to Schengen.[82] Despite having declared support for Romania, the Netherlands also voted against due to its opposition for the accession of Bulgaria.[79]\nIn Romania, the Austrian veto caused strong indignation. As a result of the veto, relations between the two states were reduced following the withdrawal of Romania's ambassador to Austria from Vienna.[83] A boycott against Austria by Romanian companies, entrepreneurs, museums and universities also began,[84] and anti-Austrian inscriptions also appeared in branches of Austrian banks in Romania.[85]\nAccording to Euractiv, European institutions are preparing to admit Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen Area in 2023, with border control-free travel by air planned for October 2023, followed by the abolition of land border controls by 1 January 2024.[86] In a resolution, which members of the European Parliament call on the Council to approve Romania and Bulgaria\u2019s accession to the Schengen free-travel area by the end of 2023, adopted on 12 July with 526 votes in favour, 57 votes against, and 42 abstaining, Parliament stresses that \"both countries have already fulfilled the necessary requirements to be admitted into Schengen\".[87] However, in September 2023 Austria reiterated its objection to admitting the countries to the Schengen Area.[88] In response, Romania threatened to challenge Austria's veto at the European Court of Justice to claim financial compensation.[89]\nThe Gibraltar/Spain border in 2004 with the Rock of Gibraltar in the background\nAs a result of Brexit, Gibraltar ceased to be part of the European Union on 31 January 2020, although for most purposes it was treated as part of it during the transition phase until 31 December 2020. Like the United Kingdom, it had not been part of the Schengen Area but, unlike the United Kingdom, Gibraltar had also been outside of the EU customs union.[90] Owing to a declaration lodged by the United Kingdom with the EEC in 1982, in view of the entry into force of the British Nationality Act 1981, Gibraltarians had been counted as British nationals for the purposes of Community law, and as such they had enjoyed full free movement within the European Economic Area and Switzerland.[91] During the Brexit transition period until 31 December 2020, Gibraltar was still for most purposes treated as an EU territory.\nOn 31 December 2020, the governments of Spain and of the United Kingdom (advised by the Government of Gibraltar) came to an agreement in principle on a framework for a UK-EU treaty on aspects of Gibraltar's future relationship with the European Union.[92] Both Spain and the Head of the UK Mission to the European Union subsequently indicated with the European Commission their desire that such an agreement be negotiated and that the EU should seek a mandate for that purpose.[93]\nChief Minister of GibraltarFabian Picardo stated that he anticipates that the arrangement, which will apply for an initial period of four years, will make Gibraltar's port and airport entry points to the Schengen Area. These entry points will be managed by a Frontex operation. Spain, as the neighbouring Schengen member state, will be responsible as regards the European Union for the implementation of the Schengen acquis. Residents of Gibraltar, regardless of their nationality, are anticipated to enjoy maximised and unrestricted mobility to the Schengen Area.[94][93] UK citizens who are not residents of Gibraltar will be subjected to third-country national checks when they enter Gibraltar through the Gibraltar port or airport.[95] It is anticipated that the third-country national check will entail two controls, one by Gibraltar's Borders and Coastguard Agency, giving entry into Gibraltar, and one by Frontex, giving entry into the Schengen Area. Picardo likened this arrangement to the juxtaposed controls at Eurostar stations, although he admitted the situation there is slightly different.[96]\nOn 31 December 2020, Spain's foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said that she anticipated that it would take about six months to negotiate and conclude a treaty but that in the meantime Spain would work to ensure that mobility at the border would be \"as fluid as possible\".[92]\nApart from the unrestricted mobility of persons, the negotiations will also seek to address maximised and unrestricted mobility of goods between Gibraltar and the European Union, and consider matters related to the environment, the level playing field, social security coordination, citizens\u2019 rights, data, and matters related to continued document recognition.[93]\nOn 6 October 2021, the EU agreed to open formal negotiations with UK anticipating an agreement on Gibraltar, and negotiations started soon after.[97] They were ongoing as of February 2022, hopes were they would finish during spring 2022.[98] As of December 2022[update], negotiations were continuing,[99] but appeared to be deadlocked over policing of passport control at Gibraltar airport.[100]\nNo consensus in the Council of the European Union for Justice and Home Affairs that the country should join the Schengen Area, despite fulfilling the formal accession criteria, due to the CVM reports \"showing inadequacies in coming up to the EU's standards for the fight against organised crime and corruption\". On 8 December 2022, the council voted unanimously in favour of Croatia joining but Austria and the Netherlands voted against Romania and Bulgaria joining due to the inflow of illegal migrants and Bulgaria being joined to Romania in the accession process.[103][104][105]\nEU and UK to negotiate a treaty or other arrangement for application in Gibraltar, based on the agreement reached between the UK and Spain on 31 December 2020.[108][109] Gibraltar is not a sovereign state, so in international law the UK acts on behalf of Gibraltar. (See also Effect of Brexit on Gibraltar#Post-Brexit.)\nNo consensus in the Council of the European Union for Justice and Home Affairs that the country should join the Schengen Area, despite fulfilling the formal accession criteria. In June 2021, Romanian PMFlorin C\u00ee\u021bu identified a \"discussion about the CVM report\" as an obstacle.[110] On 8 December 2022, the council voted unanimously in favour of Croatia joining but Austria and the Netherlands voted against Romania and Bulgaria joining due to the inflow of illegal migrants and Bulgaria being joined to Romania in the accession process.[103][78]\nThere are territories of Schengen member states that are exempted from the Schengen Agreement. The only areas of Schengen member states located in Europe but excluded are the Faroe Islands and Svalbard.\nOnly the Netherlands' European territory is part of the Schengen Area. Six Dutch territories in the Caribbean are outside the Area. Three of these territories \u2013 Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (collectively known as the BES islands) \u2013 are special municipalities within the Netherlands proper. The other three \u2013 Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten \u2013 are autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. All islands retain their status as Overseas countries and territories and are thus not part of the European Union. The six territories have a separate visa system from the European part of the Netherlands and people travelling between these islands and the Schengen Area are subjected to full border checks, with a passport being required even for EU/Schengen citizens, including Dutch (national ID cards are not accepted).[114]\nSvalbard is part of Norway and has a special status under international law. It is not part of the Schengen Area. There is no visa regime in existence for Svalbard either for entry, residence or work,[115] but it is difficult to visit Svalbard without travelling through the Schengen Area,[115] although there are charter flights from Russia. Since 2011, the Norwegian government has imposed systematic border checks on individuals wishing to enter and leave Svalbard, requiring a passport or national identity card for non-Norwegian citizens. As a result, the border between Svalbard and the rest of Norway is largely treated like any other external Schengen border.[116] A Schengen visa must be multiple entry to allow returning to Norway.[117] There is no welfare or asylum system for immigrants on Svalbard, and people incapable of supporting themselves may be sent away.[117]\nThe Danish territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland are neither part of the European Union nor part of the Schengen Area, and visas to Denmark are not automatically valid in these territories. However, both of these territories lack border controls on arrivals from the Schengen Area, and the air or sea carriers are responsible for carrying out document checks before boarding, as is common for travel inside the Schengen Area. Citizens of EU/EFTA countries can travel to the Faroes using a passport or a national ID card[118] and to Greenland using a passport only,[119] while citizens of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway or Sweden can use any acceptable identification (such as driving licences or bank ID cards; although this is advised against since aircraft might be diverted to Scotland in bad weather).[118][119]\nWhen EU states were negotiating subsuming the Schengen Agreement into the EU by the Treaty of Amsterdam, Ireland and the United Kingdom were the only member states that had not signed the Agreement. The UK did not want to join and Ireland wished to maintain its Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom and associated islands, an arrangement that would be incompatible with Schengen membership while the UK remained out. As a result, both negotiated an opt-out from the part of the treaty which was to incorporate the Schengen rules (or acquis) into EU Law when it came into effect on 1 May 1999.[120] Under the relevant protocol, either may request to participate in aspects of the Schengen acquis but this is subject to the approval of the Schengen states.[121]\nIn 1999, the UK formally requested participation in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis \u2013 Title III relating to Police Security and Judicial Cooperation, and this request was approved by the Council of the European Union on 29 May 2000.[123] The United Kingdom's formal participation in the previously approved areas of cooperation was put into effect by a 2004 Council decision that came into effect on 1 January 2005.[124]\nAlthough the United Kingdom was not part of the Schengen passport-free area,[125] it still used the Schengen Information System, a governmental database used by European countries to store and disseminate information on individuals and property. This allowed the UK to exchange information with countries that are a part of the Schengen agreement, often for the sake of liaising over law enforcement.[126] In 2020, the UK declared its intent to withdraw from these arrangements at the end of its transition period, and did so on 31 December 2020.\nIn contrast, while Ireland initially submitted a request to participate in the Schengen acquis in 2002, which was approved by the Council of the European Union,[127] that decision took nearly eighteen years to be put into effect. In February 2010 the Irish Minister for Justice, in response to a parliamentary question, said that: \"The measures which will enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being progressed\".[128] Ireland joined the law enforcement aspect of SIS II on 1 January 2021 with plans to have \"full operational capacity\" two months later.[129][130]\nThree European microstates\u2014Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City\u2014are officially not part of Schengen, but are considered de facto within the Schengen Area, as they have open borders and do not have border controls with the Schengen countries that surround them. Some national laws have the text \"countries against which border control is not performed based on the Schengen Agreement and the 562/2006 EU regulation\",[131] which then includes the microstates and other non-EU areas with open borders. The three microstates cannot issue Schengen visas and with the exception of Monaco, are not formally part of the Schengen Area.\nAndorra is landlocked and does not have an airport or seaport, but there are several heliports. Visitors to the country can only gain access by road or helicopter through Schengen members France or Spain. Andorra maintains border controls with both France and Spain. There are border controls in the other direction also, but these are more focused on customs control (Andorra has considerably lower taxes than its neighbours, with for example a standard VAT rate of just 4.5%). Andorra does not have any visa requirements. Citizens of EU countries need either a national identity card or passport to enter Andorra, while anyone else requires a passport or equivalent. Schengen visas are accepted,[132] but those travellers who need a visa to enter the Schengen Area need a multiple-entry visa to visit Andorra, because entering Andorra means leaving the Schengen Area,[133] and re-entering France or Spain is considered a new entry into the Schengen Area. Andorran citizens do not receive a passport stamp when they enter and leave the Schengen Area.[134] Andorra's ambassador to Spain, Jaume Gayt\u00e1n, has said that he hopes that the agreement will include provisions to make the states associate members of the Schengen Agreement.[135]\nLiechtenstein is landlocked and does not have an international airport. It has been a member of the Schengen Area since 2011. It does not have a border check at Balzers heliport, as flights to and from Balzers must be to or from the Schengen Area. Liechtenstein does not issue visas and as such recommends visitors apply for a visa in another Schengen country, e.g. Switzerland.[136]\nMonaco has an open border with France. Schengen laws are administered as if it were part of the EU as a result of bilateral agreements with France, and Schengen visas are accepted. Both French and Mon\u00e9gasque authorities carry out checks at Monaco's seaport and heliport.\nThe Vatican City has an open border with Italy. However, there is no customs union between Italy and Vatican City, hence vehicles may be subject to checks at the border. Typical border controls would not be feasible in Vatican City, due to its small size and unique position, as an enclave within Rome. In 2006, the Vatican City showed interest in joining the Schengen agreement for closer cooperation in information sharing and similar activities covered by the Schengen Information System.[137]\nTotal trade between any two countries in the Schengen Area increases by approximately 0.1% per year. The same amount of increase in trade is gained again for every 1% annual increase in immigration between the countries.[138][4] On average, at each border the removal of controls is equivalent to the removal of a 0.7% tariff, and the cost savings on a trade route increase with the number of internal borders crossed. Countries outside of the Schengen Area also benefit.[7]\nAbout 1.7 million people commute to work across a European border each day, and in some regions these people constitute up to a third of the workforce. For example, 2.1% of the workers in Hungary work in another country, primarily Austria and Slovakia. Each year, there are 1.3 billion crossings of Schengen borders in total. 57 million crossings are due to transport of goods by road, with a value of \u20ac2.8 trillion each year.[4][139][140] The trade in goods is affected more strongly than trade in services, and the decrease in the cost of trade varies from 0.42% to 1.59% depending on geography, trade partners, and other factors.[7]\nA typical Schengen internal border crossing has no border control post and only a common EU-state sign displaying the name of the country being entered, as here between Germany and Austria. The larger blue sign announces entry to the Federal Republic of Germany in German, the smaller white sign announces entry into the German state of Bavaria.\nBefore the implementation of the Schengen Agreement, most borders in Europe were patrolled and a vast network of border posts existed around the continent, to check the identity and entitlement of people wishing to travel from one country to another.\nSince the implementation of the Schengen rules, border posts have been closed (and often entirely removed) between participating countries.\nThe Schengen Borders Code requires participating states to remove all obstacles to free traffic flow at internal borders.[141] Thus, road, rail and air passengers no longer have their identity checked by border guards when travelling between Schengen countries, although security controls by carriers are still permissible.[142] Per EU guidelines all EU citizens are advised to bring a passport and/or national identity card, as one may be required.\nPassport stamps are never issued when travelling between Schengen member states, even when border controls between Schengen member states are temporarily re-introduced.[143]\nAlthough EU and EFTA nationals travelling within the Schengen Area are not required to show passports, national identity cards or other identity documents at an internal border, the laws of most countries still require them to carry national identity documents and to produce them to an authorised person on request.[144] Different rules apply to other nationals.[144] It is the obligation of everyone travelling within the area to be able to show a fully valid form of personal identification accepted by other Schengen states, typically one issued by the state.[145][146]\nAccording to the Schengen rules, hotels and other types of commercial accommodation must register all foreign citizens, including citizens of other Schengen states, by requiring the completion of a registration form by their own hand. This does not apply to accompanying spouses and minor children or members of travel groups. In addition, a valid identification document has to be produced to the hotel manager or staff.[147] The Schengen rules do not require any other procedures; thus, the Schengen states are free to regulate further details on the content of the registration forms, and identity documents which are to be produced, and may also require the persons exempted from registration by Schengen laws to be registered. Enforcement of these rules varies by country.\nThe Schengen regulation on crossing internal borders[148] describes the checks for foreigners done by the police at suitable places inside each country.[clarification needed]\nThe European Union constitutes a customs union and a Value Added Tax area. However, not all Schengen states or all of the territory of Schengen states are part of the customs union or VAT area. Some countries therefore legally conduct customs controls targeted at illegal goods, such as drugs.\nSecurity checks can legally be carried out at ports and airports. Also police checks can be conducted if they:[149]\ndo not have border control as an objective;\nare based on general police information and experience regarding possible threats to public security and aim, in particular, to combat cross-border crime;\nare devised and executed in a manner clearly distinct from systematic checks on persons at the external borders;\nFor flights within the Schengen Area (either between Schengen member states or within the same Schengen member state), law enforcement agencies, airport authorities and air carriers are only permitted to carry out security checks on passengers and may not carry out border checks.[150][151] Such security checks can be conducted through the verification of the passenger's passport or national identity card:[152][153] such a practice must only be used to verify the passenger's identity (for commercial or transport security reasons) and not his or her immigration status.[151] For this reason, law enforcement agencies, airport authorities and air carriers cannot require air passengers flying within the Schengen Area who are third-country nationals to prove the legality of their stay by showing a valid visa or residence permit.[151] In addition, according to European Commission guidelines, identity checks on air passengers flying within the Schengen Area should take place only either at check-in, or upon entry to the secured zone of the airport, or at the boarding gate: passengers should not be required to undergo a verification of their identity on more than one occasion before their flight within the Schengen Area.[151] Notwithstanding those principles, the identity checks function as practical border controls and they affect illegal immigrants who arrive in Greece (which currently has no land border to another Schengen country) and want to go to some other Schengen country.[154][155] The requirements as to which identity document to possess varies by country and airline. Normally a passport or EU national identity card is needed.\nTravellers boarding flights between Schengen countries, but originating from a third country outside the area, are required to go through Schengen entry border checks upon arrival in the Schengen Area. This is because the route originates outside the Schengen Area and the authorities at the final destination would have no way of differentiating between arriving passengers who boarded at the origin and those who joined in the middle. Additionally, travellers are required to process through Schengen exit border checks upon departure.\nA Schengen member state is permitted to reinstate border controls with another Schengen member state for a short period where there is a serious threat to that state's \"public policy or internal security\" or when the \"control of an external border is no longer ensured due to exceptional circumstances\".[156] When such risks arise out of foreseeable events, the state in question must notify the European Commission in advance and consult with other Schengen states.[157]\nThe introduction of temporary controls at internal borders is a prerogative of the member states. Although the European Commission may issue an opinion about the necessity and proportionality of introducing temporary controls at internal borders, it cannot veto or override such a decision if it is taken by a member state.[158]\nIn November 2017, Germany introduced temporary checks on flights arriving from Greece.[161][162][163] Between November 2017 and February 2018, of the 280,000 passengers on flights from Greece who were checked on arrival in Germany, 270 were denied entry into Germany.[164] On 12 May 2018, Germany ended the temporary checks on incoming flights from Greece.[165]\nIn 2019, Denmark set up border controls with Sweden due to serious attacks by Swedish citizens.[166] The controls were scheduled to be in force for six months.[167]\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, almost all Schengen countries set up border controls. Several of these controls blocked citizens of EU/Schengen countries from entering, only allowed citizens or residents of the country to enter, plus prioritised traffic like food transport.[168] On 27 March 2020, the European Commission published 'Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak', stating that member states should allow cross-border workers 'unhindered access' and 'ensure a smooth passage' across the internal Schengen borders if they exercise a 'critical occupation' (such as health professionals, care workers, scientists in health-related fields, workers in the pharmaceutical and medical services/food/transportation/essential infrastructure industries, engineers, Information and Communications Technology professionals, firefighters/police officers/prison officers/security guards, fishermen and public servants). Further, any health screening for cross-border workers must be carried out under the same conditions as the member state's own nationals exercising the same occupations.[169]\nThe yellow and green-coloured countries indicate Schengen members. The green lines indicate internal Schengen land borders without border controls, the yellow lines indicate internal Schengen land borders with ongoing temporary border controls and the red lines indicate the external Schengen land borders with or without full border controls.\nThe table below lists ongoing internal border controls, according to the information that the member states have provided to the European Commission.[170][171] Health checks at the borders are not legally considered to be border controls.[172]\nEuropean migrant crisis, pressure on the asylum reception system, high migratory pressure at the EU\u2019s external border to T\u00fcrkiye and the Western Balkans, threat of arms trafficking and criminal networks due to the war in Ukraine, human smuggling\nFollowing the Tunisian Revolution of 2010\u201311, the government of Italy gave six-month residence permits to some 25,000 Tunisian migrants.[173][174] This allowed the migrants to travel freely in the Schengen Area. In response, both France and Germany threatened to impose border checks, not wanting the Tunisian refugees to enter their territory.[174] In April 2011, for several hours, France blocked trains carrying the migrants at the French/Italian border at Ventimiglia.[174]\nAt the request of France, in May 2011 the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m proposed that more latitude would be available for the temporary re-establishment of border control in the case of strong and unexpected migratory pressure, or the failure of a state to protect the external borders of the EU.[173]\nOn 25 July 2011, in delivering the European Commission's final assessment on the measures taken by Italy and France,[175] the Home Affairs Commissioner said, \"from a formal point of view steps taken by Italian and French authorities have been in compliance with EU law. However, I regret that the spirit of the Schengen rules has not been fully respected\".[175] Ms. Malmstr\u00f6m also called for a more coherent interpretation of the Schengen rules and a stronger evaluation and monitoring system for the Schengen Area.[175]\nDuring the migrant crisis of September 2015, Germany announced it was temporarily bringing border controls back in accordance with the provisions on temporary border controls laid down by the Schengen acquis. Such border controls appear to be an attempt to prevent disorder from making the crisis worse.\nOpen borders appeared to have impeded Germany's ability to provide for very large numbers of persons seeking refuge all at once.\nGermany signals the border controls are only temporary, and only to support an orderly flow of migration into the area.[needs update]\nOther countries, including Austria, Denmark, Slovenia, Hungary, Sweden and Norway have set up border controls in response to the crisis.[176]\nIn December 2015, Sweden passed a temporary law that allows the government to oblige all transport companies to check that their passengers carry valid photographic identification. The new law came into effect on 21 December 2015 and was valid until 21 December 2018.[177] The government decided that the new rules would apply from 4 January 2016 until 4 July 2016. The law led to the mandatory train change and passage through border control at Copenhagen Airport for travelers between Copenhagen and Sweden, and with a reduction in service frequency.[178] Sweden had introduced border control from Denmark earlier (15 November 2015), but that could not stop the migrant flow, since they have the right to apply for asylum once on Swedish ground. First when the transport companies had to stop foreigners on the Danish side, asylum seekers were efficiently stopped. This caused considerable disruption to the train traffic since the railway station did not have capacity for such checks. These checks lasted until 4 May 2017, after the EU commission declared such checks not acceptable.\nOn 30 May 2018, when the migrant crisis border controls were still active in some countries, the European Parliament decided to condemn prolonged border checks between Schengen Area member countries.[179] But this was only a statement as the Parliament does not decide this.\nAlthough some European politicians did call for Europe's internal borders to be temporarily closed,[180] the European Union decided in late February 2020 to turn down the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel area and introducing border controls with Italy.[181][182][183][184][185][186] The deputy leader of the Swiss Ticino League, Lorenzo Quadri, criticised the decision: \"It is alarming that the dogma of wide-open borders is considered a priority.\"[187] United States President Donald Trump said the European Union had \"failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots\" as the U.S. had implemented.[188]\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 stated in early March that \"European countries cannot ban the entry of Italian citizens within the Schengen Area. The only possible way is to have the Italian prime minister call on his fellow citizens to refrain from travelling to other countries of the European Union.\"[189]\nAfter Slovakia, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Poland in mid-March announced complete closure of their national borders, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that \"Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization. Moreover, they have a strong social and economic impact, they disrupt people's lives and business across the borders.\"[190] Von der Leyen also apologised to Italy, amidst widespread discontent among Italians for the lack of solidarity shown by Europe.[191] By the end of March 2020, almost all internal Schengen borders had been closed to non-essential travel. By July 2020, most borders that were closed due to the coronavirus had been reopened.\nParticipating countries are required to apply strict checks on travellers entering and exiting the Schengen Area. These checks are co-ordinated by the European Union's Frontex agency, and subject to common rules. The details of border controls, surveillance and the conditions under which permission to enter into the Schengen Area may be granted are exhaustively detailed in the Schengen Borders Code.[192][193]\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 16 March 2020 the European Commission issued a recommendation to all EU and Schengen member states to introduce a temporary restriction on the entry of third-country nationals (i.e. travellers who are not EEA/Swiss citizens and family members with the right of free movement) to the Schengen Area for non-essential travel for an initial period of 30 days (with the possible prolongation of this period to be assessed based on further developments). However, third-country nationals who are holders of long-term visas or residence permits or are family members of EEA/Swiss citizens are exempt from this restriction. Further, third-country nationals 'with an essential function or need' (such as healthcare workers, transport personnel, aid workers, military personnel, seasonal agricultural workers), passengers in transit, those travelling 'for imperative family reasons' and those 'in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons' are exempt from this restriction. Nevertheless, the European Commission re-iterated that 'coordinated and reinforced health checks' should be carried out on all travellers who are permitted to enter the EU and Schengen Area.[194] All EU (except Ireland) and Schengen member states are now applying this travel restriction.[195]\nFurther, on 30 March 2020, the European Commission published 'Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, on the facilitation of transit arrangements for the repatriation of EU citizens, and on the effects on visa policy' in order to provide 'advice and practical instructions'. The Guidance states that member states are permitted to take measures (such as requiring non-nationals to undergo a period of self-isolation if arriving from a territory affected by COVID-19), provided that the same requirements is imposed on its own nationals. The Guidance also clarifies that citizens of the European micro-states (Andorra, the Holy See, Monaco and San Marino) are exempt from the temporary restriction on the entry of third-country nationals to the European Union and the Schengen Area for non-essential travel. In addition, citizens of Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey should be permitted entry to the European Union and the Schengen Area if they are stranded abroad in order to facilitate repatriation to their country of origin. Third-country nationals (not covered by one of the exemptions from the temporary restriction of entry for non-essential reasons) who seek to enter the Schengen Area will be refused entry at the external border crossing point and will receive a refusal of entry form (with the reason of refusal marked as \"I\" (i.e. a threat to public health)), as well a passport stamp cancelled by an indelible cross in black ink and the letter \"I\" on the right hand side.[196]\nSome EU and Schengen member states have gone further than the European Commission recommendation and have restricted the entry of EEA/Swiss citizens to their respective territories for non-essential travel. For example, on 4 April 2020, French Border Police refused entry to a group of EU and British citizens who arrived in Marseille Provence Airport on a private jet from the UK, with the intention of staying in a holiday villa in Cannes.[197][198]\nOn 8 April 2020, the European Commission invited EU and Schengen member states to extend the restriction on the entry of third-country nationals for non-essential travel for a further period of 30 days until 15 May 2020.[199] On 8 May 2020, the European Commission again invited member states to extend the restriction for another 30 days until 15 June 2020.[200] On 11 June 2020, the European Commission recommended member states to prolong the restriction on the entry of third-country nationals for non-essential travel until 30 June 2020.[201]\nAll persons crossing external borders\u2014inbound or outbound\u2014are subject to a check by a border guard. The only exception is for regular cross-border commuters (both those with the right of free movement and third-country nationals) who are well known to the border guards: once an initial check has shown that there is no alert on record relating to them in the Schengen Information System or national databases, they can only be subject to occasional 'random' checks, rather than systematic checks every time they cross the border.[202][203][204]\nPreviously, EEA and Swiss citizens, as well as their family members enjoying the right of free movement, were subject only to a 'minimum check' when crossing external borders. This meant that their travel document was subject only to a 'rapid' and 'straightforward' visual inspection and an optional check against databases for lost/stolen travel documents. Consultation of the Schengen Information System and other national databases to ensure that the traveller did not represent a security, public policy or health threat was only permitted on a strictly 'non-systematic' basis where such a threat was 'genuine', 'present' and 'sufficiently serious'.[205] In contrast, other travellers were subject to a 'thorough check'.[206]\nHowever, in light of the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, at a meeting of the Council of the European Union on 20 November 2015, interior ministers from the Member States decided to 'implement immediately the necessary systematic and coordinated checks at external borders, including on individuals enjoying the right of free movement'.[207] Amendments were made to the Schengen Border Code to introduce systematic checks of the travel documents of EEA and Swiss citizens, as well as their family members enjoying the right of free movement, against relevant databases when crossing external borders.[208] The new regime came into force on 7 April 2017.\nWhere carrying out systematic checks against databases would have a disproportionate impact on the flow of traffic at an external border, such checks may be relaxed if, on the basis of a risk assessment, it is determined that it would not lead to a security risk.[208][193][how?]\nIn 'exceptional' and 'unforeseen' circumstances where waiting times become excessive, external border checks can be relaxed on a temporary basis.[209][210][example needed]\nBorder guards carry out the following procedures when checking travellers who cross external borders:[208][193]\nProcedure\nEEA/Swiss citizens and family members with right of free movement\nThird-country nationals (on entry)\nThird-country nationals (on exit)\nChecking the traveller's identity based on his/her travel document\nYes\nYes\nYes\nChecking that the travel document is valid and has not expired\nYes\nYes\nYes\nChecking the travel document for signs of falsification or counterfeiting\nChecking the authenticity of the data stored on the RFID chip (if the travel document is biometric)\nOptional\nOptional\nOptional\nChecking the travel document against the list of stolen, misappropriated, lost and invalidated documents in the Schengen Information System, Interpol's SLTD database and other national databases\nYes\nYes\nYes\nConsulting the Schengen Information System and other national databases to ensure that the traveller does not represent a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or international relations of any Schengen Member State\nYes\nOptional (consultation of databases only 'where necessary')\nYes\nRecording the traveller's entry/exit in a database Note that, as of April 2016, only 10 Schengen Member States\u2014Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain\u2014record third-country nationals' entries and exits in their national databases, but data is not exchanged between the national databases of these countries, nor is there a Schengen-wide centralised database tracking entries and exits in all 27 Schengen Member States.[211][212][213][214][215][216][217][218] Only Poland systematically records the entries and exits of EEA and Swiss citizens who are stopped at the border.[219]\nAs shown by the table above, because many procedures are optional, border guards have discretion in deciding how rigorously they check travellers at external border crossing points. As a result, the length of time taken to perform checks differs between Schengen countries. Under the previous regime (whereby those with the right to freedom of movement were subject only to a 'minimum check'), an entry check for an EEA or Swiss citizen took around five seconds on average in Italy, whilst in Norway, on average it took around 1 minute.[217] The disparities in checks on third-country nationals (who are subject to a more thorough check) are even greater. For example, an entry check for an Annex II national takes around 15 seconds on average in Greece, whilst it takes three to five minutes on average in Slovakia.[216][218] Similarly, an entry check for an Annex I national on average lasts around 30\u201360 seconds in the Netherlands, whilst in Latvia, it lasts around two to five minutes on average.[216]\nAfter the new regime came into force on 7 April 2017, significantly longer waiting times were reported at numerous external border crossing points, especially as it was just before the Easter holiday. Travellers entering Slovenia from Croatia (which was not yet part of the Schengen Area) had to wait several hours as Slovenian border guards systematically checked the travel documents of all travellers (including those with the right of free movement) against relevant databases.[223] The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Miro Cerar, acknowledged that the situation was 'unacceptable'. In order to alleviate the long queues, the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases was temporarily suspended from the evening of Friday 7 April 2017 until the end of the weekend.[224][225] However, the following weekend, long queues re-appeared.[226] The Prime Minister of Croatia, Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, criticised the situation, calling it 'unsustainable', and expressed concern about the impact on tourism (which accounts for 18% of Croatia's GDP). The President of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, sent a formal letter to the European Commission to voice her concern about the effect of the new regime on border checks.[227] At a meeting held on 29 April 2017, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, Cerar and Plenkovi\u0107 agreed that, moving forward, the systematic checking of the travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases would be suspended at land border crossing points between Croatia and Slovenia if the waiting time exceeds 15 minutes (with 'targeted checks' being carried out instead).[228] Long queues were also reported at external border crossing points in Greece, where the leadership of the Hellenic Police (which is responsible for border checks) decided to suspend, for a period of 6 months, the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases (with the exception of the Kipoi land border crossing point with Turkey, due to security concerns). Greece was particularly affected by the implementation of the new regime as Greek identity cards are not machine-readable, which meant that border guards had to enter the holder's information manually into the computer system to check the relevant databases if a Greek citizen presented an identity card instead of a passport.[229] Similarly, long waiting times were reported at external border crossing points in France[230] and Spain.[231][232]Finland, Hungary and Italy also issued notifications suspending systematic checks at some external border crossing points.[233] In July 2017, Greece submitted a request to suspend the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases for a further period of 18 months, due to 'infrastructure shortcomings and increased traffic at 12 airports across the country'.[234]\nWhen carrying out checks at external borders, border guards are, by law, required to respect the dignity of travellers (particularly in cases involving vulnerable persons)[235] and are forbidden from discriminating against persons based on their sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.[236]\nExternal border controls are located at roads crossing a border, at airports, at seaports and on board trains.[237] Usually, there is no fence along the land border, but there are exceptions like the Ceuta border fence, and some places at the eastern border.[238] However, surveillance camera systems, some equipped with infrared technology, are located at some more critical spots, for example at the border between Slovakia and Ukraine, where at some points there is a camera every 186 metres (203 yards).[239]\nAll travellers entering and leaving the Schengen Area by general aviation or on a pleasure boat have to make their first point of entry/final point of departure in an airport/aerodrome or a seaport that is designated as an external border crossing point. By way of derogation, travellers on board a pleasure boat are permitted to make their first port of call at a port that is not designated as an external border crossing point if they notify the port authorities and obtain authorisation from the border guards.[240] In practice, however, this is a loophole hard to check, and large-scale drug smuggling using private boats has been uncovered. Along the southern coast of the Schengen countries in the Mediterranean, coast guards make a substantial effort to prevent private boats from entering without permission.\nAt many external border crossing points, there are special lanes for EEA and Swiss citizens (as well as their family members) and other lanes for all travellers regardless of nationality.[241] At some external border crossing points, there is a third type of lane for travellers who are Annex II nationals (i.e. non-EEA/Swiss citizens who are exempt from the visa requirement).[242] Although Andorran and Sammarinese citizens are not EEA citizens, they are nonetheless able to use the special lanes designated for EEA and Swiss citizens.[243] Since 1 January 2021, British citizens are no longer permitted to use the EEA/Swiss lanes.\nSome external border crossing points can only be used by certain travellers. For example, the border checkpoint in Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Slemence, Slovakia (on the border with Ukraine) can only be crossed by pedestrians or cyclists who are EEA, Swiss or Ukrainian citizens.[244] The border checkpoint in Ramoni\u0161kiai, Lithuania (on the border with Russia) can only be crossed by residents of Lithuania and Russia; all other travellers (including EEA and Swiss citizens not resident in Lithuania/Russia) cannot use this border checkpoint.[245] Similarly, the border checkpoint of Pededze-Brunishevo, Latvia (on the border with Russia) is only open to Latvian and Russian citizens.[246] The Narva 2 and Saatse border crossing points in Estonia (on the border with Russia) can only be used by residents of Estonia and Russia.[247] The border checkpoint in Po\u0142owce-Pieszczatka, Poland (on the border with Belarus) can only be crossed by Polish and Belarusian nationals.[248] In 2016, as a temporary measure for 180 days, the two northernmost border checkpoints of Raja-Jooseppi and Salla on the Finland\u2013Russia border could only be crossed by Finnish, Russian and Belarusian citizens (as well as their family members); all other nationals, including non-Finnish EEA and Swiss citizens, were not permitted to use these border checkpoints.[249] Further, the border crossing points of Haapovaara, Inari, Karttimo, Kurvinen, Leminaho and Parikkala (as well as the railway crossing point of Imatra) are only open to Finnish and Russian citizens.[250]\nThe additional obligations imposed by European law on national border authorities when it comes to processing travellers who are third-country nationals (e.g. the obligation to stamp their travel documents) should not prevent the development of automated border control systems which are made available to such travellers. As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated border gates in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, South Korean and United Statesbiometric passports,[251] as well as by the Portuguese Servi\u00e7o de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated border gates in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports. This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of eGates include holders of Australian, Canadian, Israeli, Japanese, New Zealand, Singaporean, South Korean, United States and Vaticanbiometric passports. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch Royal Marechaussee at the Privium iris recognition automated border gates at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (where eligible users include registered EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are Global Entry members, and all nationals who are holders of diplomatic passports), as well as by the German Federal Police at the ABG Plus iris recognition automated border gates at Frankfurt Airport (where eligible users include registered EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are Global Entry members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped.[252] At the Port of Helsinki, the Finnish Border Guard has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include Russian citizens (who, as Annex I nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.[251]\nIn November 2016 the European Commission proposed a system for an electronic authorisation of visa-exempt third country nationals called ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System).[255] Foreign visitors will be required to submit personal data in advance and pay a processing fee (fee is waived for children). The application is to be done over the internet and need to be made a few days before travel. The authorisation will be valid for three years. It is imagined as a system similar to the ESTA system of the United States and the ETA system of Canada. ETIAS is scheduled to enter into operation by May 2025.[256]\nETIAS requirements will, in general, apply to those third country nationals who are not required to have a visa and have no residence permit or similar.\nSchengen rules require that all carriers conveying passengers across the Schengen external border must check, before boarding, that passengers have the correct travel documents and visas required for entry.[257] Carriers that transport third-country nationals without the correct travel documents are imposed with financial penalties and are required to transport those refused entry back to the point of departure.[258] The aim of this measure is to prevent illegal immigration. Further, since immigrants have the right to apply for asylum at border control at ports of entry in the EU, though such applications must be made in person in the country where asylum status is sought, this measure has the effect of preventing prospective asylum seekers from boarding public transportation to the Schengen Area (unless they have already obtained a Schengen visa or are visa-exempt).\nThe rules applicable to short-term entry visas into the Schengen Area are set out in EU regulations which contain two lists: a list of the nationalities (or classes of travel document holder) which require a visa for a short-term stay (the Annex I list) and a list which do not (the Annex II list).[259]\nBeing listed in the visa-free list will sometimes but not always exempt the listed nationality or class from the requirement to obtain a work permit if they wish to take up employment or self-employed activity during their stay; business trips are not normally considered employment in this sense.[260]\nAn application for a Schengen visa should be submitted to the embassy or consulate of the country which the traveller intends to visit. If a traveller plans to visit multiple countries in the Schengen Area, the application should be submitted to the embassy or consulate of the main destination. If the main destination cannot be determined, the traveller should apply for the visa at the embassy or consulate of the Schengen member state of first entry.[261] Often, external service providers are contracted by certain diplomatic missions to process, collect and return visa applications.[262]\nThe standard application fee for a Schengen visa is EUR 80. There is a reduced visa application fee of EUR 40 for children aged 6 to 12. The visa application fee is waived for children under the age of 6. Where an application is submitted to an external service provider, an additional service fee may have to be paid. The visa application fee (and the additional service fee, if applicable) are not refundable regardless of the outcome of the application.[263]\nA Schengen visa or a visa exemption does not entitle the traveller to enter the Schengen Area, but rather allows the traveller to seek entry at the border crossing point. The Schengen Borders Code lists requirements which third-country nationals must meet to be allowed into the Schengen Area. For this purpose, a third-country national is a person who does not enjoy the right of free movement (i.e. a person who is not an EEA citizen or Swiss, nor a family member of such a person).\nThe entry requirements for third country nationals who intend to stay in the Schengen Area for not more than 90 days in any 180-day period are as follows:[264]\nThe traveller is in possession of a valid travel document or documents authorising them to cross the border (a visa is not considered a travel document in this sense); the acceptance of travel documents for this purpose remains within the domain of the member states;[265]\nThe travel document must be valid for at least 3 months after the intended date of departure from the Schengen Area (although in a justified case of emergency, this obligation may be waived) and must have been issued within the previous 10 years;[266]\nThe traveller either possesses a valid visa (if required) or a valid residence permit;\nThe traveller can justify the purpose and conditions of the intended stay and has sufficient means of subsistence, both for the duration of the intended stay and for the return to his or her country of origin or transit to a third country into which the traveller is certain to be admitted, or is in a position to acquire such means lawfully;\nThe traveller is not considered to be a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Schengen states.\nHowever, even if the third-country national does not fulfil the criteria for entry, admission may still be granted:[267]\nOn humanitarian grounds\nOn grounds of national interests\nOn grounds of international obligations\nIf the person is not in possession of a visa, but fulfils the criteria for being issued a visa at the border\nIf the person holds a residence permit or a re-entry visa issued by a Schengen state\nBorder guards are required to stamp the travel documents of third-country nationals when they cross external borders.[268] However, nationals of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City are exempt from this requirement, as are heads of state, whose visits were announced through diplomatic channels, and holders of local border traffic permits and residence permits issued by a Schengen member state.[269][270] Certain exemptions also apply to the crews of ships and aircraft.[271] Third-country nationals who otherwise fulfil all the criteria for admission into the Schengen Area must not be denied entry for the sole reason that there is no remaining empty space in their travel document to affix a stamp; instead, the stamp should be affixed on a separate sheet of paper.[272]\nFor stays in the Schengen Area as a whole which exceed 90 days, a third-country national will need to hold either a long-stay visa for a period no longer than a year, or a residence permit for longer periods. A long-stay visa is a national visa but is issued in accordance with a uniform format. It entitles the holder to enter the Schengen Area and remain in the issuing state for a period longer than 90 days but no more than one year. If a Schengen state wishes to allow the holder of a long-stay visa to remain there for longer than a year, the state must issue him or her with a residence permit.\nThe holder of a long-stay visa or a residence permit is entitled to move freely within other states which compose the Schengen Area for a period of up to three months in any half-year.[273] Third-country nationals who are long-term residents in a Schengen state may also acquire the right to move to and settle in another Schengen state without losing their legal status and social benefits.[274]\nAsylum seekers who request international protection under the Geneva Convention from a Schengen member state are not issued a residence permit, but are instead issued, within three days of the application being lodged, an authorisation to remain on the territory of the member state while the application is pending or being examined. This means that, whilst their application for refugee status is being processed, asylum seekers are only permitted to remain in the Schengen member state where they have claimed asylum and are not entitled to move freely within other states which compose the Schengen Area.[275] Successful applicants who have been granted international protection by a Schengen member state are issued residence permits which are valid for at least three years and renewable, whilst applicants granted subsidiary protection by a Schengen member state are issued residence permits valid for at least 1-year and renewable, unless there are compelling reasons relating to national security or public order. Family members of beneficiaries of international or subsidiary protection from a Schengen member state are issued residence permits as well, but their validity can be shorter.[276] Applicants who have been granted temporary protection by a Schengen member state (as well as their reunited family members) are issued residence permits valid for the entire period of temporary protection.[277]\nHowever, some third-country nationals are permitted to stay in the Schengen Area for more than 90 days without the need to apply for a long-stay visa. For example, France does not require citizens of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City to apply for a long-stay visa.[278] In addition, Article 20(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement allows for this 'in exceptional circumstances' and for bilateral agreements concluded by individual signatory states with other countries before the Convention entered into force to remain applicable. As a result, for example, New Zealand citizens are permitted to stay for up to 90 days in each of the Schengen countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) which had already concluded bilateral visa exemption agreements with the New Zealand Government prior to the Convention entering into force without the need to apply for long-stay visas, but if travelling to other Schengen countries the 90 days in a 180-day period time limit applies.[279][280][281][282][283][284][285][286][287][288][289][excessive citations]\nHolders of a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen issued by a Schengen member state can travel to another Schengen member state without a visa, regardless of whether they are travelling independently, or accompanying or joining their EEA/Swiss citizen family member. However, holders of a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen issued by Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland, and the UK can travel to the Schengen Area without a visa only if they are accompanying or joining their EEA/Swiss citizen family member.[295] British citizens had until 30 June 2021 to apply for the card.\nHowever, as of December 2008, the right of entry of family members of EEA/Swiss citizens laid down in Articles 5(2) and 5(4) of Directive 2004/38/EC has been incorrectly transposed into Belgian, Latvian and Swedish law, and not transposed at all by Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Lithuania, Germany and Slovenia.[297] Five member states do not follow the Directive to the effect that non-EEA family members may still face difficulties (denial of boarding the vessel by the transport company, denial to enter by border police) when travelling to those states using their residence card issued by another EU member state. A visa or other document(s) may still be required.[297]\nExternal Schengen or EU borders which have local border traffic permits.\nSchengen states which share an external land border with a non-EU member state are authorised by virtue of the EU Regulation 1931/2006 to conclude or maintain bilateral agreements with neighbouring third countries for the purpose of implementing a local border traffic regime.[298] Such agreements define a border area which may extend to a maximum of 50 kilometres (31 mi) on either side of the border, and provide for the issuance of local border traffic permits to residents of the border area. Permits may be used to cross the EU external border within the border area, are not stamped on crossing the border and must display the holder's name and photograph, as well as a statement that its holder is not authorised to move outside the border area and that any abuse shall be subject to penalties.\nPermits are issued with a validity period of between one and five years and allow for a stay in the border area of up to three months. Permits may only be issued to lawful residents of the border area who have been resident in the border area for a minimum of one year (or longer if specified by the bilateral agreement). Applicants for a permit have to show that they have legitimate reasons to cross frequently an external land border under the local border traffic regime. Schengen states must keep a central register of the permits issued and have to provide immediate access to the relevant data to other Schengen states.\nHolders of local border traffic permits are able to spend up to 3 months every time they enter the border area of the country which has issued the permit (this time limit is far more generous than the \"90 days in a 180-day period\" normally granted to third-country nationals visiting the Schengen Area).[299]\nBefore the conclusion of an agreement with a neighbouring country, the Schengen state must receive approval from the European Commission, which has to confirm that the draft agreement is in conformity with the Regulation. The agreement may only be concluded if the neighbouring state grants at least reciprocal rights to EEA and Swiss nationals resident on the Schengen side of the border area, and agrees to the repatriation of individuals found to be abusing the border agreement.\nAs of June 2017[update] ten local-traffic agreements have come into force.\nAn agreement between Croatia\u2013Bosnia and Herzegovina is applied on provisional basis, pending ratification.[302]\nOn 28 April 2014, Moldova was classified as an 'Annex II' nationality. On 11 June 2017, Ukraine was classified as an 'Annex II' nationality. Therefore, Moldovan and Ukrainian citizens who hold biometric passports no longer require a visa to enter the Schengen Area and Romania, thus obviating the need to apply for a local border traffic permit (unless they wish to spend more than 90 days in a 180-day period permitted by the visa exemption, given that local border traffic permit holders are allowed to stay for 3 months in the border area on each entry).\nThere are or have been plans for Lithuania\u2013Russia, Poland\u2013Belarus, Bulgaria\u2013Serbia and Bulgaria\u2013North Macedonia local border traffic agreements.[306]\nThe agreement between Poland and Belarus had been due to enter into force by 2012,[307] but was delayed by Belarus,[308] with no implementation date set (as of Oct 2012).[309]\nIn late 2009, Norway began issuing one-year multiple-entry visas, without the usual requirement of having family or a business partner in Norway, called Pomor-Visas, to Russians from Murmansk Oblast, and later to those from Arkhangelsk Oblast.[310] Finland is not planning border permits, but has issued over one million regular visas for Russians in 2011, and many of them multiple-entry visas. The EU was planning to allow up to 5-year validity on multiple-entry visas for Russians.[311]\nThere is also a similar system for local border traffic permits between Spain and Morocco regarding Ceuta and Melilla. This system is older and was included in the 1991 accession treaty of Spain to the Schengen Area.[55] In this case there are identity checks for anyone travelling to other parts of the Schengen Area (possible by boat and air only). Such checks are not the rule for other local border traffic zones.\nCitizens of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia can enter the Schengen Area without a visa. On 30 November 2009, the EU Council of Ministers for Interior and Justice abolished visa requirements for citizens of Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia,[312] while on 8 November 2010 it did the same for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.[313] The former took effect on 19 December 2009,[259] and the latter on 15 December 2010.[314]\nVisa liberalisation negotiations between the EU and the Western Balkans (excluding Kosovo) were launched in the first half of 2008, and ended in 2009 (for Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) and 2010 (for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina). Before visas were fully abolished, the Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) had signed \"visa facilitation agreements\" with the Schengen states in 2008. The visa facilitation agreements were, at the time, supposed to shorten waiting periods, lower visa fees (including free visas for certain categories of travellers), and reduce paperwork. In practice, however, the new procedures turned out to be longer, more cumbersome, more expensive, and many people complained that it was easier to obtain visas before the facilitation agreements entered into force.[315][316][317]\nThe European Commission launched a visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo on 19 January 2012. In June 2012, the Commission handed over a roadmap on visa liberalisation to the Kosovo authorities, which identified the legislation and institutional measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation. On 4 May 2016, the European Commission proposed visa-free travel for the citizens of Kosovo. The European Commission has proposed to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament to lift the visa requirements for the people of Kosovo by transferring Kosovo to the visa-free list for short-stays in the Schengen Area. The EU approved the visa exemption for nationals of Kosovo, effective from 1 January 2024.\nTo counter the potentially aggravating effects of the abolition of border controls on undocumented immigration and cross-border crime, the Schengen acquis contains compensatory police and judicial measures.[318] Chief among these is the Schengen Information System (SIS),[318] a database operated by all EU and Schengen states and which by January 2010 contained in excess of 30 million entries and by January 2014 contained in excess of 50 million entries, according to a document published in June 2015 by the Council of the European Union.[319] Around 1 million of the entries relate to persons, 72% of which were not allowed to enter and stay in the Schengen Area. Only 7% of persons listed on the SIS database were missing persons.\nThe vast majority of data entries on the SIS, around 49 million, concern lost or stolen objects. The European Council reports that in 2013 an average of 43 stolen vehicles a day were detected by authorities using the SIS database.[319]\nThe Schengen Agreement also allows police officers from one participating state to follow suspects across borders both in hot pursuit[322] and to continue observation operations, and for enhanced mutual assistance in criminal matters.[323]\nThe Schengen Convention also contained measures intended to streamline extradition between participating countries however these have now been subsumed into the European Arrest Warrant system.[324]\nThe legal basis for Schengen in the treaties of the European Union has been inserted in the Treaty establishing the European Community through Article 2, point 15 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. This inserted a new title named \"Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons\" into the treaty, currently numbered as Title IV, and comprising articles 61 to 69.[325] The Treaty of Lisbon substantially amends the provisions of the articles in the title, renames the title to \"Area of freedom, security and justice\" and divides it into five chapters, called \"General provisions\", \"Policies on border checks, asylum and immigration\", \"Judicial cooperation in civil matters\", \"Judicial cooperation in criminal matters\", and \"Police cooperation\".[326]\nThe Schengen Area originally had its legal basis outside the then European Economic Community, having been established by a sub-set of member states of the Community using two international agreements:\nThe 1985 Schengen Agreement \u2013 Agreement between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders.\nThe 1990 Schengen Convention \u2013 Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders.\n^The United Kingdom, the administering power, considers that the area of Gibraltar is 6.8km2, while for Spain it is 6.7km2.[107] However, the various extensions using land reclaimed from the sea have in practice increased it to 6.8km2.\n^\"Frequently asked questions\". europa.eu.

The 1982 Declaration provides: 'As to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the terms \"nationals\", \"nationals of Member States\" or \"nationals of Member States and overseas countries and territories\", wherever used in the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community or the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community or in any of the Community acts deriving from those Treaties, are to be understood to refer to: (a) British citizens; (b) Persons who are British subjects by virtue of Part IV of the British Nationality Act 1981 and who have the right of abode in the United Kingdom and are therefore exempt from United Kingdom immigration control; (c) British Dependent Territories citizens who acquire their citizenship from a connection with Gibraltar.\n^\"Press Conference of HM Government of Gibraltar\".

[...] Today a non-Gibraltar resident who is a British citizen has to show his passport and has to be given entry by the BCA, because they come into Gibraltar.

Instead, the border guard should check the validity of the residence permit. (See Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of the provisions on stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals in accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (COM (2009) 489, p. 7), \"The Commission is of the opinion that travel documents of third-country nationals who are in possession of a valid residence permit issued by a Schengen Member State should not be stamped. The purpose of stamping a passport serves to establish whether a third country national respected the authorised length of a short stay within the Schengen area. This logic cannot be applied to third country nationals holding a valid residence permit, as the allowed period of stay in the Schengen Member State which issued the permit is determined by the validity of the residence permit.\")\n^ abcSome Schengen member states have exempted certain categories of travellers who are subject to a thorough check from the requirement to demonstrate sufficient funds for his/her stay, proof of onward/return journey and explaining his/her purpose of stay to the border guard at external border crossing points.

        "context": "\nAl-Qaeda only indirectly controls its day-to-day operations. Its philosophy calls for the centralization of decision making, while allowing for the decentralization of execution.[91] The top leaders of Al-Qaeda have defined the organization's ideology and guiding strategy, and they have also articulated simple and easy-to-receive messages. At the same time, mid-level organizations were given autonomy, but they had to consult with top management before large-scale attacks and assassinations. Top management included the shura council as well as committees on military operations, finance, and information sharing. Through the information committees of Al-Qaeda, Zawahiri placed special emphasis on communicating with his groups.[92] However, after the war on terror, Al-Qaeda's leadership has become isolated. As a result, the leadership has become decentralized, and the organization has become regionalized into several Al-Qaeda groups.[93][94]\nMany Western analysts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by Al-Qaeda's leadership. However, bin Laden held considerable ideological influence over revolutionary Islamist movements across the world. Experts argue that Al-Qaeda has fragmented into a number of disparate regional movements, and that these groups bear little connection with one another.[95]\nThis view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with Tayseer Allouni:\nthis matter isn't about any specific person and... is not about the al-Qa'idah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one... and all the true believers [mu'mineen] are brothers. So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an 'organization' with a specific name (such as 'al-Qa'idah') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called 'The Base' ['Al-Qa'idah'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren't separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east, from the Philippines to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation.[96]\nAs of 2010[update] however, Bruce Hoffman saw Al-Qaeda as a cohesive network that was strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas.[95]\nOsama bin Laden served as the emir of Al-Qaeda from the organization's founding in 1988 until his assassination by US forces on May 1, 2011.[107]Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011.[108]\nBin Laden was advised by a Shura Council, which consists of senior Al-Qaeda members.[109] The group was estimated to consist of 20\u201330 people.\nAyman al-Zawahiri had been Al-Qaeda's deputy emir and assumed the role of emir following bin Laden's death. Al-Zawahiri replaced Saif al-Adel, who had served as interim commander.[110]\nOn June 5, 2012, Pakistani intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman's alleged successor as second in command, Abu Yahya al-Libi, had been killed in Pakistan.[111]\nNasir al-Wuhayshi was alleged to have become Al-Qaeda's overall second in command and general manager in 2013. He was concurrently the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) until he was killed by a US airstrike in Yemen in June 2015.[112]Abu Khayr al-Masri, Wuhayshi's alleged successor as the deputy to Ayman al-Zawahiri, was killed by a US airstrike in Syria in February 2017.[113] Al Qaeda's next alleged number two leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, was killed by Israeli agents. His pseudonym was Abu Muhammad al-Masri, who was killed in November 2020 in Iran. He was involved in the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.[114]\nAl-Qaeda's network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network which drew upon the leadership of a number of regional nodes.[115] The organization divided itself into several committees, which include:\nThe Military Committee, which is responsible for training operatives, acquiring weapons, and planning attacks.\nThe Money/Business Committee, which funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the hawala banking system. US-led efforts to eradicate the sources of \"terrorist financing\"[116] were most successful in the year immediately following the September 11 attacks.[117] Al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so hawaladars in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to US$10million.[118] The committee also procures false passports, pays Al-Qaeda members, and oversees profit-driven businesses.[119] In the 9/11 Commission Report, it was estimated that Al-Qaeda required $30million per year to conduct its operations.\nThe Law Committee reviews Sharia law, and decides upon courses of action conform to it.\nThe Islamic Study/Fatwah Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans.\nIn 2005, Al-Qaeda formed As-Sahab, a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials.\nAl-Zawahiri was killed on July 31, 2022 in a drone strike in Afghanistan.[120] In February 2023, a report from the United Nations, based on member state intelligence, concluded that de facto leadership of Al-Qaeda had passed to Saif al-Adel, who was operating out of Iran. Adel, a former Egyptian army officer, became a military instructor in Al-Qaeda camps in the 1990s and was known for his involvement in the Battle of Mogadishu. The report stated that al-Adel's leadership could not officially be declared by al-Qaeda because of \"political sensitivities\" of Afghan government in acknowledging the death of Al-Zawahiri as well as due to \"theological and operational\" challenges posed by the location of al-Adel in Iran.[121][122]\nMost of Al Qaeda's top leaders and operational directors were veterans who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were the leaders who were considered the operational commanders of the organization.[123] Nevertheless, Al-Qaeda is not operationally managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri. Several operational groups exist, which consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation.[124] Al-Qaeda central (AQC) is a conglomerate of expert committees, each in supervision of distinct tasks and objectives. Its membership is mostly composed of Egyptian Islamist leaders who participated in the anti-communistAfghan Jihad. Assisting them are hundreds of Islamic field operatives and commanders, based in various regions of the Muslim World. The central leadership assumes control of the doctrinal approach and overall propaganda campaign; while the regional commanders were empowered with independence in military strategy and political maneuvering. This novel hierarchy made it possible for the organisation to launch wide-range offensives.[125]\nWhen asked in 2005 about the possibility of Al-Qaeda's connection to the July 7, 2005 London bombings, Metropolitan Police CommissionerSir Ian Blair said: \"Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working... but this has the hallmark of that approach... Al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training... to provide expertise... and I think that is what has occurred here.\"[126] On August 13, 2005, The Independent newspaper, reported that the July7 bombers had acted independently of an Al-Qaeda mastermind.[127]\nNasser al-Bahri, who was Osama bin Laden's bodyguard for four years in the run-up to 9/11 wrote in his memoir a highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time. Al-Bahri described Al-Qaeda's formal administrative structure and vast arsenal.[128] However, the author Adam Curtis argued that the idea of Al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contended the name \"Al-Qaeda\" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa. Curtis wrote:\nThe reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term \"al-Qaeda\" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it.[129]\nDuring the 2001 trial, the US Department of Justice needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him in absentia under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin Laden.[130] Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack US military establishments.[131][132] Sam Schmidt, a defense attorney who defended al-Fadl said:\nThere were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.[129]\nThe number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core Al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170.[133] In 2006, it was estimated that Al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 countries.[134] As of 2009[update], it was believed that no more than 200\u2013300 members were still active commanders.[135]\nAccording to the 2004 BBC documentary The Power of Nightmares, Al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted Al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of Al-Qaeda existed.[136] Al-Qaeda's commanders, as well as its sleeping agents, are hiding in different parts of the world to this day. They are mainly hunted by the American and Israeli secret services.\nAccording to author Robert Cassidy, Al-Qaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was \"organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces\" in the Soviet\u2013Afghan war.[134] The force was composed primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad. Another group, which numbered 10,000 in 2006, live in the West and have received rudimentary combat training.[134]\nOther analysts have described Al-Qaeda's rank and file as being \"predominantly Arab\" in its first years of operation, but that the organization also includes \"other peoples\" as of 2007[update].[137] It has been estimated that 62 percent of Al-Qaeda members have a university education.[138] In 2011 and the following year, the Americans successfully settled accounts with Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki, the organization's chief propagandist, and Abu Yahya al-Libi's deputy commander. The optimistic voices were already saying it was over for Al-Qaeda. Nevertheless, it was around this time that the Arab Spring greeted the region, the turmoil of which came great to Al-Qaeda's regional forces. Seven years later, Ayman al-Zawahiri became arguably the number one leader in the organization, implementing his strategy with systematic consistency. Tens of thousands loyal to Al-Qaeda and related organizations were able to challenge local and regional stability and ruthlessly attack their enemies in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and Russia alike. In fact, from Northwest Africa to South Asia, Al-Qaeda had more than two dozen \"franchise-based\" allies. The number of Al-Qaeda militants was set at 20,000 in Syria alone, and they had 4,000 members in Yemen and about 7,000 in Somalia. The war was not over.[139]\nIn 2001, Al-Qaeda had around 20 functioning cells and 70,000 insurgents spread over sixty nations.[140] According to latest estimates, the number of active-duty soldiers under its command and allied militias have risen to approximately 250,000 by 2018.[141]\nAl-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.[142] In the 1990s, financing came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden.[143] Other sources of income included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic Gulf states.[143] A WikiLeaks-released 2009 internal US government cable stated that \"terrorist funding emanating from Saudi Arabia remains a serious concern.\"[144]\nAmong the first pieces of evidence regarding Saudi Arabia's support for Al-Qaeda was the so-called \"Golden Chain\", a list of early Al-Qaeda funders seized during a 2002 raid in Sarajevo by Bosnian police.[145] The hand-written list was validated by Al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl, and included the names of both donors and beneficiaries.[145][146] Osama bin-Laden's name appeared seven times among the beneficiaries, while 20 Saudi and Gulf-based businessmen and politicians were listed among the donors.[145] Notable donors included Adel Batterjee, and Wael Hamza Julaidan. Batterjee was designated as a terror financier by the US Department of the Treasury in 2004, and Julaidan is recognized as one of Al-Qaeda's founders.[145]\nDocuments seized during the 2002 Bosnia raid showed that Al-Qaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe.[147] Notably, this activity exploited the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and the Muslim World League (MWL). The IIRO had ties with Al-Qaeda associates worldwide, including Al-Qaeda's deputy Ayman al Zawahiri. Zawahiri's brother worked for the IIRO in Albania and had actively recruited on behalf of Al-Qaeda.[148] The MWL was openly identified by Al-Qaeda's leader as one of the three charities Al-Qaeda primarily relied upon for funding sources.[148]\nSeveral Qatari citizens have been accused of funding Al-Qaeda. This includes Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, a Qatari citizen and a human-rights activist who founded the Swiss-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Alkarama. On December 18, 2013, the US Treasury designated Nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting Al-Qaeda.[149] The US Treasury has said Nuaimi \"has facilitated significant financial support to Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Qatar-based donors\".[149]\nNuaimi was accused of overseeing a $2million monthly transfer to Al-Qaeda in Iraq as part of his role as mediator between Iraq-based Al-Qaeda senior officers and Qatari citizens.[149][150] Nuaimi allegedly entertained relationships with Abu-Khalid al-Suri, Al-Qaeda's top envoy in Syria, who processed a $600,000 transfer to Al-Qaeda in 2013.[149][150] Nuaimi is also known to be associated with Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, a Yemeni politician and founding member of Alkarama, who was listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the US Treasury in 2013.[151] The US authorities claimed that Humayqani exploited his role in Alkarama to fundraise on behalf of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).[149][151] A prominent figure in AQAP, Nuaimi was also reported to have facilitated the flow of funding to AQAP affiliates based in Yemen. Nuaimi was also accused of investing funds in the charity directed by Humayqani to ultimately fund AQAP.[149] About ten months after being sanctioned by the US Treasury, Nuaimi was also restrained from doing business in the UK.[152]\nAnother Qatari citizen, Kalifa Mohammed Turki Subayi, was sanctioned by the US Treasury on June 5, 2008, for his activities as a \"Gulf-based Al-Qaeda financier\". Subayi's name was added to the UN Security Council's Sanctions List in 2008 on charges of providing financial and material support to Al-Qaeda senior leadership.[150][153] Subayi allegedly moved Al-Qaeda recruits to South Asia-based training camps.[150][153] He also financially supported Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani national and senior Al-Qaeda officer who is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11 attack according to the 9/11 Commission Report.[154]\nQataris provided support to al-Qaeda through the country's largest NGO, the Qatar Charity. Al-Qaeda defector al-Fadl, who was a former member of Qatar Charity, testified in court that Abdullah Mohammed Yusef, who served as Qatar Charity's director, was affiliated to Al-Qaeda and simultaneously to the National Islamic Front, a political group that gave al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden harbor in Sudan in the early 1990s.[146]\nIt was alleged that in 1993 Osama bin Laden was using Middle East based Sunni charities to channel financial support to Al-Qaeda operatives overseas. The same documents also report Bin Laden's complaint that the failed assassination attempt of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had compromised the ability of Al-Qaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent it was capable of before 1995.[citation needed]\nQatar financed Al-Qaeda's enterprises through Al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra. The funding was primarily channeled through kidnapping for ransom.[155] The Consortium Against Terrorist Finance (CATF) reported that the Gulf country has funded al-Nusra since 2013.[155] In 2017, Asharq Al-Awsat estimated that Qatar had disbursed $25million in support of al-Nusra through kidnapping for ransom.[156] In addition, Qatar has launched fundraising campaigns on behalf of al-Nusra. Al-Nusra acknowledged a Qatar-sponsored campaign \"as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group\".[157][158]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(August 2016)\nIn the disagreement over whether Al-Qaeda's objectives are religious or political, Mark Sedgwick describes Al-Qaeda's strategy as political in the immediate term but with ultimate aims that are religious.[159]\nOn March 11, 2005, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Saif al-Adel's document \"Al Qaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020\".[8][160]Abdel Bari Atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the Ummah from all forms of oppression:\nProvoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on US soil that results in massive civilian casualties.\nIncite local resistance to occupying forces.\nExpand the conflict to neighboring countries and engage the US and its allies in a long war of attrition.\nConvert Al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the US and countries allied with the US until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the 2004 Madrid train bombings, but which did not have the same effect with the July 7, 2005 London bombings.\nThe US economy will finally collapse by 2020, under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places. This will lead to a collapse in the worldwide economic system, and lead to global political instability. This will lead to a global jihad led by Al-Qaeda, and a WahhabiCaliphate will then be installed across the world.\nAccording to Fouad Hussein, a Jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with Al-Zarqawi, Al-Qaeda's strategy consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in Al Qaeda's Strategy to the year 2020. These phases include:[161]\n\"The Awakening.\" This phase was supposed to last from 2001 to 2003. The goal of the phase is to provoke the United States to attack a Muslim country by executing an attack that kills many civilians on US soil.\n\"Opening Eyes.\" This phase was supposed to last from 2003 to 2006. The goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the Al-Qaeda group into a movement. Iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states.\n\"Arising and Standing up\", was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010. In this phase, Al-Qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on Syria. Hussein believed other countries in the Arabian Peninsula were also in danger.\nAl-Qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the Arabian Peninsula. The main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and cyberterrorism, targeting the US economy and military infrastructure.\nThe declaration of an Islamic Caliphate, which was projected between 2013 and 2016. In this phase, Al-Qaeda expected the resistance from Israel to be heavily reduced.\nThe declaration of an \"Islamic Army\" and a \"fight between believers and non-believers\", also called \"total confrontation\".\n\"Definitive Victory\", projected to be completed by 2020.\nAccording to the seven-phase strategy, the war is projected to last less than two years.\nAccording to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute and Katherine Zimmerman of the American Enterprise Institute, the new model of Al-Qaeda is to \"socialize communities\" and build a broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities, also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks.[162]\nThe doctrinal concept of \"Al-Qaeda\" was first coined by the PalestinianIslamist scholar and Jihadist leader Abdullah Azzam in an April 1988 issue of Al-Jihad magazine to describe a religiously committed vanguard of Muslims who wage armed Jihad globally to liberate oppressed Muslims from foreign invaders, establish sharia (Islamic law) across the Islamic World by overthrowing the ruling secular governments; and thus restore the past Islamic prowess. This was to be implemented by establishing an Islamic state that would nurture generations of Muslim soldiers that would perpetually attack United States and its allied governments in the Muslim World. Numerous historical models were cited by Azzam as successful examples of his call; starting from the early Muslim conquests of the 7th century to the recent anti-SovietAfghan Jihad of 1980s.[165][166][167] According to Azzam's world-view:\nIt is about time to think about a state that would be a solid base for the distribution of the (Islamic) creed, and a fortress to host the preachers from the hell of the Jahiliyyah [the pre-Islamic period].[167]\nBin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with Al Jazeera journalist Tayseer Alouni in October 2001:\nThe name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia's terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.[168]\nIt has been argued that two documents seized from the Sarajevo office of the Benevolence International Foundation prove the name was not simply adopted by the mujahideen movement and that a group called Al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term \"Al-Qaeda\".[169]\nFormer British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote that the word Al-Qaeda should be translated as \"the database\", because it originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.[170] In April 2002, the group assumed the name Qa'idat al-Jihad (\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062fq\u0101\u02bfidat al-jih\u0101d), which means \"the base of Jihad\". According to Diaa Rashwan, this was \"apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's al-Jihad, which was led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.\"[171]\nThe militant IslamistSalafist movement of Al-Qaeda developed during the Islamic revival and the rise of the Islamist movement after the Iranian Revolution (1978\u20131979) and the Afghan Jihad (1979\u20131989). Many scholars have argued that the writings of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb inspired the Al-Qaeda organization.[172] In the 1950s and 1960s, Qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, and had reverted to the pre-Islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah. To restore Islam, Qutb argued that a vanguard of righteous Muslims was needed in order to establish \"true Islamic states\", implement sharia, and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences. In Qutb's view, the enemies of Islam included \"world Jewry\", which \"plotted conspiracies\" and opposed Islam.[173] Qutb envisioned this vanguard to march forward to wage armed Jihad against tyrannical regimes after purifying from the wider Jahili societies and organising themselves under a righteous Islamic leadership; which he viewed as the model of early Muslims in the Islamic state of Medina under the leadership of Islamic Prophet Muhammad. This idea would directly influence many Islamist figures such as Abdullah Azzam and Usama Bin Laden; and became the core rationale for the formulation of \"Al-Qaeda\" concept in the near future.[174] Outlining his strategy to topple the existing secular orders, Qutb argued in Milestones:\n[It is necessary that] a Muslim community to come into existence which believes that \u2018there is no deity except God,\u2019 which commits itself to obey none but God, denying all other authority, and which challenges the legality of any law which is not based on this belief.. . It should come into the battlefield with the determination that its strategy, its social organization, and the relationship between its individuals should be firmer and more powerful than the existing jahili system.[174][175]\nIslam is different from any other religion; it's a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.[176]\nQutb also influenced Ayman al-Zawahiri.[177] Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, prot\u00e9g\u00e9, personal lawyer, and an executor of his estate. Azzam was one of the last people to see Qutb alive before his execution.[178] Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet's Banner.[179]\nQutb argued that many Muslims were not true Muslims. Some Muslims, Qutb argued, were apostates. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce sharia law.[180] He also alleged that the West approaches the Muslim World with a \"crusading spirit\"; in spite of the decline of religious values in the 20th century Europe. According to Qutb; the hostile and imperialist attitudes exhibited by Europeans and Americans towards Muslim countries, their support for Zionism, etc. reflected hatred amplified over a millennia of wars such as the Crusades and was born out of Romanmaterialist and utilitarian outlooks that viewed the world in monetary terms.[181]\nSayyid Ahmed's revival of the ideology of jihad became the prototype for subsequent Islamic militant movements in South and Central Asia and is also the main influence over the jihad network of Al Qaeda and its associated groups in the region.[183][184]\nThe long-term objective of Al-Qaeda is to unite the Muslim World under a supra-national Islamic state known as the Khilafah (Caliphate), headed by an elected Caliph descended from the Ahl al-Bayt (Prophetic family). The immediate objectives include the expulsion of American troops from the Arabian Peninsula, waging armed Jihad to topple US-allied governments in the region, etc.[185][186]\nThe following are the goals and some of the general policies outlined in Al-Qaeda's Founding Charter \"Al-Qaeda's Structure and Bylaws\" issued in the meetings in Peshawar in 1988.:[187][185]\n\"General Goals\ni. To promote jihad awareness in the Islamic world\nii. To prepare and equip the cadres for the Islamic world through trainings and by participating in actual combat\niii. To support and sponsor the jihad movement as much as possible\niv. To coordinate Jihad movements around the world in an effort to create a unified international Jihad movement.\nGeneral Policies\n1. Complete commitment to the governing rules and controls of Shari\u2018a in all the beliefs and actions and according to the book [Qur\u2019an] and Sunna as well as per the interpretation of the nation\u2019s scholars who serve in this domain\n2. Commitment to Jihad as a fight for God\u2019s cause and as an agenda of change and to prepare for it and apply it whenever we find it possible...\n4. Our position with respect to the tyrants of the world, secular and national parties and the like is not to associate with them, to discredit them and to be their constant enemy till they believe in God alone. We shall not agree with them on half-solutions and there is no way to negotiate with them or appease them\n5. Our relationships with truthful Islamic jihadist movements and groups is to cooperate under the umbrella of faith and belief and we shall always attempt to at uniting and integrating with them...\n6. We shall carry a relationship of love and affection with the Islamic movements who are not aligned with Jihad...\n7. We shall sustain a relationship of respect and love with active scholars...\n9. We shall reject the regional fanatics and will pursue Jihad in an Islamic country as needed and when possible\n10. We shall care about the role of Muslim people in the Jihad and we shall attempt to recruit them...\n11. We shall maintain our economic independence and will not rely on others to secure our resources.\n12. Secrecy is the main ingredient of our work except for what the need deems necessary to reveal\n13. our policy with the Afghani Jihad is support, advise and coordination with the Islamic Establishments in Jihad arenas in a manner that conforms with our policies\"\nAl-Qaeda aims to establish an Islamic state in the Arab World, modelled after the Rashidun Caliphate, by initiating a global Jihad against the \"International Jewish-Crusader Alliance\" led by the United States, which it sees as the \"external enemy\" and against the secular governments in Muslim countries, that are described as \"the apostate domestic enemy\".[189] Once foreign influences and the secular ruling authorities are removed from Muslim countries through Jihad; al-Qaeda supports elections to choose the rulers of its proposed Islamic states. This is to be done through representatives of leadership councils (Shura) that would ensure the implementation of Shari'a (Islamic law). However, it opposes elections that institute parliaments which empower Muslim and non-Muslim legislators to collaborate in making laws of their own choosing.[190] In the second edition of his book Knights Under the Banner of the Prophet, Ayman Al Zawahiri writes:\nWe demand... the government of the rightly guiding caliphate, which is established on the basis of the sovereignty of sharia and not on the whims of the majority. Its ummah chooses its rulers....If they deviate, the ummah brings them to account and removes them. The ummah participates in producing that government's decisions and determining its direction. ... [The caliphal state] commands the right and forbids the wrong and engages in jihad to liberate Muslim lands and to free all humanity from all oppression and ignorance.[191]\nWhile the leadership's own theological platform is essentially Salafi, the organization's umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings. Al-Qaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with Wahhabism, Shafi'ism, Malikism, and Hanafism. There are even some Al-Qaeda members whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with Salafism, such as Yunis Khalis, one of the leaders of the Afghan mujahedin. He was a mystic who visited the tombs of saints and sought their blessings \u2013 practices inimical to bin Laden's Wahhabi-Salafi school of thought. The only exception to this pan-Islamic policy is Shi'ism. Al-Qaeda seems implacably opposed to it, as it holds Shi'ism to be heresy. In Iraq it has openly declared war on the Badr Brigades, who have fully cooperated with the US, and now considers even Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence.[193]\nOn the other hand, Professor Peter Mandaville states that Al-Qaeda follows a pragmatic policy in forming its local affiliates, with various cells being sub-contracted to Shia Muslim and non-Muslim members. The top-down chain of command means that each unit is answerable directly to central leadership, while they remain ignorant of their counterparts' presence or activities. These transnational networks of autonomous supply chains, financiers, underground militias and political supporters were set up during the 1990s, when Bin Laden's immediate aim was the expulsion of American troops from the Arabian Peninsula.[194]\nUnder the leadership of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda organization adopted the strategy of targeting non-combatant civilians of enemy states that indiscriminately attacked Muslims. Following the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, \"A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington\". According to a couple of critics, Quintan Wiktorowicz and John Kaltner, it provides \"ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation.\"[195]\nAmong these justifications are that America is leading the west in waging a War on Islam so that attacks on America are a defense of Islam and any treaties and agreements between Muslim majority states and Western countries that would be violated by attacks are null and void. According to the tract, several conditions allow for the killing of civilians including:\nretaliation for the American war on Islam which al-Qaeda alleges has targeted \"Muslim women, children and elderly\";\nwhen it is too difficult to distinguish between non-combatants and combatants when attacking an enemy \"stronghold\" (hist) and/or non-combatants remain in enemy territory, killing them is allowed;\nthose who assist the enemy \"in deed, word, mind\" are eligible for killing, and this includes the general population in democratic countries because civilians can vote in elections that bring enemies of Islam to power;\nthe necessity of killing in the war to protect Islam and Muslims;\nthe prophet Muhammad, when asked whether the Muslim fighters could use the catapult against the village of Taif, replied affirmatively, even though the enemy fighters were mixed with a civilian population;\nif the women, children and other protected groups serve as human shields for the enemy;\nif the enemy has broken a treaty, killing of civilians is permitted.[195]\nUnder the leadership of Sayf al-Adel, Al-Qaeda's strategy has underwent transformation and the organization has officially renounced the tactic of attacking civilian targets of enemies. In his book Free Reading of 33 Strategies of War published in 2023, Sayf al-Adel counselled Islamist fighters to prioritize attacking the police forces, military soldiers, state assets of enemy governments, etc. which he described as acceptable targets in military operations. Asserting that attacking women and children of enemies are contrary to Islamic values, Sayf al-Adel asked: \"If we target the general public, how can we expect their people to accept our call to Islam?\"[196]\nAl-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.[197]\nTo prevent the former Afghan king Mohammed Zahir Shah from coming back from exile and possibly becoming head of a new government, bin Laden instructed a Portuguese convert to Islam, Paulo Jose de Almeida Santos, to assassinate Zahir Shah. On November 4, 1991, Santos entered the king's villa in Rome posing as a journalist and tried to stab him with a dagger. A tin of cigarillos in the king's breast pocket deflected the blade and saved Zahir Shah's life. Santos was apprehended and jailed for 10 years in Italy.[198]\nOn December 29, 1992, Al-Qaeda launched the 1992 Yemen hotel bombings. Two bombs were detonated in Aden, Yemen. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.[199]\nThe bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, Operation Restore Hope. Internally, Al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the US, the attack was barely noticed. No American soldiers were killed because no soldiers were staying in the hotel at the time it was bombed, however, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker were killed in the bombing. Seven others, who were mostly Yemeni, were severely injured.[199] Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by Al-Qaeda's members, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by Ibn Taymiyyah, a 13th-century scholar admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.[200][unreliable source?]\nOn October 12, 2000, Al-Qaeda militants in Yemen bombed the missile destroyerUSS Cole in a suicide attack, killing 17 US servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, Al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the US itself.\nThe September 11 attacks on America by Al-Qaeda killed 2,996 people \u2013 2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel as well as 19 hijackers who committed murder-suicide. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the United States Capitol or the White House, crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers revolted. It was the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and to this day remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history.\nThe attacks were conducted by Al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the 1998 fatwa issued against the US and its allies by persons under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others.[26] Evidence points to suicide squads led by Al-Qaeda military commander Mohamed Atta as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Hambali as the key planners and part of the political and military command.\nMessages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001, praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement.[202] Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the US was actively oppressing Muslims.[203]\nBin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in \"Palestine, Chechnya, Kashmir and Iraq\" and Muslims should retain the \"right to attack in reprisal\". He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at people, but \"America's icons of military and economic power\", despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning when most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating the maximum number of human casualties.[204]\nEvidence later came to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the US East Coast. The targets were later altered by Al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack \"might get out of hand\".[205][206]\nIn the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government responded, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring Al-Qaeda. The US offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite Special Activities Division (SAD).\nThe Taliban offered to turn over bin Laden to a neutral country for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. US President George W. Bush responded by saying: \"We know he's guilty. Turn him over\",[246] and British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned the Taliban regime: \"Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power.\"[247]\nSoon thereafter the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the Afghan Northern Alliance removed the Taliban government as part of the war in Afghanistan. As a result of the US special forces and air support for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and Al-Qaeda training camps were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of Al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the Tora Bora area of Afghanistan, many Al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged Gardez region of the nation.\nBy early 2002, Al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared to be a success. Nevertheless, a significant Taliban insurgency remained in Afghanistan.\nDebate continued regarding the nature of Al-Qaeda's role in the 9/11 attacks. The US State Department released a videotape showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.[248] Although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people,[249] the tape definitively implicates bin Laden and Al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks. The tape was aired on many television channels, with an accompanying English translation provided by the US Defense Department.[250]\nIn September 2004, the 9/11 Commission officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives.[251] In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: \"As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.\"[252]\nAl-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, while supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.\nIslamist rebels in the Sahara calling themselves Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years.[258][259][260] French officials say the rebels have no real links to the Al-Qaeda leadership, but this has been disputed. It seems likely that bin Laden approved the group's name in late 2006, and the rebels \"took on the al Qaeda franchise label\", almost a year before the violence began to escalate.[261]\nIn Mali, the Ansar Dine faction was also reported as an ally of Al-Qaeda in 2013.[262] The Ansar al Dine faction aligned themselves with the AQIM.[263]\nBefore the 9/11 attacks and the US invasion of Afghanistan, westerners who had been recruits at Al-Qaeda training camps were sought after by Al-Qaeda's military wing. Language skills and knowledge of Western culture were generally found among recruits from Europe, such was the case with Mohamed Atta, an Egyptian national studying in Germany at the time of his training, and other members of the Hamburg Cell. Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atef would later designate Atta as the ringleader of the 9/11 hijackers. Following the attacks, Western intelligence agencies determined that Al-Qaeda cells operating in Europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in Afghanistan.[154][270]\nIn 2003, Islamists carried out a series of bombings in Istanbul killing fifty-seven people and injuring seven hundred. Seventy-four people were charged by the Turkish authorities. Some had previously met bin Laden, and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to Al-Qaeda they asked for its blessing and help.[271][272]\nFollowing Yemeni unification in 1990, Wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country. Although it is unlikely bin Laden or Saudi Al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the USS Cole bombing.[279] Concerns grew over al-Qaeda's group in Yemen.[280]\nIn Iraq, al-Qaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad group commanded by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Specializing in suicide operations, they have been a \"key driver\" of the Sunni insurgency.[281] Although they played a small part in the overall insurgency, between 30% and 42% of all suicide bombings which took place in the early years were claimed by Zarqawi's group.[282][283] Reports have indicated that oversights such as the failure to control access to the Qa'qaa munitions factory in Yusufiyah have allowed large quantities of munitions to fall into the hands of al-Qaida.[284] In November 2010, the militant group Islamic State of Iraq, which is linked to al-Qaeda in Iraq, threatened to \"exterminate all Iraqi Christians\".[285][286]\nAl-Qaeda did not begin training Palestinians until the late 1990s.[287] Large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have rejected an alliance with al-Qaeda, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their cells. This may have changed recently. The Israeli security and intelligence services believe al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for an opportunity to attack.[287]\nUS officials believe al-Qaeda was helping organize attacks in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.[302] Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan.[303] In 2006 al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir.[294][304] However Indian Army General H. S. Panag argued that the army had ruled out the presence of al-Qaeda in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. Panag also said al-Qaeda had strong ties with Kashmiri militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed based in Pakistan.[305] It has been noted that Waziristan has become a battlefield for Kashmiri militants fighting NATO in support of al-Qaeda and Taliban.[306][307][308]Dhiren Barot, who wrote the Army of Madinah in Kashmir[309] and was an al-Qaeda operative convicted for involvement in the 2004 financial buildings plot, had received training in weapons and explosives at a militant training camp in Kashmir.[310]\nLashkar-e-Taiba, a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 Mumbai attacks, is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan.[316] In late 2002, top Al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safe house in Faisalabad.[317] The FBI believes al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been 'intertwined' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba.[317]Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re told Reuters in 2009 that \"Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda. Lashkar-e-Taiba is a member of al-Qaeda.\"[318][319]\nIn a video released in 2008, American-born senior al-Qaeda operative Adam Yahiye Gadahn said that \"victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which, Allah willing, will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land.\"[320]\nIn January 2010, US Defense secretary Robert Gates, while on a visit to Pakistan, said that al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.[328]\nAl-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance. The group's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, with online activities that include financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, and information dissemination, gathering and sharing.[329]\nThe range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores. A website associated with Al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur Nick Berg being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of Paul Johnson, Kim Sun-il, and Daniel Pearl, were first posted on jihadist websites.[citation needed]\nIn December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to al Jazeera as he had done in the past. Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain they would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editing out anything critical of the Saudi royal family.[330]\nAlneda.com and Jehad.net were perhaps the most significant al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was initially taken down by American Jon Messner, but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content.[citation needed]\nThe US government charged a British information technology specialist, Babar Ahmad, with terrorist offences related to his operating a network of English-language al-Qaeda websites, such as Azzam.com. He was convicted and sentenced to 12+1\u20442 years in prison.[331][332][333]\nal-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including \"several Boeing 727 aircraft\", turboprops and executive jets, according to a 2010 Reuters story. Based on a US Department of Homeland Security report, the story said al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa. A Boeing 727 can carry up to ten tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly kidnapping Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities.[335]\nExperts debate the notion that the al-Qaeda attacks were an indirect consequence of the American CIA's Operation Cyclone program to help the Afghan mujahideen. Robin Cook, British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and bin Laden were \"a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies\", and that \"Al-Qaida, literally 'the database', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians.\"[339]\nThe strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.[340]\nCNN journalist Peter Bergen, Pakistani ISI Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as Vincent Cannistraro,[341] deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin Laden, or that they armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them. In his 2004 book Ghost Wars, Steve Coll writes that the CIA had contemplated providing direct support to the foreign mujahideen, but that the idea never moved beyond discussions.[342]\nBergen and others[who else?] argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight.[342][failed verification] Bergen further argues that foreign mujahideen had no need for American funds since they received several million dollars per year from internal sources. Lastly, he argues that Americans could not have trained the foreign mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan, and the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.\nAccording to Bergen, who conducted the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997: the idea that \"the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden... [is] a folk myth. There's no evidence of this... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.\"[343]\nJason Burke also wrote:\nSome of the $500 million the CIA poured into Afghanistan reached [Al-Zawahiri's] group. Al-Zawahiri has become a close aide of bin Laden... Bin Laden was only loosely connected with the [Hezb-i-Islami faction of the mujahideen led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar], serving under another Hezb-i-Islami commander known as Engineer Machmud. However, bin Laden's Office of Services, set up to recruit overseas for the war, received some US cash.[344]\nAnders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, was inspired by al-Qaeda, calling it \"the most successful revolutionary movement in the world.\" While admitting different aims, he sought to \"create a European version of Al-Qaida.\"[345][346]\nThe appropriate response to offshoots is a subject of debate. A journalist reported in 2012 that a senior US military planner had asked: \"Should we resort to drones and Special Operations raids every time some group raises the black banner of al Qaeda? How long can we continue to chase offshoots of offshoots around the world?\"[347]\nAccording to CNN journalists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank, a number of \"religious scholars, former fighters and militants\" who previously supported Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) had turned against the Al-Qaeda-supported Iraqi insurgency in 2008; due to ISI's indiscriminate attacks against civilians while targeting US-led coalition forces. American military analyst Bruce Riedel wrote in 2008 that \"a wave of revulsion\" arose against ISI, which enabled US-allied Sons of Iraq faction to turn various tribal leaders in the Anbar region against the Iraqi insurgency. In response, Bin Laden and Zawahiri issued public statements urging Muslims to rally behind ISI leadership and support the armed struggle against American forces.[348]\nIn response to Noman Benotman, a former militant member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007, after persuading the imprisoned senior leaders of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with Al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months after \"they were said to have renounced violence.\"[349]\nIn 2007, on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks,[350] the Saudi sheikh Salman al-Ouda delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. Al-Ouda addressed Al-Qaeda's leader on television asking him:\nMy brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?[351]\nAccording to Pew polls, support for Al-Qaeda had dropped in the Muslim world in the years before 2008.[352] In Saudi Arabia, only ten percent had a favorable view of Al-Qaeda, according to a December 2007 poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based think tank.[353]\nIn 2007, the imprisoned Dr. Fadl, who was an influential Afghan Arab and former associate of Ayman al-Zawahiri, withdrew his support from al-Qaeda and criticized the organization in his book Wathiqat Tarshid Al-'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w'Al-'Alam (English: Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World). In response, Al-Zawahiri accused Dr. Fadl of promoting \"an Islam without jihad\" that aligns with Western interests and wrote a nearly two hundred pages long treatise, titled \"The Exoneration\" which appeared on the Internet in March 2008. In his treatise, Zawahiri justified military strikes against US targets as retaliatory attacks to defend Muslim community against American aggression.[350]\nIn an online town hall forum conducted in December 2007, Zawahiri denied that al-Qaeda deliberately targeted innocents and accused the American coalition of killing innocent people.[354] Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 LIFG completed a new \"code\" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled \"Corrective Studies\". Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against Al-Qaeda, the LIFG's reversal may be an important step toward staunching Al-Qaeda's recruitment.[355]\nBilal Abdul Kareem, an American journalist based in Syria created a documentary about al-Shabab, Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia. The documentary included interviews with former members of the group who stated their reasons for leaving al-Shabab. The members made accusations of segregation, lack of religious awareness and internal corruption and favoritism. In response to Kareem, the Global Islamic Media Front condemned Kareem, called him a liar, and denied the accusations from the former fighters.[356]\nIn mid-2014 after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant declared that they had restored the Caliphate, an audio statement was released by the then-spokesman of the group Abu Muhammad al-Adnani claiming that \"the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the Caliphate's authority.\" The speech included a religious refutation of Al-Qaeda for being too lenient regarding Shiites and their refusal to recognize the authority Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, al-Adnani specifically noting: \"It is not suitable for a state to give allegiance to an organization.\" He also recalled a past instance in which Osama bin Laden called on Al-Qaeda members and supporters to give allegiance to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi when the group was still solely operating in Iraq, as the Islamic State of Iraq, and condemned Ayman al-Zawahiri for not making this same claim for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Zawahiri was encouraging factionalism and division between former allies of ISIL such as the al-Nusra Front.[357][358]\n^A. Geltzer, Joshua (2010). \"4: The al-Qaeda world view\".

Two months before 9/11, Zawahiri, who had become al Qaeda's second-in-command, published Knigbts Under the Banner of the Prophet, which offers insight into why al Qacda decided to attack the United States within its borders. In it, he stated that al Qaeda aimed to establish an Islamic state in the Arab world: Just as victory is not achieved for an army unless its foot soldiers occupy land, the mujahid lslamic movement will not achieve victory against the global infdel alliance unless it possesses a base in the heart of the Islamic world. Every plan and method we consider to rally and mobilize the ummab will be hanging in the air with no concrete result or tangible return unless it leads to the establishment of the caliphal state in the heart of the Islamic world. Achieving this goal, Zawahiri explained elsewhere in the book, would require a global jihad: It is not possible to incite a conflict for the establishment of a Muslim state if it is a regional conflict.... The international Jewish-Crusader alliance, led by America, will not allow any Muslim force to obtain power in any of the Muslim lands. ... It will impose sanctions on whoever helps it, even if it does not declare war against them altogether. Therefore, to adjust to this new reality, we must prepare ourselves for a battle that is not confined to a single region but rather includes the apostate domestic enemy and the Jewish-Crusader external enemy. To confront this insidious alliance, Zawahiri argued, al Qaeda had to first root out U.S. infuence in the region...\n^McCants, William (September 2011). \"Al Qaeda's Challenge: The Jihadists' War With Islamist Democrats\". Foreign Affairs. 90 (5): 20\u201332. JSTOR23041773 \u2013 via JSTOR. Zawahiri does not oppose all elections; for example, he supports elections for the rulers of Islamic states and for representatives on leadership councils, which would ensure that these governments implemented Islamic law properly. But he opposes any system in which elections empower legislators to make laws of their own choosing... Bin Laden agreed with Zawahiri's take on elections, stating in January 2009 that once foreign influence and local tyrants have been removed from Islamic countries, true Muslims can elect their own presidents. And like Zawahiri, bin Laden argued that elections should not create parliaments that allow Muslims and non-Muslims to collaborate on making laws.\n^Gunaratna 2002, p. 147: \"The Al Qaeda team included Abu Talha al-Sudani, Saif al-Islam el-Masry, Salem el-Masry, Saif al-Adel and other trainers, including Abu Jaffer el-Masry, the explosives expert who ran the Jihad Wal camp Afghanistan.

Others took flight during the civil war that erupted following the Soviet retreat that led to the Taliban\u2019s initial rise.\nA new generation went to Pakistan in the aftermath of September 11 attacks, ebbing and flowing during the near two decades of conflict that followed. The Taliban\u2019s return to power in 2021 following the United States\u2019 chaotic withdrawal sparked another wave of some 600,000 refugees.\nNow Afghans from all those different generations are being told to go back.\nAfghan refugees arrive in trucks and cars to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Chaman on October 31, 2023\nAbdul Basit/AFP/Getty Images\nPakistan\u2019s caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti has previously said security concerns were behind the deportation order, claiming that Afghan nationals had carried out 14 of the 24 major terrorist attacks that have taken place in Pakistan this year.\nBut the order has been criticized by international rights groups both for its massive scope and for the way it is being carried out, with many Afghans alleging mistreatment by Pakistani authorities.\nPakistan is home to more than two million undocumented Afghans. Their presence has long been controversial, and this is not the first time they have faced police crackdowns and threats of deportation.

        "context": "\nThe seven non-eurozone members of the EU are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden. They continue to use their own national currencies, although all but Denmark are obliged to join once they meet the euro convergence criteria.[9] Among non-EU member states, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City have formal agreements with the EU to use the euro as their official currency and issue their own coins.[10][11][12]\nIn addition, Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro unilaterally.[13] These six countries, however, have no representation in any eurozone institution.[14]\nSince the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the eurozone has established and used provisions for granting emergency loans to member states in return for enacting economic reforms.[citation needed] The eurozone has also enacted some limited fiscal integration; for example, in peer review of each other's national budgets. The issue is political and in a state of flux in terms of what further provisions will be agreed for eurozone change. No eurozone member state has left, and there are no provisions to do so or to be expelled.[15]\nIn 1998, eleven member states of the European Union had met the euro convergence criteria, and the eurozone came into existence with the official launch of the euro (alongside national currencies) on 1 January 1999 in those countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece qualified in 2000 and was admitted on 1 January 2001.\nThese twelve founding members introduced physical euro banknotes and euro coins on 1 January 2002. After a short transition period, they took out of circulation and rendered invalid their pre-euro national coins and notes.\nBetween 2007 and 2023, eight new states have acceded: Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\nThe euro is also used in countries outside the EU. Four states (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) have signed formal agreements with the EU to use the euro and issue their own coins.[28][29] Nevertheless, they are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB and do not have a seat in the ECB or Euro Group.\nAkrotiri and Dhekelia (located on the island of Cyprus) belong to the United Kingdom, but there are agreements between the UK and Cyprus[citation needed] and between UK and EU[citation needed] about their partial integration with Cyprus and partial adoption of Cypriot law, including the usage of euro in Akrotiri and Dhekelia.[citation needed]\nKosovo and Montenegro officially adopted the euro as their sole currency without an agreement and, therefore, have no issuing rights.[29] These states are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB. However, sometimes the term eurozone is applied to all territories that have adopted the euro as their sole currency.[30][31][32] Further unilateral adoption of the euro (euroisation), by both non-euro EU and non-EU members, is opposed by the ECB and EU.[33]\nThe chart below provides a full summary of all applying exchange-rate regimes for EU members, since the birth, on 13 March 1979, of the European Monetary System with its Exchange Rate Mechanism and the related new common currency ECU. On 1 January 1999, the euro replaced the ECU 1:1 at the exchange rate markets. During 1979\u20131999, the D-Mark functioned as a de facto anchor for the ECU, meaning there was only a minor difference between pegging a currency against the ECU and pegging it against the D-Mark.\nThe eurozone was born with its first 11 member states on 1 January 1999. The first enlargement of the eurozone, to Greece, took place on 1 January 2001, one year before the euro physically entered into circulation. The next enlargements were to states which joined the EU in 2004, and then joined the eurozone on 1 January of the year noted: Slovenia in 2007, Cyprus in 2008, Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015. Croatia, which acceded to the EU in 2013, adopted the euro in 2023.\nAll new EU members joining the bloc after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 are obliged to adopt the euro under the terms of their accession treaties. However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria which need first to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion, which requires having been an ERM-member for a minimum of two years without the presence of \"severe tensions\" for the currency exchange rate.\nIn September 2011, a diplomatic source close to the euro adoption preparation talks with the seven remaining new member states who had yet to adopt the euro at that time (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania), claimed that the monetary union (eurozone) they had thought they were going to join upon their signing of the accession treaty may very well end up being a very different union, entailing a much closer fiscal, economic, and political convergence than originally anticipated. This changed legal status of the eurozone could potentially cause them to conclude that the conditions for their promise to join were no longer valid, which \"could force them to stage new referendums\" on euro adoption.[34]\nBefore joining the eurozone, a state must spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II). As of January 2023[update], the Danish central bank and the Bulgarian central bank participate in ERM II.\nDenmark obtained a special opt-out in the original Maastricht Treaty, and thus is legally exempt from joining the eurozone unless its government decides otherwise, either by parliamentary vote or referendum. The United Kingdom likewise had an opt-out prior to withdrawing from the EU in 2020.\nThe remaining six countries are obliged to adopt the euro in future, although the EU has so far not tried to enforce any time plan. They should join as soon as they fulfill the convergence criteria, which include being part of ERM II for two years. Sweden, which joined the EU in 1995 after the Maastricht Treaty was signed, is required to join the eurozone. However, the Swedish people turned down euro adoption in a 2003 referendum and since then the country has intentionally avoided fulfilling the adoption requirements by not joining ERM II, which is voluntary.[35][36] Bulgaria joined ERM II on 10 July 2020.[37]\nInterest in joining the eurozone increased in Denmark, and initially in Poland, as a result of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. In Iceland, there was an increase in interest in joining the European Union, a pre-condition for adopting the euro.[38] However, by 2010 the debt crisis in the eurozone caused interest from Poland, as well as the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden to cool.[39]\nIn the opinion of journalist Leigh Phillips and Locke Lord's Charles Proctor,[40][41] there is no provision in any European Union treaty for an exit from the eurozone. In fact, they argued, the Treaties make it clear that the process of monetary union was intended to be \"irreversible\" and \"irrevocable\".[41] However, in 2009, a European Central Bank legal study argued that, while voluntary withdrawal is legally not possible, expulsion remains \"conceivable\".[42] Although an explicit provision for an exit option does not exist, many experts and politicians in Europe have suggested an option to leave the eurozone should be included in the relevant treaties.[43]\nOn the issue of leaving the eurozone, the European Commission has stated that \"[t]he irrevocability of membership in the euro area is an integral part of the Treaty framework and the Commission, as a guardian of the EU Treaties, intends to fully respect [that irrevocability].\"[44] It added that it \"does not intend to propose [any] amendment\" to the relevant Treaties, the current status being \"the best way going forward to increase the resilience of euro area Member States to potential economic and financial crises.[44] The European Central Bank, responding to a question by a Member of the European Parliament, has stated that an exit is not allowed under the Treaties.[45]\nLikewise there is no provision for a state to be expelled from the euro.[46] Some, however, including the Dutch government, favour the creation of an expulsion provision for the case whereby a heavily indebted state in the eurozone refuses to comply with an EU economic reform policy.[47]\nIn a Texas law journal, University of Texas at Austin law professor Jens Dammann has argued that even now EU law contains an implicit right for member states to leave the eurozone if they no longer meet the criteria that they had to meet in order to join it.[48] Furthermore, he has suggested that, under narrow circumstances, the European Union can expel member states from the eurozone.[49]\nThe monetary policy of all countries in the eurozone is managed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem which comprises the ECB and the central banks of the EU states who have joined the eurozone. Countries outside the eurozone are not represented in these institutions. Whereas all EU member states are part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), non EU member states have no say in all three institutions, even those with monetary agreements such as Monaco. The ECB is entitled to authorise the design and printing of euro banknotes and the volume of euro coins minted, and its president is currently Christine Lagarde.\nThe eurozone is represented politically by its finance ministers, known collectively as the Eurogroup, and is presided over by a president, currently Paschal Donohoe. The finance ministers of the EU member states that use the euro meet a day before a meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) of the Council of the European Union. The Group is not an official Council formation but when the full EcoFin council votes on matters only affecting the eurozone, only Euro Group members are permitted to vote on it.[50][51][52]\nSince the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the Euro Group has met irregularly not as finance ministers, but as heads of state and government (like the European Council). It is in this forum, the Euro summit, that many eurozone reforms have been decided upon. In 2011, former French PresidentNicolas Sarkozy pushed for these summits to become regular and twice a year in order for it to be a 'true economic government'.[citation needed]\nIn April 2008 in Brussels, future European CommissionPresidentJean-Claude Juncker suggested that the eurozone should be represented at the IMF as a bloc, rather than each member state separately: \"It is absurd for those 15 countries not to agree to have a single representation at the IMF. It makes us look absolutely ridiculous. We are regarded as buffoons on the international scene\".[53] In 2017 Juncker stated that he aims to have this agreed by the end of his mandate in 2019.[54] However, Finance CommissionerJoaqu\u00edn Almunia stated that before there is common representation, a common political agenda should be agreed upon.[53]\nLeading EU figures including the commission and national governments have proposed a variety of reforms to the eurozone's architecture; notably the creation of a Finance Minister, a larger eurozone budget, and reform of the current bailout mechanisms into either a \"European Monetary Fund\" or a eurozone Treasury. While many have similar themes, details vary greatly.[55][56][57][58]\nThe 20 largest economies in the world including eurozone as a single entity, by nominal GDP (2020) at their peak level of GDP in billions US$. The values for EU members that are not also eurozone members are listed both separately and as part of the EU.[60]\nInterest rates for the eurozone, set by the ECB since 1999.[62] Levels are in percentages per annum. Between June 2000 and October 2008, the main refinancing operations were variable rate tenders, as opposed to fixed rate tenders. The figures indicated in the table from 2000 to 2008 refer to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.[4]\nComparison of government surplus/deficit (2001\u20132012) of eurozone, United States and United Kingdom\nThe primary means for fiscal coordination within the EU lies in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which are written for every member state, but with particular reference to the 20 current members of the eurozone. These guidelines are not binding, but are intended to represent policy coordination among the EU member states, so as to take into account the linked structures of their economies.\nFor their mutual assurance and stability of the currency, members of the eurozone have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, which sets agreed limits on deficits and national debt, with associated sanctions for deviation. The Pact originally set a limit of 3% of GDP for the yearly deficit of all eurozone member states; with fines for any state which exceeded this amount. In 2005, Portugal, Germany, and France had all exceeded this amount, but the Council of Ministers had not voted to fine those states. Subsequently, reforms were adopted to provide more flexibility and ensure that the deficit criteria took into account the economic conditions of the member states, and additional factors.\nOlivier Blanchard suggests that a fiscal union in the eurozone can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the eurozone peripheral countries. But he adds that the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the eurozone peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, they are forced to adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.[71]\nThe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 prompted a number of reforms in the eurozone. One was a U-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy that led to the creation of a specific fund to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However, the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the EU treaties. Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a permanent treaty basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article 136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.\nIn February 2016, the UK secured further confirmation that countries that do not use the Euro would not be required to contribute to bailouts for eurozone countries.[72]\nIn June 2010, a broad agreement was finally reached on a controversial proposal for member states to peer review each other's budgets prior to their presentation to national parliaments. Although showing the entire budget to each other was opposed by Germany, Sweden and the UK, each government would present to their peers and the Commission their estimates for growth, inflation, revenue and expenditure levels six months before they go to national parliaments. If a country was to run a deficit, they would have to justify it to the rest of the EU while countries with a debt more than 60% of GDP would face greater scrutiny.[73]\nThe plans would apply to all EU members, not just the eurozone, and have to be approved by EU leaders along with proposals for states to face sanctions before they reach the 3% limit in the Stability and Growth Pact. Poland has criticised the idea of withholding regional funding for those who break the deficit limits, as that would only impact the poorer states.[73] In June 2010 France agreed to back Germany's plan for suspending the voting rights of members who breach the rules.[74] In March 2011 was initiated a new reform of the Stability and Growth Pact aiming at straightening the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the deficit or the debt rules.[75][76]\nIn 1997, Arnulf Baring expressed concern that the European Monetary Union would make Germans the most hated people in Europe. Baring suspected the possibility that the people in Mediterranean countries would regard Germans and the currency bloc as economic policemen.[77]\nIn 2001, James Tobin thought that the euro project would not succeed without making drastic changes to European institutions, pointing out the difference between the US and the eurozone.[78] Concerning monetary policies, the system of Federal Reserve banks in the US aims at both growth and reducing unemployment, while the ECB tends to give its first priority to price stability under the Bundesbank's supervision. As the price level of the currency bloc is kept low, the unemployment level of the region has become higher than that of the US since 1982.[78] Concerning fiscal policies, 12% of the US federal budget is used for transfers to states and local governments. The US government does not impose restrictions on state budget policies, whereas the Treaty of Maastricht requires each eurozone member country to keep its budget deficit below 3% of its GDP.[78]\nThe eurozone has also been criticized for deepening inequality in Europe, particularly between the richest and poorest countries.[83] According to a study by Bertelsmann Stiftung, countries such as Austria and the Netherlands benefited significantly from the common currency, while southern and eastern European members of the eurozone gained very little,[84] and some countries are considered to have suffered adverse effects from adopting the euro.[85] In an article for the Politico, Joseph Stiglitz argues: \"The result for the eurozone has been slower growth, and especially for the weaker countries within it. The euro was supposed to usher in greater prosperity, which in turn would lead to renewed commitment to European integration. It has done just the opposite \u2014 increasing divisions within the EU, especially between creditor and debtor countries.\"[85] Matthias Matthijs believes that the euro resulted in a \"winner-take-all\" economy, as national income differences between eurozone members have widened further.[86] He argues that countries such as Austria and Germany have gained from the eurozone at the expense of southern countries like Italy and Spain.[86]\nBy adopting the euro and abandoning their national currencies, eurozone countries gave up their ability to conduct independent monetary policy; as such, monetary policies used to combat recession, such as monetary stimulus or currency devaluation, are no longer available.[86] During the European debt crisis, several eurozone countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus) were unable to repay their debt without third-party intervention by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.[87] In order to grant the bailout, the ECB and the IMF forced the affected countries to adopt strict austerity measures.[86] The European bailouts were largely about shifting exposure from banks onto European taxpayers,[88][89][90] and exacerbated issues such as high unemployment and poverty.[91][92]\nIn 2019, a study from the Centre for European Policy concluded that while some countries had gained from adopting the euro, several countries were poorer than they would have been had they not adopted it, with France and Italy being particularly affected.[93][94] The publication prompted a large number of reactions, pushing its authors to put out a statement clarifying some points.[95] In 2020, a study from the University of Bonn reached a different conclusion: the adoption of the euro made \u201csome mild losers (France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal) and a clear winner (Ireland)\u201d.[96] Both studies used the synthetic control method to estimate what might have happened if the euro hadn't been adopted.\n^Includes the population of Croatia, even though it was not a eurozone member in 2021.\n^The ECB announced on 22 December 1998 that, between 4 and 21 January 1999, there would be a narrow corridor of 50 basis points interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility in order to help the transition to the ECB's interest regime.",

Smith lived in Cherry Tree Drive, Parr, St Helens throughout his childhood and attended St Cuthbert's High School nearby. When he was 15, he fell off his bike on the way to school breaking his hip, which required him to use crutches for 16 weeks. During that period, Smith threw his first 180 while on crutches. After leaving school, he took a joinery course at college, but he decided to drop out with one exam remaining to play in a darts tournament instead, a decision that he has described as the best of his life.[2] He was a regular winner of local darts events and made his debut in a PDC major at the 2009 UK Open where he lost 6\u20135 to Dave Ladley in the first round.[3]\nSmith's position on the ProTour Order of Merit also saw him qualify for the 2013 World Championship,[17] as he took the second of sixteen places that were awarded to the highest non-qualified players.[18] However, he ran into an in-form Raymond van Barneveld in the first round who averaged 108.31 as Smith could only win one leg during the match in a 0\u20133 defeat.[19]\nSmith reached the final of the third UK Open Qualifier in March, but was beaten 2\u20136 by Michael van Gerwen.[20]\nSmith won the 2013 PDC World Youth Championship with a 6\u20131 victory over Ricky Evans, which was broadcast just before the 2013 Premier League Darts Final. Smith led van Barneveld 3\u20130 in the third round of the UK Open but went on to lose 8\u20139.[21] In October, he advanced to the semi-finals for the second time in 2013 at the 12th Players Championship but his run was ended with a 6\u20133 defeat to Kevin Painter.[22] His youth title earned him a place in the Grand Slam of Darts and he produced an impressive display in his first group match against Dave Chisnall as from 3\u20131 down he hit legs of 11, 12, 14, and 13 darts to win 5\u20133 with an average of 103.17.[23] However, he then lost 5\u20132 to Scott Waites and 5\u20131 to Ted Hankey to finish third in Group H and be eliminated from the tournament.[24]\nSmith broke into the world's top 32 on the Order of Merit just before the cut-off for the 2014 World Championship to qualify through the main ranking list for the first time.[25] He beat Morihiro Hashimoto 3\u20131 in the first round.[26]\nHe then defeated reigning and 16-time world champion Phil Taylor 4\u20133 in the second round, taking out the bullseye on a 128 finish to win the match.[27] In the next round, Smith hit a 136 finish, with his opponent Peter Wright waiting on 41, to lead 3\u20132 but only won one more leg after this to lose 4\u20133.[28] He was named the PDC's Young Player of the Year at the Annual Awards in January.[29] Smith won through to the final of the sixth UK Open Qualifier of the year but averaged just 70.94 as he was whitewashed 6\u20130 by Michael van Gerwen.[30] A rematch against Wright followed in the third round of the UK Open with Smith throwing for the match in the final leg, but he missed a total of seven darts at doubles to lose 9\u20138.[31] His second final of 2014 was at the fifth Players Championship, which he reached by beating Raymond van Barneveld 6\u20133 in the quarter-finals and Gary Anderson 6\u20134 in the semis, but he was again whitewashed in the decider, this time by Brendan Dolan.[32]\nAfter seeing off Mensur Suljovi\u0107 3\u20131 in the first round of the 2015 World Championship, Smith beat Brendan Dolan 4\u20132 after having been 2\u20130 down, to set up a third round tie with fellow St. Helens player Stephen Bunting.[40] Despite taking out checkouts of 170 and 132, Smith was 3\u20130 down, before finding his scoring game to restrict Bunting to one leg as he closed the gap to 3\u20132. Ultimately his slow start to the match proved costly as he lost the next set to be knocked out 4\u20132 in a game that saw each player average 102 and hit eight 180s apiece.[41] Smith won the fifth UK Open Qualifier by beating Adrian Lewis 6\u20135.[42] A rematch with Bunting followed in the third round of the UK Open, with Smith missing two match darts in the deciding leg to be beaten 9\u20138.[43] He claimed the second European Tour title of his career by winning the International Darts Open with a 6\u20133 victory over Benito van de Pas in the final.[44] Smith suffered a 10\u20134 defeat to Gerwyn Price in the first round of the World Matchplay, but retained his European Darts Trophy title by seeing off Michael van Gerwen in the final for the second year in a row.[45] At the World Grand Prix, he punished two missed match darts from Price to beat him 2\u20131, but Smith then lost from 2\u20130 up in sets against Jamie Lewis in the second round.[46] Wins over Wayne Jones, Lewis and Andy Fordham saw Smith top his group at the Grand Slam and he then averaged 104.59 to beat Dave Chisnall 10\u20137 and reach the quarter-finals. Smith's first major event semi-final soon followed as he defeated Lewis 16\u201311, but he was heavily beaten 16\u20136 by Van Gerwen.[47][48]\nAt the 2016 World Championship wins over Jeffrey de Zwaan, Steve Beaton, and Benito van de Pas saw Smith reach the quarter-finals for the first time, where he was 3\u20130 ahead of Raymond van Barneveld.[49] He could only win two legs as Van Barneveld moved 4\u20133 up, but he took the next to take the match to a ninth and final set. Smith finished 130 on double five to move within a leg of the match and missed one dart to win it, before Van Barneveld won four legs in a row to end Smith's event.[50] Smith made his debut in the Premier League after receiving a wildcard from the PDC.[51] On the opening night, he played twice due to Gary Anderson being ill. Smith lost his first matches 7\u20132 to Peter Wright and 7\u20131 to Adrian Lewis. His first point came in week three courtesy of a 6\u20136 draw with Dave Chisnall. Michael van Gerwen scored a world record three-dart average of 123.40 against Smith in a 7\u20131 win, but the following week, Smith got his first Premier League victory by beating Van Barneveld 7\u20135.[52] However, Smith lost his last two matches to finish bottom of the table and be eliminated from the event.[53]\nSmith entered the 2017 World Championship without a match win since September 2016 having lost 10 in a row. He took the deciding set of his first round match with Ricky Evans without dropping a leg and said he had been \"fighting his demons\" recently.[57] In the next round, he missed five darts to eliminate Mervyn King 4\u20131, but kept his composure to eventually see him off 4\u20133.[58] Smith went 3\u20131 up on James Wade in the third round, but after Wade took the next set, Smith lost six legs in a row to be eliminated 4\u20133.[59] He missed two darts to win the third UK Open Qualifier as Peter Wright beat him 6\u20135.[60] Four 6\u20135 wins saw him reach the final of the Gibraltar Darts Trophy and at 4\u20134 he took out a 132 finish with Mensur Suljovi\u0107 waiting on 56 to break throw and took home his first title in nearly two years with a 6\u20134 victory.[61] Smith qualified for the 2017 European Championship as third seed, losing in the quarter-final to Rob Cross.[62]\nSmith began his 2022 World Championship campaign with a comfortable 3\u20130 win over Ron Meulenkamp, before defeating William O'Connor 4\u20132. The next two games saw him take on two of the most in-form players from the 2021 season; first defeating Jonny Clayton in a last-set shootout that went to extra legs; and then triumphing over defending champion Gerwyn Price, surviving two match darts before winning the final set. In the semi-final Smith took an early lead over James Wade and eventually triumphed 6\u20133, reaching the final for the second time in his career.[77] Smith lost the final 7\u20135 to Peter Wright and claimed \u00a3200,000 as runner-up.\nSmith reached the final of the UK Open in March, but lost 11\u201310 to Danny Noppert despite Noppert only averaging 84.82 to see his 7th final defeat. He recovered well to win a night event on the final standard night of the 2022 Premier League, but came 7th in the table and did not qualify for the playoff places. His good form after the UK Open continued, winning 3 Pro Tour titles in a short period and performing well in the European Tour.\nSmith opened his 2023 World Championship campaign with a 3\u20130 win over Nathan Rafferty. In the third round Smith came from 3\u20131 down to beat Martin Schindler 4\u20133, before beating Joe Cullen and Stephen Bunting to reach the semi-finals. In the semi-final Smith beat Gabriel Clemens 6\u20132 to reach his third World Championship final.\nIn the final, Smith hit a nine dart finish only seconds after Michael van Gerwen missed Double 12 for his own nine darter.[80]\nAfter a back and forth match, Smith broke van Gerwen's throw and held his own throw to lead 6\u20133. After losing the tenth set and going two down in the eleventh set, Smith won two legs in a row to throw for the match. Smith finished in eleven darts to win 7\u20134 and become world champion for the first time and move up to world number one in the PDC Order of Merit for the first time. He also became the first player to win both the PDC World Youth Championship and the PDC World Darts Championship.[81]",

The IRS requires a minimum withholding of 24% of the prize (minus the wager) of any gambling win in excess of $5,000. However, the net for a major prize often is misleading; winners often owe the IRS upon filing a return because the Federal withholding was below the winner's tax obligations. Nonresident U.S. lottery winners have 30% of winnings of at least $600 withheld.

        "context": "\nThe Astros were established as the Houston Colt .45s and entered the National League as an expansion team in 1962 along with the New York Mets. The current name, reflecting Houston's role as the host of the Johnson Space Center, was adopted three years later, when they moved into the Astrodome, the first domed sports stadium and the so-called \"Eighth Wonder of the World\". The Astros moved to a new stadium called Minute Maid Park in 2000.[8] The Astros played in the NL West division from 1969 to 1993, then the NL Central division from 1994 to 2012, before being moved to the AL West as part of an MLB realignment in 2013.\nThe Astros posted their first winning record in 1972 and made the playoffs for the first time in 1980, and they won three division titles in the 1980s. Spearheaded by the Killer B's, a collection of prominent hitters that included the Astros' only Hall of Fame members Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, the Astros began reaching major prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s with four further division titles and two Wild Card appearances, culminating in their first World Series appearance in 2005 where they were swept by the AL's Chicago White Sox.\nAfter a major slump throughout the next decade, the team was purchased by business owner Jim Crane in 2011 for $680 million. Under Crane's ownership, the Astros embraced sabermetrics and pioneered new analytical technologies in their transition to the American League, and by the mid-2010s has transformed from a poor franchise into one of MLB's most dominant and successful clubs. Since then, the Astros have won over 100 games in four seasons, appeared in a record six consecutive American League Championship Series, and won four of the last six American League pennants. During this time, the Astros won the 2017 World Series, their first championship, against the Los Angeles Dodgers; however, this win proved controversial after the Astros were caught in a sign stealing scandal. They made later World Series appearances in 2019 against the Washington Nationals, 2021 against the Atlanta Braves, and 2022 against the Philadelphia Phillies, winning their second title in the latter series. This success has led some commentators to declare the Astros, since 2015, as the leading team in the American League.[9][10][11] They are the only team to win a postseason series in seven straight seasons. Their fifth pennant in 2022 made them the second team created in the expansion era to win five league pennants (after the Mets) and the fifth expansion team to have won two World Series championships.\nFrom 1962 through the end of the 2023 season, the Astros' all-time record is 4,921\u20134,890 (.502). In addition to having the most postseason appearances by an expansion team, they are the only expansion era team with an all-time winning record.[14]\nFrom 1888 until 1961, Houston's professional baseball club was the minor league Houston Buffaloes. Although expansion from the National League eventually brought an MLB team to Texas in 1962, Houston officials had been making efforts to do so for years prior, with a group effort led in 1952 to buy the St. Louis Cardinals for $4.25 million, but local owners were instead chosen.[15][16] There were four men chiefly responsible for bringing Major League Baseball to Houston: journalist/promoter George Kirksey, Craig Cullinan Jr., R.E. \"Bob\" Smith, a prominent oilman and real estate magnate in Houston who like Cullinan was brought in for his financial resources, and Judge Roy Hofheinz, a former Mayor of Houston and Harris County Judge who was recruited for his salesmanship and political style. They founded the Houston Sports Association (HSA) as their vehicle for attaining a big league franchise for the city of Houston.[17]\nGiven MLB's refusal to consider expansion, Kirksey, Cullinan, Smith, and Hofheinz joined forces with would-be owners from other cities and announced the formation of a new league to compete with the established National and American Leagues. They called the new league the Continental League. Wanting to protect potential new markets, both existing leagues chose to expand from eight teams to ten. However, plans eventually fell through for the Houston franchise after the Houston Buffaloes owner, Marty Marion, could not come to an agreement with the HSA to sell the team.[18] To make matters worse, the Continental League as a whole folded in August 1960.\nHowever, on October 17, 1960, the National Leaguegranted an expansion franchise to the Houston Sports Association for them to begin play in the 1962 season. According to the Major League Baseball Constitution, the Houston Sports Association was required to obtain territorial rights from the Houston Buffaloes in order to play in the Houston area, resulting in the HSA revisiting negotiations.[19][20] Eventually, the Houston Sports Association succeeded in purchasing the Houston Buffaloes, which were at this point majority-owned by William Hopkins, on January 17, 1961.[21] The Buffs played one last minor league season as the top farm team of the Chicago Cubs in 1961 before being succeeded by the city's NL club.\nThe new Houston team was named the Colt .45s after a \"Name the Team\" contest was won by William Irving Neder. The Colt .45 was well known as \"the gun that won the west\".[22]\nThe colors selected were navy and orange. The first team was formed mostly through an expansion draft after the 1961 season. The Colt .45s and their expansion cousins, the New York Mets, took turns choosing players left unprotected by the other National League franchises.\nSimilarly, the radio broadcasting team remained with the new Houston major league franchise. Loel Passe worked alongside Gene Elston as a color commentator until he retired from broadcasting in 1976. Elston continued with the Astros until 1986.\nThe Colt .45s began their existence playing at Colt Stadium, a temporary venue built just north of the construction site of their permanent home, a domed stadium. Hofheinz and his partners believed a domed stadium was a must for MLB to be viable in Houston, given the area's oppressive humidity.\nThe Colt .45s started their inaugural season on April 10, 1962, against the Chicago Cubs with Harry Craft as the Colt .45s' manager. Bob Aspromonte scored the first run for the Colt .45s on an Al Spangler triple in the first inning.[23] They started the season with a three-game sweep of the Cubs but eventually finished eighth among the National League's ten teams. The team's best pitcher, Richard \"Turk\" Farrell, lost 20 games despite an ERA of 3.02. A starter for the Colt .45s, Farrell was primarily a relief pitcher prior to playing for Houston. He was selected to both All-Star Games in 1962.\nThe 1963 season saw more young talent mixed with seasoned veterans. Jimmy Wynn, Rusty Staub, and Joe Morgan all made their major league debuts in the 1963 season. However, Houston's position in the standings did not improve, as the Colt .45s finished in ninth place with a 66\u201396 record. The team was still building, trying to find that perfect mix to compete.[17] The 1964 campaign began on a sad note, as relief pitcher Jim Umbricht died of cancer at the age of 33 on April 8, just before Opening Day.[24] Umbricht was the only Colt .45s pitcher to post a winning record in Houston's first two seasons. He was so well liked by players and fans that the team retired his jersey number, 32, in 1965.[25]\nJust on the horizon, the structure of the new domed stadium was more prevalent and it would soon change the way that baseball was watched in Houston and around the league. On December 1, 1964, the team announced the name change from the Colt .45s to the \"Astros\".[26][27][28]\nWith Judge Roy Hofheinz now the sole owner of the franchise and the new venue complete, the renamed Astros moved into their new domed stadium, the Astrodome, in 1965. The name honored Houston's position as the center of the nation's space program\u2014NASA's new Manned Spacecraft Center had recently opened southeast of the city. The Astrodome, called the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\", did little to improve the home team's results on the field. While several \"indoor\" firsts were accomplished, the team still finished ninth in the standings. The attendance was high not because of the team's accomplishments, but because people came from miles around to see the Astrodome.\nHouston Astrodome Scoreboard pictured during a June 7, 1969 game between the Astros and CardinalsThe Astrodome in 1965\nJust as the excitement was settling down over the Astrodome, the 1966 season found something new to put the domed stadium in the spotlight once again \u2013 the field. Grass would not grow in the new park, since the roof panels had been painted to reduce the glare that was causing players on both the Astros and the visiting teams to miss routine pop flies. A new artificial turf was created called \"AstroTurf\" and Houston would be involved in yet another change in the way the game was played.[29]\nWith new manager Grady Hatton, the Astros started the 1966 season strong. By May they were in second place in the National League and looked like a team that could contend. Joe Morgan was named as a starter on the All-Star Team. The success did not last as they lost Jimmy Wynn for the season after he crashed into an outfield fence in Philadelphia and Morgan had broken his knee cap.[17] The 1967 season saw first baseman Eddie Mathews join the Astros. The slugger hit his 500th home run while in Houston. He would be traded late in the season and Doug Rader would be promoted to the big leagues. Rookie Don Wilson pitched a no-hitter on June 18. Wynn also provided some enthusiasm in 1967. The 5 ft 9 in Wynn was becoming known not only for how often he hit home runs, but also for how far he hit them. Wynn set club records with 37 home runs, and 107 RBIs. It was also in 1967 that Wynn hit his famous home run onto Interstate 75 in Cincinnati.[30] As the season came to a close, the Astros found themselves again in ninth place and with a winning percentage below .500. The team looked good on paper, but could not make it work on the field.\nApril 15, 1968, saw a pitching duel for the ages. The Astros' Don Wilson and the Mets' Tom Seaver faced each other in a battle that lasted six hours. Seaver went ten innings, allowing no walks and just two hits. Wilson went nine innings, allowing five hits and three walks. After the starters exited, eleven relievers (seven for the Mets and four for the Astros) tried to end the game. The game finally ended in the 24th inning when Aspromonte hit a shot toward Mets shortstop Al Weis. Weis had been perfect all night at short, but he was not quick enough to make the play. The ball zipped into left field, allowing Norm Miller to score.[31]\nWith baseball expansion and trades, the Astros had dramatically changed in 1969. Aspromonte was sent to the Braves and Staub was traded to the expansion Montreal Expos, in exchange for outfielder Jes\u00fas Alou and first baseman Donn Clendenon. However, Clendenon refused to report to Houston, electing to retire and take job with a pen manufacturing company. The Astros asked Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to void the trade, but he refused. Instead, he awarded Jack Billingham and a left-handed relief pitcher to the Astros to complete the trade. Cuellar was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Curt Blefary. Other new players included catcher Johnny Edwards, infielder Denis Menke and pitcher Denny Lemaster. Wilson continued to pitch brilliantly and on May 1 threw the second no-hitter of his career. In that game, he struck out 18 batters, tying what was then the all-time single-game mark. He was just 24 years of age and was second to only Sandy Koufax for career no-hit wins. Wilson's no-hitter lit the Astros' fire after a miserable month of April, and six days later the team tied a major league record by turning seven double plays in a game. By May's end, the Astros had put together a ten-game winning streak. The Houston infield tandem of Menke and Joe Morgan continued to improve, providing power at the plate and great defense. Morgan had 15 homers and stole 49 bases while Menke led the Astros with 90 RBIs. The Menke/Morgan punch was beginning to come alive, and the team was responding to Walker's management style. The Astros dominated the season series against their expansion twins, the New York Mets. In one game at New York, Denis Menke and Jimmy Wynn hit grand slams in the same inning, against a Mets team that would go on to win the World Series that same year. The Astros finished the 1969 season with a record of 81 wins, 81 losses, marking their first season of .500 ball.\nIn 1970, the Astros were expected to be a serious threat in the National League West. In June, 19-year-old C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o was called up and immediately showed signs of being a superstar. The Dominican outfielder batted .310 after being called up. Not to be outdone, Menke batted .304 and Jes\u00fas Alou batted .306. The Astros' batting average was up by 19 points compared to the season before.[30][32] The team looked good, but the Astros' ERA was up. Larry Dierker and Wilson had winning records, but the pitching staff as a whole had an off season. Houston finished in fourth place in 1970.\nThe fashion trends of the 1970s had started taking root in baseball. Long hair and loud colors were starting to appear on team uniforms, including the Astros'. In 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the same style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was navy was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue. The players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the uniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the industry \u2013 polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys zipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans, but would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the fashion world.[33]\nThe uniforms were about the only thing that did change in 1971. The acquisition of Roger Metzger from the Chicago Cubs in the off-season moved Menke to first base and Bob Watson to the outfield. The Astros got off to a slow start and the pitching and hitting averages were down. Larry Dierker was selected to the All-Star Game in 1971, but due to an arm injury he could not make it. C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o led the club with 81 RBIs and the league with 40 doubles, but batted just .264 and had 102 strikeouts in his second season with the Astros.[34] Pitcher J. R. Richard made his debut in September of the 1971 season against the Giants.\nHall of Famer Joe Morgan (1963\u20131971, 1980) was traded to Cincinnati following the 1971 season\nThe Astros' acquisition of Lee May added more power to the lineup in 1972. May, Wynn, Rader and Cede\u00f1o all had 20 or more home runs and Watson hit 16. Cede\u00f1o also led the Astros with a .320 batting average, 55 stolen bases and made spectacular plays on the field. Cede\u00f1o made his first All-Star game in 1972 and became the first Astros player in team history to hit for the cycle in August versus the Reds. The Astros finished the strike-shortened season at 84\u201369, their first winning season.[17]\nAstros fans had hoped for more of the same in 1973, but it was not to be. The Astros run production was down, even though the same five sluggers the year before were still punching the ball out of the park. Lee May led the Astros with 28 home runs and Cesar Cede\u00f1o batted .320 with 25 home runs. Bob Watson hit the .312 mark and drove in 94 runs. Doug Rader and Jimmy Wynn both had 20 or more home runs. However, injuries to their pitching staff limited the Astros to an 82\u201380 fourth-place finish. The Astros again finished in fourth place the next year under new manager Preston G\u00f3mez.[17][37]\nWith the $38 million deficit of the Astrodome, control of the Astrodomain (including the Astros)[38] was passed from Roy Hofheinz to GE Credit and Ford Motor Credit. The creditors were just interested in preserving asset value of the team, so any money spent had to be found or saved somewhere else.[39]Tal Smith returned to the Astros from the New York Yankees to find a team that needed a lot of work and did not have a lot of money. However, there would be some bright spots that would prove to be good investments in the near future.\nThe year started on a sad note. Pitcher Don Wilson was found dead in the passenger seat of his car on January 5, 1975; the cause of death was asphyxiation by carbon monoxide. Wilson was 29 years old. Wilson's number 40 was retired on April 13, 1975.[33]\nThe 1975 season saw the introduction of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. From the chest down, the uniform was a solid block of yellow, orange, and red stripes.[40] There was also a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same multi-colored stripes ran down the pant legs. Players' numbers not only appeared on the back of the jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.[33]\nBesides the bright new uniforms there were some other changes. Lee May was traded to Baltimore for much talked about rookie second baseman Rob Andrews and utility player Enos Cabell. In Baltimore, Cabell was stuck behind third baseman Brooks Robinson, but he took advantage of his opportunity in Houston and became their everyday third baseman.[41] Cabell would go on to become a big part of the team's success in later years. With May gone, Bob Watson was able to move to first base and was a bright spot in the line up, batting .324 with 85 RBI.\nThe two biggest moves the Astros made in the offseason were the acquisitions of Joe Niekro and Jos\u00e9 Cruz. The Astros bought Niekro from the Braves for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother Phil Niekro had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe was just starting to use it when he came to the Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07.[42] Acquiring Jos\u00e9 Cruz from the Cardinals was another big win.[43] Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.\nDespite high expectations, 1975 was among the Astros' worst in franchise history. Their record of 64\u201397 was far worse than even the expansion Colt .45's and would remain the worst record in franchise history until 2011. It was the worst record in baseball and manager Preston G\u00f3mez was fired late in the season and replaced by Bill Virdon. The Astros played .500 ball under Virdon in the last 34 games of the season.[33] With Virdon as the manager the Astros improved greatly in 1976 finishing in third place with an 80\u201382 record. A healthy C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o was a key reason for the Astros' success in 1976. Bob Watson continued to show consistency and led the club with a .313 average and 102 RBI. Jos\u00e9 Cruz became Houston's everyday left fielder and hit .303 with 28 stolen bases.[44][45] 1976 saw the end of Larry Dierker's playing career as an Astro, but before it was all over he would throw a no-hitter and win the 1,000th game in the Astrodome.[46] The Astros finished in third place again in 1977 with a record of 81\u201381.[33]\nOne of the big problems the Astros had in the late 1970s was that they were unable to compete in the free-agent market. Ford Motor Credit Company was still in control of the team and was looking to sell the Astros, but would not spend money on better players. Most of the talent was either farm grown or bought cheaply.\nThe 1979 season would prove to be a big turnaround in Astros history. During the offseason, the Astros attempted to fix some of their problem areas. They traded Floyd Bannister to Seattle for shortstop Craig Reynolds and acquired catcher Alan Ashby from Toronto for pitcher Mark Lemongello. Reynolds and Ashby were both solid in their positions and gave Houston some much-needed consistency.[47] The season started with a boost from pitcher Ken Forsch, who threw a no-hitter against the Braves the second game of the season.[33] In May 1979, New Jersey shipping tycoon John McMullen had agreed to buy the Astros. Now with an investor in charge, the Astros would be more likely to compete in the free-agent market.[48]\nThe Astros were playing great baseball throughout the season. Jos\u00e9 Cruz and Enos Cabell both stole 30 bases. Joe Niekro had a great year with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. J. R. Richard won 18 games and set a new personal strikeout record at 313. Joe Sambito came into his own with 22 saves as the Astros closer. Things were going as they should for a team that could win the west.[33] The Astros and Reds battled the final month of the season. The Reds pulled ahead of the Astros by a game and a half. Later that month they split a pair and the Reds kept the lead. The Astros finished with their best record to that point at 89\u201373 and 1+1\u20442 games behind the NL winner Reds.[33]\nWith Dr. McMullen as sole owner of the Astros, the team would now benefit in ways a corporation could not give them. The rumors of the Astros moving out of Houston started to crumble and the Astros were now able to compete in the free-agent market. McMullen showed the city of Houston that he too wanted a winning team, signing nearby Alvin, Texas native Nolan Ryan to the first million-dollar-a-year deal. Ryan had four career no-hitters already and had struck out 383 in one season.[33]\nJoe Morgan returned in 1980. The 1980 pitching staff was one of the best Houston ever had, with the fastball of Ryan, the knuckleball of Joe Niekro and the terrifying 6 ft 8 in frame of J. R. Richard. Teams felt lucky to face Ken Forsch, who was a double-digit winner in the previous two seasons. Richard became the first Astros pitcher to start an All-Star game. Three days later, Richard was told to rest his arm after a medical examination and on July 30 he collapsed during a workout. He had suffered a stroke after a blood clot in the arm apparently moved to his neck and cut off blood flow to the brain. Surgery was done to save his life, but the Astros had lost their ace pitcher after a 10\u20134 start with a stingy 1.89 ERA. Richard attempted a comeback, but would never again pitch a big league game.[33][49]\nAfter the loss of Richard and some offensive struggles, the Astros slipped to third place in the division behind the Dodgers and the Reds. They bounced back to first with a ten-game winning streak, but the Dodgers regained a two-game lead before arriving in Houston on September 9. The Astros won the first two games of the series to tie the Dodgers for the division lead. The Astros went on to win a third game and take the lead- with three games against the Dodgers left. The Dodgers swept the next series, forcing a one-game playoff the next day.[50] The Astros won the playoff game 7\u20131, and advanced to their first post-season.\nThe team would face the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1980 National League Championship Series. The Phillies sent out Steve Carlton in game one of the NLCS.[33][51] The Phillies would win the opener after the Astros got out to a 1\u20130 third-inning lead. Ken Forsch pitched particularly strong fourth and fifth innings, but Greg Luzinski hit a sixth-inning two-run bomb to the 300 level seats of Veterans Stadium. The Phillies added an insurance run on the way to a 3\u20131 win.[17] Houston bounced back to win games two and three. Game four went into extra innings, with the Phillies taking the lead and the win in the tenth inning. Pete Rose started a rally with a one-out single, then Luzinski doubled off the left-field wall and Rose bowled over catcher Bruce Bochy to score the go-ahead run. The Phillies got an insurance run on the way to tying the series.[17]\nRookie Phillies pitcher Marty Bystrom was sent out by Philadelphia manager Dallas Green to face veteran Nolan Ryan in Game Five. The rookie gave up a run in the first inning, then held the Astros at bay until the sixth inning. An Astros lead was lost when Bob Boone hit a two-out single in the second, but the Astros tied the game in the sixth with an Alan Ashby single scoring Denny Walling. Houston took a 5\u20132 lead in the seventh; however, the Phillies came back with five runs in the inning. The Astros came back against Tug McGraw with four singles and two two-out runs. Now in extra innings, Garry Maddox doubled in Del Unser with one out to give the Phillies an 8\u20137 lead. The Astros failed to score in the bottom of the tenth.[17][52]\nA 1981 player strike ran between June 12 and August 10. Ultimately, the strike would help the Astros get into the playoffs. Nolan Ryan and Bob Knepper picked up steam in the second half of the season. Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter on September 26 and finished the season with a 1.69 ERA. Knepper finished with an ERA of 2.18.[17] In the wake of the strike, Major League Baseball took the winners of each \"half\" season and set up a best-of-five divisional playoff. The Reds won more games than any other team in the National League, but they won neither half of the strike-divided season. The Astros finished 61\u201349 overall, which would have been third in the division behind the Reds and the Dodgers. Advancing to the playoffs as winners of the second half, Houston beat Los Angeles in their first two playoff games at home, but the Dodgers took the next three in Los Angeles to advance to the NLCS.\nBy 1982, only four players and three starting pitchers remained from the 1980 squad. The Astros were out of pennant contention by August and began rebuilding for the near future. Bill Virdon was fired as manager and replaced by original Colt .45 Bob Lillis. Don Sutton asked to be traded and was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers for cash and the team gained three new prospects, including Kevin Bass. Minor league player Bill Doran was called up in September. The Astros finished fourth in the west, but new talent was starting to appear.[17]\nBefore the 1983 season, the Astros traded Danny Heep to the Mets for pitcher Mike Scott, a 28-year-old who had struggled with New York. Art Howe sat out the 1983 season with an injury, forcing Phil Garner to third and Ray Knight to first. Doran took over at second, becoming the everyday second baseman for the next seven seasons.[53] The Astros finished third in the National League West.[17] The 1984 season started off badly when shortstop Dickie Thon was hit in the head by a pitch and was lost for the season. In September, the Astros called up rookie Glenn Davis after he posted impressive numbers in AAA. The Astros finished in second place. In 1985, Mike Scott learned a new pitch, the split-finger fastball. Scott, who was coming off of a 5\u201311 season, had found his new pitch and would become one of Houston's most celebrated hurlers. In June, Davis made the starting lineup at first base, adding power to the team. In September, Joe Niekro was traded to the Yankees for two minor league pitchers and lefty Jim Deshaies. The Astros finished in fourth place in 1985.[17]\nAfter finishing fourth in 1985, the Astros fired general manager Al Rosen and manager Bob Lillis. The former was supplanted by Dick Wagner, the man whose Reds defeated the Astros to win the 1979 NL West title. The latter was replaced by Hal Lanier who, like his manager mentor in St. Louis, Whitey Herzog, had a hard-nosed approach to managing and espoused a playing style that focused on pitching, defense, and speed rather than home runs to win games. This style of baseball, known as Whiteyball, took advantage of stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, both of which were characteristics of the Astrodome. Lanier's style of baseball took Houston by storm. Before Lanier took over, fans were accustomed to Houston's occasional slow starts, but with Lanier leading the way, Houston got off to a hot start, winning 13 of their first 19 contests.[17][54][55]\nThe Astrodome was host to the 1986 All-Star Game in which Astros Mike Scott, Kevin Bass, Glenn Davis, and Dave Smith represented the host field. The Astros kept pace with the NL West after the All-Star break. They went on a streak of five straight come-from-behind wins. Houston swept a key 3-game series over the San Francisco Giants in late September to clinch the division title. Mike Scott took the mound in the final game of the series and pitched a no-hitter \u2013 the only time in MLB history that any division was clinched via a no-hitter. Scott would finish the season with an 18\u201310 record and a Cy Young Award.[17][57][58]\nHowever, the signature game of the series was Game 6. Needing a win to get to Mike Scott (who had been dominant in the series) in Game 7, the Astros jumped off to a 3\u20130 lead in the first inning but neither team would score again until the 9th inning. In the 9th, starting pitcher Bob Knepper would give up two runs, and once again the Astros would look to Dave Smith to close it out. However, Smith would walk Gary Carter and Darryl Strawberry, giving up a sacrifice fly to Ray Knight, tying the game. Despite having the go-ahead runs on base, Smith was able to escape the inning without any further damage.\nThere was no scoring until the 14th inning when the Mets would take the lead on a Wally Backman single and an error by left fielder Billy Hatcher. The Astros would get the run back in the bottom of the 14th when Hatcher (in a classic goat-to-hero-conversion-moment) hit one of the most dramatic home runs in NLCS history, off the left-field foul pole. In the 16th inning, Darryl Strawberry doubled to lead off the inning and Ray Knight drove him home in the next at-bat. The Mets would score a total of three runs in the inning to take what appeared an insurmountable 7\u20134 lead. With their season on the line, the Astros would nonetheless rally for two runs to come to within 7\u20136. Kevin Bass came up with the tying and winning runs on base; however Jesse Orosco would strike him out, ending the game. At the time the 16-inning game held the record for the longest in MLB postseason history. The Mets won the series, 4\u20132.\nThe early 1990s were marked by the Astros' growing discontent with their home, the Astrodome. After the Astrodome was renovated for the primary benefit of the NFL's Houston Oilers (who shared the Astrodome with the Astros since the 1960s), the Astros began to grow increasingly disenchanted with the facility. Faced with declining attendance at the Astrodome and the inability of management to obtain a new stadium, in the 1991 off-season Astros management announced its intention to sell the team and move the franchise to the Washington, D.C. area. However, the move was not approved by other National League owners, thus compelling the Astros to remain in Houston. Shortly thereafter, McMullen (who also owned the NHL's New Jersey Devils) sold the team to Texas businessman Drayton McLane in 1993, who committed to keeping the team in Houston.\nShortly after McLane's arrival, which coincided with the maturation of Bagwell and Biggio, the Astros began to show signs of consistent success. After finishing second in their division in 1994 (in a strike year), 1995, and 1996, the Astros won consecutive division titles in 1997, 1998, and 1999. In the 1998 season, the Astros set a team record with 102 victories. However, each of these titles was followed by a first-round playoff elimination, in 1998 by the San Diego Padres and in 1997 and 1999 against the Atlanta Braves. The manager of these title teams was Larry Dierker, who had previously been a broadcaster and pitcher for the Astros. During this period, Bagwell, Biggio, Derek Bell, and Sean Berry earned the collective nickname \"The Killer Bs\". In later seasons, the name came to include other Astros, especially Lance Berkman.[60]\nCoinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team colors after the 1993 season in order to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow uniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and metallic gold. The \"Astros\" font on the team logo was changed to a more aggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a stylized, \"flying\" star with an open left end. It marked the first time since the team's inception that orange was not part of the team's colors. Despite general agreement that the rainbow uniforms identified with the team had become tired (and looked too much like a minor league team according to the new owners), the new uniforms and caps were never especially popular with many Astros fans.\nFinal Astros regular season game in the Astrodome on October 3, 1999\nOff the field, in 1994, the Astros hired one of the first African American general managers, former franchise player Bob Watson. Watson would leave the Astros after the 1995 season to become general manager of the New York Yankees and helped to lead the Yankees to a World Series championship in 1996. He would be replaced by Gerry Hunsicker, who until 2004 would continue to oversee the building of the Astros into one of the better and most consistent organizations in the Major Leagues.\nHowever, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s, McLane (like McMullen before him) wanted his team out of the Astrodome and was asking the city to build the Astros a new stadium. When things did not progress quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly finalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned to move them to Northern Virginia. However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a stadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give Houston another chance to grant his stadium wish. Houston voters, having already lost the Houston Oilers in a similar situation, responded positively via a stadium referendum and the Astros stayed put.\nThe 2000 season saw a move to a new stadium. Originally to be named The Ballpark at Union Station due to being located on the site of Union Station, it was renamed Enron Field by the season opening after the naming rights were sold to energy corporation Enron. The stadium was to feature a retractable roof, a particularly useful feature with unpredictable Houston weather. The ballpark also featured more intimate surroundings than the Astrodome. In 2002, naming rights were purchased by Houston-based Minute Maid, after Enron went bankrupt. The park was built on the grounds of the old Union Station. A locomotive moves across the outfield and whistles after home runs, paying homage to a Houston history which had 11 railroad company lines running through the city by 1860. The ballpark previously contained quirks such as \"Tal's Hill\", which was a hill in deep center field on which a flagpole stood, all in fair territory. Over the years, many highlight reel catches have been made by center fielders running up the hill to make catches. Tal's Hill was removed in the 2016\u20132017 offseason and the center field wall was moved in to 409 feet (125 m), which the team hoped would generate more home runs.\nWith the change in location also came a change in attire. Gone were the blue and gold uniforms of the 1990s in favor of a more \"retro\" look with pinstripes, a traditional baseball font, and the colors of brick red, sand and black. These colors were chosen because ownership originally wanted to rename the team the Houston Diesels.[61] The \"shooting star\" logo was modified but still retained its definitive look.\nThe Astros moved into Minute Maid Park in 2000\nAfter two fairly successful seasons without a playoff appearance, the Astros were early favorites to win the 2004 NL pennant. They added star pitcher Andy Pettitte to a roster that already included standouts like Lance Berkman and Jeff Kent as well as veterans Bagwell and Biggio. Roger Clemens, who had retired after the 2003 season with the New York Yankees, agreed to join former teammate Pettitte on the Astros for 2004. The one-year deal included unique conditions, such as the option for Clemens to stay home in Houston on select road trips when he wasn't scheduled to pitch. Despite the early predictions for success, the Astros had a mediocre 44\u201344 record at the All-Star break. A lack of run production and a poor record in close games were major issues. After being booed at the 2004 All-Star Game held in Houston, manager Jimy Williams was fired and replaced by Phil Garner, a star on the division-winning 1986 Astros. The Astros enjoyed a 46\u201326 record in the second half of the season under Garner and earned the NL wild-card spot. The Astros defeated the Braves 3\u20132 in the Division Series, but would lose the National League Championship Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Clemens earned a record seventh Cy Young Award in 2004. Additionally, the mid-season addition of Carlos Beltr\u00e1n in a trade with the Kansas City Royals helped the Astros tremendously in their playoff run. Despite midseason trade rumors, Beltr\u00e1n would prove instrumental to the team's hopes, hitting eight home runs in the postseason. Though he had asserted a desire to remain with the Astros, Beltr\u00e1n signed a long-term contract with the New York Mets on January 9, 2005.\nIn 2005, the Astros started poorly and found themselves with a 15\u201330 record in late May. The Houston Chronicle had written them off with a tombstone emblazoned with \"RIP 2005 Astros\". However, from that low point until the end of July, Houston went 42\u201317 and found themselves in the lead for an NL wild card spot. July saw the best single-month record in the club's history at 22\u20137. Offensive production had increased greatly after a slow start in the first two months. The Astros had also developed an excellent pitching staff, anchored by Roy Oswalt (20\u201312, 2.94), Andy Pettitte (17\u20139, 2.39), and Roger Clemens (13\u20138 with a league-low ERA of only 1.87). The contributions of the other starters\u2014Brandon Backe (10\u20138, 4.76) and rookie starters Ezequiel Astacio (3\u20136, 5.67) and Wandy Rodr\u00edguez (10\u201310, 5.53)\u2014were less remarkable, but enough to push the Astros into position for a playoff run. The Astros won a wild card berth on the final day of the regular season, becoming the first team since the World Series champion 1914 Boston Braves to qualify for the postseason after being 15 games under .500.[62]\n2005 National League championship banner at Minute Maid Park\nThe Astros won the National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, 3\u20131, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6\u20131, Lance Berkman hit an eighth-inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6\u20135. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the 15th inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke, hit a home run to left field to send the Astros to a 7\u20136 victory. The National League Championship Series featured a rematch of the 2004 NLCS. The Astros lost the first game in St. Louis, but would win the next three games. Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-run home run to Albert Pujols, forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance. Roy Oswalt was named NLCS MVP, having gone 2\u20130 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Honorary National League President Bill Giles presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C. Giles Trophy (named for his father) for winning the series; the younger Giles had been one of the founders of the original Colt 45 team in 1962, while his father Warren had been president of the National League from 1951 to 1969.[63]\nThe Astros faced the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. Chicago had been considered the slight favorite but would win all four games, the first two at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago and the final two in Houston. Game 3 marked the first World Series game held in the state of Texas, and was the longest game in World Series history, lasting 5 hours and 41 minutes.\nThis World Series was marked by a controversy involving the Minute Maid Park roof. MLB and Commissioner Bud Selig insisted that the Astros must play with the roof open, which mitigated the intensity and enthusiasm of the cheering Astros fans.[64]\nIn the 2006 offseason, the team signed Preston Wilson and moved Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure of Jeff Bagwell. The Astros renewed the contract with Clemens and traded two minor league prospects to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for left-handed hitter Aubrey Huff. By August, Preston Wilson complained about his playing time after the return of Luke Scott from AAA Round Rock. The Astros released Wilson and he was signed by St. Louis. A dramatic season end included wins in 10 of their last 12 games, but the Astros missed a playoff appearance when they lost the final game of the season to the Atlanta Braves.\nOn October 31, the Astros declined a contract option on Jeff Bagwell for 2007, ending his 15-year Astros career and leading to his retirement. Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte filed for free agency. On December 12, the Astros traded Willy Taveras, Taylor Buchholz, and Jason Hirsh to the Colorado Rockies for Rockies pitchers Jason Jennings and Miguel Asencio. A trade with the White Sox, involving the same three Astros in exchange for Jon Garland, had been nixed a few days earlier when Buchholz reportedly failed a physical. In the end, Taveras continued to develop and Hirsh had a strong 2007 rookie campaign, while Jennings was often injured and generally ineffective.\nOn April 28, 2007, the Astros purchased the contract of top minor league prospect Hunter Pence. He debuted that night, getting a hit and scoring a run. By May 2007, the Astros had suffered one of their worst losing streaks (10 games). On June 28, second baseman Craig Biggio became the 27th MLB player to accrue 3,000 career hits. Biggio needed three hits to reach 3,000 and ended the night with a total of five hits. That night, Carlos Lee hit a towering walk-off grand slam in the 11th inning. Lee later quipped to the media that \"he had hit a walk-off grand slam and he got second billing\", considering Biggio's achievement. On July 24, Biggio announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He hit a grand slam in that night's game which broke a 3\u20133 tie and led to an Astros win. In Biggio's last at bat, he grounded out to Chipper Jones of the Atlanta Braves.\nThe Astros regressed in 2008 and 2009, finishing with records of 86\u201375 and 74\u201388, respectively. Manager Cecil Cooper was fired after the 2009 season. At the lowest point of the regression, child admission was free.\nOn July 30, 2011, the Astros traded OF Hunter Pence, the team's 2010 leader in home runs, to the Philadelphia Phillies. On July 31, they traded OF Michael Bourn to the Atlanta Braves. On September 17, the Astros recorded their first 100-loss season in franchise history, ending the season eleven days later with an 8\u20130 home loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Cardinals pitcher Chris Carpenter pitched a two-hit complete game shutout. The Cardinals would go on to win the National League Wild Card, before beating the Texas Rangers in the World Series. Lance Berkman, who was now a Cardinal, was a key player in their championship victory. The Astros finished with a record of 56\u2013106, the worst single-season record in franchise history (a record which would be broken the following season).\nIn November 2010, Drayton McLane announced that the Astros were being put up for sale. McLane stated that because the Astros were one of the few franchises in Major League Baseball with only one family as the owners, he was planning his estate. McLane was 75 years old as of November 2011.[69] In March 2011, local Houston businessman Jim Crane emerged as the front-runner to purchase the franchise. In the 1980s, Crane founded an air freight business which later merged with CEVA Logistics, and later founded Crane Capital Group. McLane and Crane had a previous handshake agreement for the franchise in 2008, but Crane abruptly changed his mind and broke off discussions. Crane also attempted to buy the Chicago Cubs in 2008 and the Texas Rangers during their 2010 bankruptcy auction.[70] Crane came under scrutiny because of previous allegations of discriminatory hiring practices regarding women and minorities, among other issues. This delayed MLB's approval process. In the summer of 2011, Crane claimed those issues had been resolved, and suggested that the delays were baseball's attempt to move the Astros to the American League.[71] In October later that year, Crane met personally with MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, in a meeting that was described as \"constructive\".[72]\nOn November 15, 2011, it was announced that Crane had agreed to move the franchise to the American League for the 2013 season. The move was part of an overall divisional realignment of MLB, with the National and American leagues each having 15 teams in three geographically balanced divisions. Crane was given a $70 million concession by MLB for agreeing to the switch; the move was a condition for the sale to the new ownership group.[73] Two days later, the Astros were officially sold to Crane for $615 million after the other owners unanimously voted in favor of the sale.[6] It was also announced that 2012 would be the last season for the Astros in the NL.[74] After over fifty years of the Astros being a part of the National League, this move was unpopular with many Astros fans.[75][76] In December 2011, Jeff Luhnow was named general manager.\nIn 2012, the Astros were eliminated from the playoffs before September 5. On September 27, the Astros named Bo Porter to be the manager for the 2013 season.\nOn October 3, the Astros ended over 50 years of NL play with a 5\u20134 loss to the Chicago Cubs and began to look ahead to join the American League. Winning only 20 road games during the entire season, the Astros finished with a 55\u2013107 record, the worst record in all of Major League Baseball for the 2012 season, and surpassing the 2011 season for the worst record in Astros history.\nOn November 2, 2012, the Astros unveiled their new look in preparation for their move to the American League for the 2013 season. The navy and orange uniform returned to the original 1960s team colors, and debuted a new version of the classic navy hat with a white \"H\" over an orange star.[77]\nOn November 6, 2012, the Astros hired former Cleveland Indians director of baseball operations David Stearns as the team's new assistant general manager.[78]\nThe Houston Astros played their first game as an American League team on March 31, 2013, where they were victorious over their in-state division competitor, the Texas Rangers, with a score of 8\u20132.\nOn September 29, the Astros completed their first year in the American League, losing 5\u20131 in a 14-inning game to the New York Yankees. The Astros finished the season with a 51\u2013111 record (a franchise-worst) with a season-ending 15-game losing streak, again surpassing their worst record from the previous season. The team finished 45 games behind the division winner Oakland Athletics, further adding to their futility. This marked three consecutive years that the Astros had lost more than 100 games in a single season. They also became the first team to have the first overall pick in the draft three years in a row.\nIn February 2014, Nolan Ryan rejoined the Astros front office as assistant to owner Jim Crane, GM Jeff Luhnow and president of business operations Reid Ryan. From 2004 through 2008 he worked as a special assistant to the GM.\n[81]\nIn 2015, Dallas Keuchel led the AL with 20 victories, going 15\u20130 at home, an MLB record. Key additions to the team included Scott Kazmir and SS Carlos Correa who hit 22 home runs after being called up in June 2015. Second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve remained the star of the Astros' offense. On July 30, the Astros picked up Mike Fiers and Carlos G\u00f3mez from the Milwaukee Brewers. Fiers threw the 11th no-hitter in Astros history on August 21 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Houston got the final AL playoff spot and faced the Yankees in the Wild Card Game on October 6 at New York. They defeated the Yankees 3\u20130, but lost to the Kansas City Royals in the American League Division Series.\nThe Astros split the first two games of the ALDS best-of-five series in Kansas City. The Astros won the first game at Minute Maid to take a 2\u20131 lead in the ALDS. In Game 4, after 7 innings, the Astros had a 6\u20132 lead. In the top half of the eighth inning, which took about 45 minutes to end, the Royals had taken a 7\u20136 lead with a series of consecutive base hits. The Astros suffered a 9\u20136 loss and the ALDS was tied at 2\u20132. Then the series went back to Kansas City, where the Royals clinched the series in the fifth game, 7\u20132.\nThe Astros entered the 2016 season as the favorites to win the AL West after a promising 2015 season. After a bad start to their season, going just 7\u201317 in April, the Astros bounced back and went on to have a winning record in their next four months, including an 18\u20138 record in June. But after going 12\u201315 in September, the Astros were eliminated from playoff contention. They finished in third place in the American League West Division with a final record of 84\u201378.\nThe season was marked by the Astros 4\u201315 record against their in-state division rival (and eventual division winner) Texas Rangers. The Astros finished the 2016 season 11 games behind the Rangers.\nIn 2014, Sports Illustrated predicted the Astros would win the 2017 World Series through their strategic rebuilding process.[83][84] As of June 9, 2017 the Astros were 41\u201316, which gave them a 13.5-game lead over the rest of their division and comfortable possession of the best record in the entire league. This was the best start in the Astros' 55-year history. The Astros entered the All-Star Break with an American League-best 60\u201329 record, a 16-game lead in the division, and one game shy of the best record in MLB, which had just barely slipped to the Dodgers right before the All-Star Break.\nThe Houston Astros began wearing this patch during the 2017 season as the Houston area recovered from the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey.\nWith Hurricane Harvey causing massive flooding throughout Houston and southeast Texas, the Astros' three-game series against the Texas Rangers for August 29\u201331, was relocated to Tropicana Field (home of the Tampa Bay Rays), in St. Petersburg, Florida.[85] As the area recovered from the hurricane, many residents rallied around the Astros, who adopted the mantra \"Houston Strong\". They wore a patch on their jerseys with the mantra for the remainder of the season.[86][87]\nAt the August 31 waiver-trade deadline GM Jeff Luhnow acquired veteran starting pitcher and Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander to bolster the starting rotation.[88] Verlander won each of his 5 regular season starts with the Astros, yielding only 4 runs over this stretch. He carried his success into the playoffs, posting a record of 4\u20131 in his 6 starts, and throwing a complete game in Game 2 of the ALCS. Verlander was named the 2017 ALCS MVP.[89]\nThe Astros clinched their first division title as a member of the American League West division, and first division title overall since 2001. They also became the first team in Major League history to win three different divisions: National League West in 1980 and 1986, National League Central from 1997 to 1999 and 2001, and American League West in 2017.[90] On September 29, the Astros won their 100th game of the season, the second time the Astros finished a season with over 100 wins, the first being in 1998. They finished 101\u201361, with a 21-game lead in the division, and faced the Red Sox in the first round of the AL playoffs. The Astros defeated the Red Sox three games to one, and advanced to the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. The Astros won the ALCS four games to three, and advanced to the World Series to play against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Astros defeated the Dodgers in the deciding seventh game of the World Series, winning the first championship in franchise history.[91]\nThe victory was especially meaningful for the Houston area, which was rebuilding after Hurricane Harvey.[92] The city of Houston celebrated the team's accomplishment with a parade on the afternoon of November 3, 2017. Houston police chief Art Acevedo estimated at least 750,000 people attended the parade.[93]\nOn November 16, 2017, Jos\u00e9 Altuve was named the American League Most Valuable Player, capping off a season in which he accumulated 200 hits for the fourth consecutive season, led the majors with a .346 BA, and was the unquestioned clubhouse leader of the World Series champions.\nOn September 26, 2018, the Astros' second consecutive AL West division championship was clinched with a victory by the Seattle Mariners over the Oakland A's. For the third time in franchise history, and second consecutive season, the team won over 100 games; they finished the regular season 103\u201359 (a new franchise record) by sweeping a double-header against the Baltimore Orioles on September 29, 2018. The Astros swept the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS to advance to the ALCS to face the league-leading Boston Red Sox (who finished the season 108\u201354.) After a 7\u20132 victory in Game 1 of the ALCS, the Astros dropped the next four games, and Boston advanced to the World Series.\nIn the offseason, the Astros signed veteran outfielder Michael Brantley, and catcher Robinson Chirinos. At the trade deadline on July 31, 2019, Houston acquired another veteran starting pitcher and Cy Young award winner Zack Greinke to bolster the starting rotation.[94] On September 22, the Astros clinched their third consecutive AL West division title. They finished the season with a record of 107\u201355, the best in franchise history, and the best record in MLB. They became the first team since the 2002\u20132004 New York Yankees to have 3 consecutive 100-win seasons. They also became the first team in MLB history to have three consecutive 100-loss seasons and three consecutive 100-win seasons in the same decade.\nEntering the playoffs as the top-seeded team in both leagues, they defeated the AL Wild Card winner Tampa Bay Rays in five games in the ALDS, advancing to the ALCS for the third year in a row to face the New York Yankees. In Game 6 at Minute Maid Park, Jose Altuve hit a walk-off home run to win the pennant and send the team to its third World Series appearance. However, they lost the 2019 World Series to the Washington Nationals in seven games, taking three games in Washington but losing all four of their games at home.\nOn November 12, 2019, Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich wrote an article in The Athletic detailing allegations that the Astros had used cameras to engage in potentially illicit sign stealing against opponents, relying on allegations from former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers as a public source and other allegations from unnamed sources.[95] The Astros were alleged to have used scouts watching catchers' signs in real time behind the dugout at Minute Maid Park to crack the signs and banging a trash can loudly to indicate what kind of pitch was coming. The scandal rippled through the baseball world as videos that appeared to clearly show the scheme were published.[96] Further allegations regarding other means of relaying signs, such as whistling, surfaced in subsequent weeks.[97] MLB and CommissionerRob Manfred announced a sweeping investigation into the allegations.[98]\nOn January 13, 2020, MLB announced that its investigation found that the Astros did use cameras and video monitors to steal signs of opposing catchers and signal to hitters throughout the 2017 regular season and postseason, and at least part of the 2018 season.[99] The investigation found no evidence of sign stealing in their pennant-winning 2019 season.[100] The report said that Alex Cora, then the Astros bench coach, Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, and other unnamed players were involved in developing the scheme. It said Hinch \"neither devised the banging scheme nor participated in it,\" but did not stop it or tell Cora he disapproved of it.[100]\nManfred announced that manager A. J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were suspended for one year, the team would be fined $5 million (the maximum allowed under MLB rules), and the team would lose its top two draft picks in both the 2020 and 2021 MLB Drafts.[99] About an hour after MLB's announcement, Astros owner Jim Crane announced he had terminated both Hinch and Luhnow, saying he was unaware of the scheme and \"extraordinarily troubled and upset\", and concluded, \"We need to move forward with a clean slate. [We] will not have this happen again on my watch.\"[101] In a statement, Luhnow denied knowledge of the scheme. Hinch issued a statement saying, \"While the evidence consistently showed I didn't endorse or participate in the sign stealing practices, I failed to stop them and I am deeply sorry.\"[102]\nThe scandal had repercussions around baseball. Cora was implicated in the report but Manfred withheld a decision on his punishment until the completion of a separate investigation into electronic sign stealing in 2018, when Cora was manager of the Red Sox.[103] However, the report led the Red Sox to dismiss Cora two days after it was published,[104] and the Mets did the same with Beltran, who had been hired as manager shortly before the original story.[105]\nOn January 29, 2020, the Astros announced they hired Dusty Baker as their new manager to replace Hinch.[106][107]James Click was hired to replace Lunhow as general manager on February 2.[108]\nExpectations for a full 2020 season were dashed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced Major League Baseball to play a 60 game season that would take place from July to September with no fans in attendance (which was later changed for the NLCS and World Series). The Astros were hampered by injuries to players such as Justin Verlander, Yordan Alvarez, and Roberto Osuna, who each suffered season-ending injuries. As such, the Astros had to rely a plethora of young arms such as Cristian Javier to go alongside veterans in Lance McCullers Jr. and Zack Greinke to accompany an offense that had just one .300 batter in Michael Brantley. The Astros went 29\u201331, but finished second place in the AL West to qualify for the postseason as part of the decision by MLB to have eight postseason teams in each league for 2020 to accompany a shortened season. The Astros defeated two division champions in the Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics to become the first team since the 1998\u20132001 New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series four times in a row, as well as the first team with a losing regular season record to win a postseason series. In the ALCS, the Astros lost to the Tampa Bay Rays despite forcing a Game 7 after losing the first three games.\nThe 2021 season was the first to be played with fans in the stands for the regular season since the scandal broke. Rabid opposition for a number of fanbases went hand in hand with the challenge of replacing departed players George Springer and Josh Reddick. By the time of the break for the 2021 MLB All-Star Game, the Astros were 55\u201336 and contending for a top spot in the postseason, complete with four All-Star selections in Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, Michael Brantley, and Ryan Pressly. On September 30, the Astros clinched their fourth AL West title in the span of five seasons (which was the first time they had won four division titles in five seasons since the 1998\u20132001 teams); the six playoff appearances in seven seasons is the best span in franchise history. Yuli Gurriel became the second Astro to win the batting title, doing so at the age of 37 with a batting average of .319.[109] The Astros beat the Chicago White Sox in the American League Division Series to advance to their fifth consecutive ALCS, a feat matched by only two teams in LCS history and the first since the Atlanta Braves of the 1990s (having made all eight contested NLCS from 1991 to 1999). Upon playing together in Game 3 of the 2021 American League Championship Series, Altuve, Correa, Gurriel, and Bregman set a new record for most games played together by four teammates at any position in MLB history, with that game being the 64th between the core four.[110] On October 22, the Astros prevailed 5\u20130 in Game 6 over the Boston Red Sox to win their third pennant in the last five seasons.[111] They went on to lose the 2021 World Series to the Atlanta Braves in six games.\nThe 2022 season opened without Carlos Correa at shortstop for the first time since 2016 as he left for the Minnesota Twins in free agency. Rookie shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a made the Opening Day start and manned the position for the entire season. The Astros clinched the division on September 19, their second consecutive division title and their fifth in six seasons. Justin Verlander had a resurgent and historic season, leading the league with a 1.75 ERA en route to his third career Cy Young Award. Upon entering the postseason, the Astros swept the Mariners in three tightly contested ALDS games to advance to their American League record sixth consecutive ALCS. The Astros swept the Yankees to advance to the World Series for the second year in a row and fourth in six seasons. On November 2, 2022, in Game 4 of the 2022 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies at the Citizens Bank Park, the Astros became the first team to throw a combined no-hitter in postseason history, and the second team to throw a no-hitter in World Series history after Don Larsen's perfect game with the New York Yankees in 1956.[112][113] The Astros went on to defeat the Phillies in six games, earning their second World Series title.[114]Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the Series MVP Award; the first rookie position player in MLB history to do so, and the first rookie shortstop in history to hit a home run in the World Series.[115] The Astros became the first team to have a winning percentage of .622 (or better) in a six-season span (2017-2022) with multiple World Series titles since the 1953-1958 New York Yankees, and they became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing it the previous year.\n[116]\nDuring the 2022-23 offseason, Baker's contract was renewed for another year, while Click parted ways with the team following a breakdown of contractual negotiations. In February 2023, Dana Brown was hired as the new general manager for the Astros.[117][118]\nHouston's MLB franchise debuted as the Colt .45s in 1962, and the original home uniforms featured a navy pistol with orange smoke coming out of the barrel to form the \"C\" in \"Colts\". The road uniforms featured the city name written in navy block letters with orange trim, and the flag of Texas patch was placed on the left sleeve. Caps were all-navy featuring \".45s\" in orange letters in front.[40]\nRenamed the Astros and moving to the Astrodome in 1965, they took to the field in home uniforms featuring the \"shooting star\" design. The uniforms initially featured \"Astros\" in navy with orange trim, and the cap now sported an orange star with \"H\" in block serif letters. The road uniforms remained the same save for the Astros logo replacing the Texas flag (the same logo was also applied on the home uniforms).[40]\nIn 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the same style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was navy was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue. The players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the uniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the industry \u2013 polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys zipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans, but would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the fashion world.[33]\nThe 1975 season saw the introduction of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. From the chest down, the uniform was a solid block of yellow, orange, and red stripes.[40] There was also a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same multi-colored stripes ran down the pant legs. Players' numbers not only appeared on the back of the jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980, though it underwent a few minor modifications with the navy star and number style.[33]\nAlso in 1980, the Astros debuted a significantly cleaner uniform, relegating the rainbows to the sleeves. The design was initially worn on the road (with the original rainbow uniform relegated to home games), but in 1982 the rainbow shoulder look began appearing on select home games as well. In addition, the navy cap returned with this uniform and the orange cap was eventually retired in 1983. By 1987, this uniform became the Astros' primary look, retiring the original rainbow uniforms. When it first unveiled, the rainbow shoulder uniform was light grey, but by 1982, the fabric was changed to cream. A white version was added for home games that same year. Prior to the 1989 season, the pullover design was retired and buttons and belts returned to this uniform.[40][33]\nCoinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team colors after the 1993 season in order to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow uniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and metallic gold. The \"Astros\" font on the team logo was changed to a more aggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a stylized, \"flying\" star with an open left end.\nBoth the home and road uniforms featured a star substituting for the penultimate letter \"O\" in both \"Astros\" (home) and \"Houston\" (road); the road uniform was later tweaked in 1997 with the star now affixed next to the word \"Houston\". The letters were written in a more futuristic manner. The Astros also wore midnight blue alternates with \"Astros\" in white with gold trim, changed in 1997 to only feature the flying star logo. The midnight blue cap featured the flying star logo. It also marked the first time since 1982 that the Astros wore grey uniforms on the road.[40][33]\nMoving to Minute Maid Park (originally Enron Field) in 2000, the Astros took to the field wearing vintage-inspired uniforms. For the first time, navy was not part of the team's palette, and the Astros uniforms featured brick red, sand and black colors. The colors were inspired by the location of their new ballpark which formerly housed a railroad depot.\nPrimary home uniforms featured black pinstripes with \"Astros\" in black script letters and numbers in red. The road uniforms sported \"Houston\" in red script letters and black numbers. Alternate white uniforms without pinstripes featured all letters in brick red with sand trim, initially with the brick red star logo on the left chest before switching to the \"Astros\" wordmark by 2002. The Astros also wore black alternate home and road uniforms, with \"Houston\" (road) and \"Astros\" (home) emblazoned in front, but switched to brick red alternates by 2002. The letters on both uniforms are in sand with brick red trim. Black caps with the updated star in red became the primary cap while a red cap with the sand star was used as an alternate.[40][33]\nIn 2013, the Astros returned to the classic navy and orange look of previous eras. Both uniforms featured the city name (road) and team name (home) in block navy letters with orange trim, along with numbers on the left chest. Piping was also added in front. The orange alternate contained the team name and numbers in navy with white trim. The Astros also wore navy uniforms with the orange rainbow stripes along the side; the front originally featured the \"H\" star before replacing it with \"Astros\" in orange in 2016. Navy caps with the \"H\" and orange star returned as the team's primary cap, while a navy cap with orange brim was used on select games. Until 2015, the Astros also wore all-orange caps with the home uniforms, and from 2016 to 2018, the navy alternates were paired occasionally with an orange cap with navy brim.[40][33] While the navy alternates are usually worn on Sunday home games, in recent years, it became the preferred uniform during Framber Valdez's starts regardless of it being a home or road game.[120]\nIn 2022, the Astros were one of seven additional teams to wear Nike's \"City Connect\" uniforms. The predominantly navy uniform incorporated the \"Space City\" wordmark in homage to NASA's \"worm\" logo; the lettering and numbers also incorporated said style. The uniform also added various elements from the \"Tequila sunrise\" uniforms of the 1970s, including numerals on the right leg and red/orange/yellow gradients on the piping and socks. The left sleeve patch has the modified Texas flag recolored to the Astros' navy and orange motif, with the \"H-star\" logo replacing the white star. All-navy caps feature the modified \"H-star\" logo incorporating a planet in orbit. This uniform is usually worn on Monday home games.[121]\nTwo awards are presented each year, one to a Houston Astro and one to a St. Louis Cardinal, each of whom exemplifies Kile's virtues of being \"a good teammate, a great friend, a fine father and a humble man.\" The winner is selected by each local chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[123]\nWhile not officially retired, the Astros have not reissued number 57 since 2002, when former Astros pitcher Darryl Kile died as an active player with the St. Louis Cardinals. The number 42 is retired by Major League Baseball in honor of Jackie Robinson.\nHouston Astros Hall of Famers\nAffiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\nNames in bold received the award based primarily on their work as broadcasters for the Colt .45s or Astros.\nOn January 26, 2019, the team announced plans for a team Hall of Fame along with an inaugural class of inductees (including all retired numbers and members of the 2012 Walk of Fame), complete with an orange jacket and renderings for each of the inductees. The Astros Hall of Fame (with sponsorship by Houston Methodist) is currently located in the former Home Run Alley area of the ballpark under the new name of Hall of Fame Alley, beginning in March that revealed a series of plaques on Hall of Fame weekend on August 2 and induction the next day.[125] A display was installed in the Union Station lobby on January 31 that included the jerseys and hats of the first class of inductees. The 2020 season belayed induction of the second group of Hall of Fame members until August 7 of the 2021 season.[126] While there was no class of 2021, the committee dedicated to electing a broad representation of Astros did elect a class of 2022 for August of the impending season, selecting Terry Puhl and Tal Smith as the next inductees into the Astros Hall.[127][128][129][130]\nDuring interleague play, the winner of the 6-game series was awarded the Silver Boot. A 30-inch (760 mm) tall display of a size-15 cowboy boot cast in silver, complete with a custom, handmade spur. If the series was split (3\u20133), the winner was the club which scored the most runs over the course of the series.\nIn 2013, the Astros joined the American League West with the Rangers and changed their rivalry from an interleague to an intra-division rivalry, the Astros played their first game in the American League against the Rangers on Sunday Night Baseball that season. In 2015, both teams made the playoffs and were in a tight division race during most of the season.[134]\nThe series between the Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers had initially begun as a divisional matchup but following Houston's realignment to the American League, the rivalry regained intensity as the two teams played one another in the 2017 World Series in which the Astros controversially won the championship in 7 games. Animosity was quick to grow further after the Astros' widely publicized sign stealing scandal had drawn negative attention to the organization after it was revealed the team had utilized a complex system to steal pitch signs, particularly during the 2017 World Series. As a result of the scandal, hostility grew immensely between the two teams and their fans.[135] The Dodgers lead the all time series 400-334, both teams are tied in postseason wins 6-6.\nThe rivalry between the Astros and the New York Yankees emerged in the mid-2010s after the Astros moved to the American League and eventually ascended to title contenders. The two teams have met in four postseason rounds, all of which were won by Houston. However, like the Astros' rivalry with the Dodgers, animosity grew immediately after the Astros were revealed to have stolen signs during their 2017 championship season, as well as the Yankees' inability to overcome Houston in the playoffs despite fielding equally strong rosters.[136] Both teams are tied all-time with 43 wins apiece, but the Astros own a 13\u20135 postseason record.\nFairly recently, the Astros have grown an increasingly competitive rivalry with the Seattle Mariners as both teams have fought handily for control of the division. The resurgence of the Mariners to playoff contention in the early 2020s has fueled the rivalry in competition as the Mariners have often finished within 5 games of the Astros in the division for the past three seasons. The 2022 season saw the Mariners return to playoff success, winning their first series since 2001.[137] The Mariners and Astros were set to face off in the ALDS, but Houston would go on to win the series in a 0-3 sweep. Despite the lone playoff meeting, both teams have grown a recent history of hitting one another with pitches, and even instigating multiple brawls between players.[138] The series was very lopsided in favor of the Astros for multiple decades as Houston leads the all-time regular season series 119-73, including a 3-0 lead in the postseason.\nSince 2013, the Astros' flagship radio station is KBME, Sportstalk 790 AM (a Fox Sports Radio affiliate). Previously, the team had a partnership with KTRH (740 AM) which went from 1999 to 2012 (both stations are owned by iHeartMedia). This change suddenly made it difficult for listeners outside of Houston itself to hear the Astros, as KTRH runs 50 kilowatts of power day and night, and KBME runs only five kilowatts. As a result, KTRH is audible across much of Central, East, and South Texas, whereas KBME can only be heard in Houston, especially after dark. Milo Hamilton, a veteran voice who was on the call for Hank Aaron's 715th career home run in 1974, retired at the end of the 2012 season, after broadcasting play-by-play for the Astros since 1985. Dave Raymond and Brett Dolan shared play-by-play duty for road games, while Raymond additionally worked as Hamilton's color analyst (while Hamilton called home games only for the past few seasons before his retirement); they were not retained and instead brought in Robert Ford and Steve Sparks to begin broadcasting for the 2013 season.[139]\nSpanish language radio play-by-play is handled by Francisco Romero, and his play-by-play partner is Alex Trevi\u00f1o, a former backup catcher for the club.\nDuring the 2012 season Astros games on television were announced by Bill Brown and Jim Deshaies. In the seven seasons before then, Astros games were broadcast on television by Fox Sports Houston, with select games shown on broadcast TV by KTXH. As part of a ten-year, $1 billion deal with Comcast that includes a majority stake jointly held by the Astros and the Houston Rockets, Houston Astros games moved to the new Comcast SportsNet Houston at the beginning of the 2013 season.[140] On September 27, 2013 CSN Houston filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and surprising the Astros who own the largest stake.[141] After being brought out of bankruptcy by DirecTV Sports Networks and AT&T, the channel's name was changed to Root Sports Southwest then later AT&T SportsNet Southwest.\nIn April 1977, the Houston Astros introduced their first mascot, Chester Charge. Created by Ed Henderson, Chester Charge was a Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh-inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, \"Charge!\" [142]\nThe Astros' current mascot is Orbit, a lime-green outer-space creature wearing an Astros jersey with antennae extending into baseballs. Orbit was the team's official mascot from the 1990 through the 1999 seasons. For the 2000 season, a rabbit named Junction Jack was introduced as the team's mascot with the move from the Astrodome to then Enron Field. (Junction Jack had two \"relatives\", Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, who were not official mascots). Orbit returned after a 13-year hiatus on November 2, 2012, at the unveiling of the Astros' new look for their 2013 debut in the American League. The name Orbit pays homage to Houston's association with NASA and nickname Space City.[143]\n^The team's official colors are blue and orange, according to the team's mascot (Orbit)'s official website.[1]",

It was not until the Edwardian era that the title prime minister was constitutionally recognised.[23] The prime minister still holds the office of first lord by constitutional convention,[24] the only exceptions being Lords Chatham (1766\u20131768) and Salisbury (1885\u20131886, 1886\u20131892, 1895\u20131902).[25]\n^Pitt, for the first five days of his premiership (30 July \u2013 4 August 1766), served as a Member of Parliament for Bath.

        "context": "\nIn AD 80, the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus recorded that in Jerusalem, while Ventidius Cumanus was procurator of Judea (AD 48\u201352), a Roman soldier mooned Jewish pilgrims at the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem who had gathered for Passover, and \"spake such words as you might expect upon such a posture\", causing a riot in which youths threw stones at the soldiers, who then called in reinforcements. The pilgrims panicked, and the ensuing stampede reportedly resulted in the deaths of thousands of Jews.[2] According to Josephus, \"upwards of ten thousand\"[3] and more than twenty thousand[4] people perished in the event, though these numbers may have been exaggerated.[5]\n11 October 1711: 245 people were killed in a crush on the Guilloti\u00e8re bridge (Pont de la Guilloti\u00e8re [fr]) in Lyon, France, when a large crowd returning from a festival on the other side of the Rh\u00f4ne became trapped against an obstruction in the middle of the bridge caused by a collision between a carriage and a cart.[6]\n30 May 1770: At least 133 people died when a fireworks display at what is now the Place de la Concorde in Paris, a celebration of the wedding of the future Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, set mannequins and other decorations aflame, leading to a panic in which many were trampled and others drowned in the adjacent Seine. Some historians have put the total death toll up to 3,000.[7]\nA crush occurred during admissions into Bell Street Hall for an upcoming promenade. The main entrance for the music hall was a downward flight of stairs with a set of inward opening gates. When the gates were opened, the force of the crowd pushed those in front down the areaway, which caused a pile-up that ultimately killed 20 people, three-quarters being between the ages of 12 and 18.[10][11]\n19 women and children were killed in a crowd crush and resulting stairs collapse in a synagogue in during the fast of Yom Kippur. A failure of the gas lighting plunged a synagogue balcony (apparently, the women's gallery) into darkness, causing panic among the women.[12]\nCrushes on gallery and balcony staircases during the fire delayed the evacuation of the building, a contributing factor in the reported deaths.[13]\n12\n30 May 1883\nUnnamed\nUnited States\nNew York City\nDozens of others injured after a woman tripped on the stairway of the Brooklyn Bridge, which had been open for eight days at the time. The crush was exacerbated by fears the bridge was about to collapse.[14]\nOne rescue worker, two teachers, and 172 children between the ages of five and fifteen were killed. Most of the children were killed in a stairwell when some were trying to escape down the stairs while others, who had found escape impossible that way, were trying to flee up the stairs.\nFollowing a bomb attack during World War I, Parisians tried to enter the Bolivar metro station, but the gates down the stairs only opened to the outside. The first rows of the crowd were crushed or suffocated by those behind them.[17][18]\nA crowd of about 10,000 saying farewell to 750 recruits of the Imperial Japanese Navy collapsed at the bottom of a stairway from a viaduct leading over the tracks down to the platform. The number far exceeded the station's capacity.[19]\nCrowd crush during an attack by the RAF Bomber Command in World War II as they made their way into Galleria delle Grazie, a railway tunnel used as an air-raid shelter. Rushing down the 150 steps leading underground into the shelter, people fell on top of one another.[21]\nPeople were entering the station during an air-raid alert during World War II, and a woman holding a child lost her footing and fell down the stairs, leading to the crowd falling around her in a crush.\nA fire broke out at a performance of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Many died after being trampled by other spectators, with some asphyxiating underneath the piles of people who fell over each other. Most of the dead were found in piles, some three bodies deep, at the most congested exits. A small number of people were found alive at the bottoms of these piles, protected by the bodies on top of them when the burning big top ultimately fell down.\nOccurred when someone shouted \"Fire!\" in the Basilica of St. Teresa. 40 people were arrested in connection with the crush.[22][23][24] Two men who were arrested on the day of the crush were released. The panic started when an elderly devotee brushed against the veil which was holding candles in the head, making a small fire that alarmed those responsible for the panic.[25]\nOccurred two days before the Lunar New Year when many people were returning to their hometowns. About 3,900 people, more than three times the average crowd, flocked to the ticket gate, where 200 tickets were sold for a train with a capacity of 80 people.[28]\nIn the worst disaster in association football history, fans disputing a referee's decision during a match between Peru and Argentina began a pitch invasion and police fired tear gas canisters into one of the grandstands to prevent more fans from invading the field, causing panic so that departing spectators moved down the enclosed stairways, pressing those in the lead against solid corrugated steel shutters at the bottom of tunnels, which were closed. The shutters finally burst outward from pressure of the crush of bodies inside. All deaths occurred in the jammed stairwells, mostly from internal haemorrhaging by crushing pressure, or by asphyxia. An additional 500 people were injured, many critically.[29]\nFans were caught in a crush at the bottom of the stairs leaving through Gate 12 (Puerta 12 in Spanish) of El Monumental Stadium after a derby between River Plate and Boca Juniors. The exact cause for this crush is not certain, though rival fans might have been throwing burning paper, causing a panic. Other accounts say that the gate was closed, either by police or by other fans, intentionally or unintentionally. Still others argue that it was a simple matter of too many fans going through a gate that was narrower than the staircase leading to it. The disaster remains the deadliest sports-related event in Argentine history.\nStairway barriers collapsed after someone fell as fans were leaving the Ibrox Stadium following a match between Rangers and Celtic, leading to a crush. The tragedy included many children who died, and most of the deaths were caused by compressive asphyxia, with bodies being stacked up to six feet deep in the area. More than 200 others were injured.\nWhile some fans were exiting the stadium after a match between Olympiacos and AEK Athens, some lost their balance and fell on the last steps; soon dozens fell onto each other and were stepped over by a horde of unsuspecting fans who kept coming. 19 people died at the scene, while two more died of their wounds in hospital. At least 55 were wounded.\nA crush began at a UEFA Cup match between FC Spartak Moscow and HFC Haarlem at Luzhniki Stadium after a person fell and a dense moving crowd, their direction limited by metal banisters, pushed over the fallen, crushing them. Others stumbled over the bodies in a domino effect creating a large chain-reaction pile-up of people.[32]\nA crush triggered by a wall that collapsed after fans escaping a confrontation between competing fan groups were pressed against it in the stadium before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus. 600 were injured, and the disaster was later described as \"the darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions\".[33]\nAt around 7 a.m., children rushed out of their classrooms at Chengguan Primary School after a bell called all pupils to attend a weekly school assembly on the sports field. One metal door at one end of the building was locked, causing the children from all 18 classes to rush down an unlighted stairwell to the only other exit, and some in the front fell over.[34][35]\nFootball fans at Dasarath Rangasala Stadium attending a Tribhuvan Challenge Shield match between Janakpur Cigarette Factory and Bangladeshi side Liberation Army surged towards the only cover during a hailstorm. The crowd was beaten back by police, but when they returned to the south terrace, a crush developed in a tunnel exit through the terrace and could not escape because the stadium doors were locked, causing a fatal crush at the front of the crowd. 100 more were injured.\nIn one of the world's worst football disasters, 766 people others were injured at Hillsborough Stadium during an FA Cup match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The intensity of the crush broke the barriers on the terraces, while those trapped were packed so tightly in the pens that many victims died of compressive asphyxia while still standing. The 1990 official inquiry concluded that the primary cause was the failure of police control, as too many people were let into the stadium. A 2012 reinvestigation concluded that crowd safety was compromised at every level by lack of police control.\nA blockage at an exit of a pedestrian tunnel (Al-Ma'aisim tunnel) leading out from Mecca towards Mina and the Plains of Arafat led to deaths by suffocation of many religious pilgrims while they were traveling to perform the Stoning of the Devil ritual during the Hajj.\nCrush at a football match between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates attended by about 30,000 fans in a stadium with a capacity for 23,000. When brawls broke out, people panicked, and trying to escape, were crushed against riot-control fences in the melee.\nAn additional 55 religious pilgrims were injured after being overwhelmed by a crowd trying to enter the atrium of the sanctuary church to receive the divine signal from the ashes. The crowd pushed on for access to the atrium, with most of the dead and injured being trampled.[36]\nLarge crowds of unknown size arrived in Yingze Park to see lanterns at a light festival. Crowds moving in opposite directions were crossing a poorly lit bridge. Some fell into the water and were drowned; others were killed in the crowd collapse and crush on the west side of the bridge. In all, 105 people were killed and 108 more were injured.[37][38]\nAt an oversold charity basketball game featuring rap stars, 29 others were injured while entering an overcrowded gymnasium while funneling through a small stairwell area at the City College of New York.[39]\n67 others injured as a crowd of 15,000 to 20,000 revelers celebrated New Year's Eve in the city's nightclub district, controlled by 118 police officers. The victims were mostly teenagers and people in their 20s. The Independent reported witnesses as saying it was impossible to distinguish between the yelps of the partying crowd and the victims' agonized screams.[40][41][42]\nGowari people in a political protest, mostly women and children, perished in a crush triggered by cane-wielding police who attempted to prevent the estimated crowd of 40,000 from pressing towards the Vidan Bhavan. 500 others were injured.\nA fire at a nightclub filled beyond capacity led to a crush at the only exit, whose doors opened inward. Many of the bodies were discovered along the corridor leading to the exit, piled up waist-high.[43]\n147 others were injured on the steep stairway of Estadio Mateo Flores prior to a World Cup qualifying match between Guatemala and Costa Rica. The crowd was estimated at 50,000 in the stadium designed to seat 37,500.\n118\n9 April 1998\nUnnamed\nSaudi Arabia\nMecca\nHajj pilgrims were trampled to death, 180 more injured in an incident on the Jamarat Bridge.[44]\nWhen a landslide caused a cave-in during a Hindu pilgrimage on the day of Makara Jyothi, panic ensued and 200,000 male devotees panicked as the hill upon which they stood collapsed into the temple. The BBC reported that \"Some of the dead were buried in the collapse, but most died in a stampede to avoid the landslide.\"[45]\nA sudden thunderstorm caused a number of young people to race for nearby shelter during an open-air concert. The crowd was funneled toward the underpass of the Nyamiha metro station and many were killed when they started slipping on the wet pavement, falling and trampling each other.\n\"Severe crowd accumulation\" at one exit of Bergisel Stadium went unnoticed. Darkness, a steep slope and a slippery surface were contributing factors, but \"panic did not occur at any time.\" Four others were left in a vegetative state, and 38 were injured.[46]\n425 others injured at the Chamunda Devi temple in a panic caused by a rumor that a bomb was planted in the temple complex.[67] Local authorities, however, blamed steep, slippery slopes leading to the temple.[68]\n7 boys and one girl aged between 11 and 14 years old were killed and 26 injured in result of a crush in Yucai Middle School. 52 evening classes were dismissed at the same time, and the crush occurred when most of the students tried to exit down the same stairwell. It was raining outside, and that particular stairwell was closest to the dormitories.[72]\nCrush occurred during Chhath Puja at the Adalat Ganj area ghat. At least 20 more were also injured, several critically. While it was originally believed that a collapsed bamboo bridge was the cause, later investigations determined that electricity being cut to the ghat was what led to panic.[78][79]\n168 others injured as a result of a nightclub fire. According to local authorities the fire began on stage after members of the band flared a pyrotechnic device that ignited flammable acoustic foam in the ceiling. Other reasons for the high death toll included the lack of emergency exits and the excessive number of people present.[82]\nUp to 24 recruits were killed and more than 119 were injured at several stadiums and other venues across Nigeria when 520,000 applicants were invited to take the aptitude test and physical exercises in order to get one of 4,556 available positions with the Nigerian Immigration Service. As many as one million might have shown up for the event at one of its 37 sites. In many cases, security forces fired their rifles into the air for crowd control, which triggered deadly panics. In at least one location the release of teargas had the same effect. In several locations there was no effective queuing, and all candidates had to enter the stadium through a single door.[91][92]\n40 others injured as a result of a crush at Ibn-e-Qasim Bagh Stadium after a speech of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party chairman, Imran Khan. The latter alleged that only two gates of the venue were opened at the end of the rally and the lights were also switched off, but this was later denied by the DCO and local authorities.[98]\nOccurred during the annual thanksgiving festival of the Oromo people after police confronted protesters during the 2016 Ethiopian protests, resulting in a crush.[112] The opposition political party Oromo Federalist Congress, claimed the number of people confirmed dead was 678. While the government claimed only tear gas and rubber bullets were fired by security forces on the ground as well as from the helicopter, eyewitness as well as some videos allegedly from the scene show security forces firing what seemed to be live rounds of ammunition.\nOccurred near the Rajghat Bridge when many times the expected number of people were heading towards a religious retreat, causing a crush, and later a stampede due to rumors that the bridge had collapsed.[113][114]\n101 more injured in a crush before a concert on the country's 59th Independence Day at the Mahamasina Municipal Stadium. The show was about to start and people believed they could enter the stadium and began to push, but the police left the doors closed.[130]\nAt least 15 killed (11 women) and many more injured in a crowd crush at a stadium, after thousands of people gathered to apply for permits to Pakistan when visa applications resumed after a seven-month pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[140][141]\nDozens more critically wounded in a crush at the annual Meron pilgrimage during Lag BaOmer. Organizers estimated that 100,000 people, the vast majority of whom were Ultra-Orthodox Jews, arrived on the night of 29 April.[142][143]\nCrush at a charity event at Port Harcourt Polo Club organised by Kings Assembly Pentecostal Church. Hundreds of people who had arrived hoping to receive free food and clothing broke through a fence, causing a panic.[148][149]\nCrush at a narrow alley in the Itaewon district during Halloween celebrations; at least 172 more people were injured.[153][154][155] In December 2022, the death of one survivor from suicide was ruled by authorities to have been caused by the disaster, legally declaring him the 159th victim.[156]\nArmed Houthis fired into the air in an attempt at crowd control during a Ramadan charity distribution event and hit an electrical wire, which exploded and caused panic among those waiting. More than 300 others were injured.[161][162]",

He was 82.\nHis daughter Kely Nascimento announced his death Thursday on Instagram.\nPel\u00e9's health had been deteriorating as he aged. Doctors at Albert Einstein Hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo said in late December that he was receiving \"elevated care\" related to \"kidney and cardiac dysfunctions\" stemming from the cancer he had been fighting for more than a year. He also had a respiratory infection, and his family said he would be staying in the hospital over the Christmas holiday.\n\"Inspiration and love marked the journey of King Pel\u00e9, who peacefully passed away today,\" a statement on his organization's website read. \"On his journey, Edson enchanted the world with his genius in sport, stopped a war, carried out social works all over the world and spread what he most believed to be the cure for all our problems: love. His message today becomes a legacy for future generations.\"\nBorn Edson Arantes do Nascimento on Oct. 23, 1940, he was almost exclusively known as Pel\u00e9 \u2014 a nickname he supposedly earned after he mispronounced another footballer's name.\nPel\u00e9 joined the Santos Football Club in Brazil in 1956 at age 15 as an inside forward. The club won the S\u00e3o Paulo league championships and, in 1962 and 1963, both the Libertadores Cup and the Intercontinental Club Cup.\nThe forward, who operated as a second striker, made his international debut just a year after joining Santos, in 1957, and played at the World Cup the following year at age 17 \u2014 the youngest player ever. He picked up a hat trick in the semifinal against France and scored two goals in the championship game against the 1958 tournament host, Sweden.\nAfter bursting onto the world stage and dazzling with his ability to land difficult shots in the net, Brazil declared that Pel\u00e9 was a \"national treasure,\" a move to prevent him from being scooped up by wealthier European teams. Instead, Santos went on an international tour to give fans a chance to see the star.\nPel\u00e9 tore a muscle at the next World Cup tournament in 1962 and had to sit out after the second match, but the Brazilian national team prevailed and picked up back-to-back titles. Brazil lost in the first round at the next World Cup, in 1966, after Pel\u00e9 and others suffered injuries.\nHe considered retiring from international play, but made a triumphant return in 1970 to win it all once again. Pel\u00e9 closed out his World Cup career netting 12 goals in 14 games and remains the only soccer player to win the trophy three times.\nPel\u00e9 retired from Santos in 1974 after scoring a mind-boggling 643 goals in 659 games.\nHe was coaxed out of retirement a year later to join his second-ever team, the New York Cosmos. At 34, he signed a three-year $7 million deal to play for the U.S. team, which The New York Times reported at the time made him the highest-paid team athlete in the world. He ended up playing for the Cosmos for two years, helping them win the North American Soccer League trophy, and he was widely credited with increasing popularity in the sport in the U.S.\nHis last-ever game was an exhibition match between Santos and the Cosmos. He played the first half with the Cosmos and the second half with his beloved Santos. When the time expired, his teammates lifted the emotional Pel\u00e9 onto their shoulders and paraded him around the field.\n\"In simple terms, Pel\u00e9 made soccer cool,\" Shep Messing, a goalkeeper for the Cosmos, told ESPN 40 years after that last game. \"Mick Jagger, Elton John, Robert Redford at the games. Muhammad Ali, he was there on the field for that final game, and at that time, the two most recognizable people on the planet were the two of them.\"\nPel\u00e9 scored more than 1,000 goals in the course of his career, earning a Guinness World Record.\nHe used his platform after soccer to support charitable works and try to improve the lives of Brazil's poor. He became a UNESCO global ambassador in 1994 and served as a minister for sport in Brazil. He also published several autobiographies that went on to become bestsellers and starred in documentary films about his life.\nHe and Argentine star Diego Maradona, who was younger than Pel\u00e9 and played after his retirement, have often been discussed as the greatest players of all time \u2014 even being jointly named the \"player of the century\" by FIFA in 2000. Despite the competition, the two struck up a friendship before Maradona died in 2020 after years of trading jabs.\n\"I want to thank Pel\u00e9. We know who he is and who he will always be. We need icons like him,\" Maradona said at a friendly exhibition match in 2016.\nFIFA ultimately named Pel\u00e9 the \"greatest of all time\" in 2012 and the International Olympic Committee named him the \"athlete of the century\" in 1999.\nAfter his death was announced Thursday, tributes from the soccer world poured in.\nSantos tweeted out a reference to his nickname, \"O Rei\" or \"The King.\"\nPortuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo praised \"The King\" on social media as well.\n\"A mere 'goodbye' to the eternal King Pel\u00e9 will never be enough to express the pain that the entire football world is currently embracing,\" Ronaldo said. \"An inspiration to so many millions, a reference yesterday, today and forever. The love you always showed me was reciprocated in every moment we shared even from distance. He will never be forgotten and his memory will live forever in each and every one of us football lovers.\"\nFrance forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who scored a hat trick in the most recent World Cup final earlier this month in Qatar, said Pel\u00e9's \"legacy will never be forgotten.\"\nAnd former English footballer Geoff Hurst said, \"I have so many memories of Pele, without doubt the best footballer I ever played against. ... For me Pele remains the greatest of all time and I was proud to be on the the pitch with him. RIP Pele.\"",

R. R. Tolkien upon whose books those films were based. With the two sides \"on better terms\", they began offering the rights to a potential television series based on Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to several outlets, including Amazon, Netflix, and HBO,[21] with a starting price of US$200 million.[2] HBO pitched a remake of the Lord of the Rings films which Tolkien's estate was not interested in, and Netflix pitched multiple connected series focusing on characters such as Aragorn and Gandalf which reportedly \"completely freaked out the estate\". Amazon did not pitch a specific story but promised to work closely with the Tolkien Estate so they could \"protect Tolkien's legacy\", which they were unable to do with previous adaptations.[22] Amazon emerged as the frontrunner by September 2017 and entered negotiations.[23][24] Uncommonly for programming developments at the studio, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was personally involved with the negotiations.[24] Bezos was a personal fan of The Lord of the Rings,[2] and had previously given Amazon Studios a mandate to develop an ambitious fantasy series of comparable scale to HBO's Game of Thrones.[21]\nOn November 13, 2017, Amazon acquired the global television rights for close to US$250 million. Industry commentators described this amount\u2014before any production costs and without any creative talent attached to the project\u2014as \"insane\",[21] although some considered the project to be more of a reputational risk for Amazon than a financial one due to Bezos's wealth.[2] Amazon's streaming service Amazon Prime Video gave a multi-season commitment to the series that was believed to be for five seasons, with the possibility of a spin-off series as well. Despite this, Prime Video had to give a formal greenlight to future seasons before work could begin on them.[25] The budget was expected to be in the range of US$100\u2013150 million per season, and was likely to eventually exceed US$1 billion which would make it the most expensive television series ever made.[21][23]Warner Bros. Television was not involved in the project because Amazon Studios wanted to produce it themselves. Amazon was working with the Tolkien Estate, the Tolkien Trust, HarperCollins, and New Line Cinema (the Warner Bros. division who produced the films).[21] New Line was reportedly included to allow the use of material from the films.[23] The Tolkien Estate imposed creative restrictions on the series,[21][26] and the deal stipulated that production begin within two years.[23]\nThe first season was reported to focus on a young Aragorn in May 2018.[27] Jennifer Salke, the head of Amazon Studios, said a month later that the deal for the series had only just been officially completed.[28] The studio met more than 30 potential writers,[29] including the Russo brothers and Anthony McCarten,[22] and asked for story pitches based on anything in Tolkien's The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and its appendices. These included prequel stories focused on characters such as Aragorn, Gimli, and Gandalf.[30][31]J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay pitched a series that explored the major events of Middle-earth's Second Age, thousands of years before The Lord of the Rings, including the forging of the Rings of Power, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the fall of the island kingdom of N\u00famenor, and the last alliance between Elves and Men.[7] These events were covered in a five-minute prologue in the Lord of the Rings films,[32] and the pair wanted to expand this into \"50 hours of television\".[2] In contrast with the other experienced writers being interviewed, Payne and McKay had only done unproduced or uncredited writing. They were championed to Amazon by director J. J. Abrams who worked with them on an unproduced Star Trek film,[2][22] and were hired to develop the series in July 2018.[33] Payne said their pitch felt like \"an amazing, untold story\" that was \"worthy of Tolkien\",[30] and McKay added, \"We didn't want to do a side thing. A spinoff or the origin story of something else. We wanted to find a huge Tolkienian mega epic, and Amazon\" agreed.[34]\nJackson said in December 2018 that he and his film producing partners would read some scripts for the series and offer notes on them, but he later stated that this did not happen. Amazon explained that the deal to acquire the television rights for The Lord of the Rings required them to keep the series distinct from Jackson's films, and the Tolkien Estate were reportedly against Jackson's involvement in the project.[35] Payne and McKay were confirmed as showrunners and executive producers in July 2019, when the project's full creative team was revealed.[36][37] Additional executive producers include Lindsey Weber, Callum Greene, J. A. Bayona, Bel\u00e9n Atienza, Justin Doble, Jason Cahill, Gennifer Hutchison, Bruce Richmond, and Sharon Tal Yguado.[36][37][38] Prime Video officially ordered a second season in November 2019,[25] and announced the series' full title, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, in January 2022. Payne and McKay felt the title could \"live on the spine of a book next to J.R.R. Tolkien's other classics\".[1]\nThe Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are set during the Third Age, while the First and Second Ages are explored in other Tolkien writings such as The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, and The History of Middle-earth. Because Amazon only bought the television rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the writers had to identify all of the references to the Second Age in those books and create a story that bridged those passages. These are primarily in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, but also in certain chapters and songs.[7] Tolkien's estate was prepared to veto any changes from his established narrative,[26] including anything that contradicted what Tolkien wrote in other works.[7] The writers were free to add characters or details,[26] and worked with the estate and Tolkien lore experts to ensure these were still \"Tolkienian\".[7] They referenced letters that Tolkien wrote about his works and mythology for additional context on the setting and characters.[7][39]Simon Tolkien, a novelist and the grandson of J.R.R. Tolkien, consulted on the series and helped develop its story and character arcs. He is credited as a \"series consultant\".[40] The showrunners disagreed with suggestions that the series was only \"vaguely connected\" to Tolkien's writings. McKay said they felt it was \"deeply, deeply connected\" and a \"story we're stewarding that was here before us and was waiting in those books\" to be told.[41] A disclaimer is featured in the series' end credits stating that some elements are \"inspired by, though not contained in, the original source material\".[42]\nPayne and McKay knew the series was expected to run for five seasons and were able to plan elements of the final season, including the series' final shot, while working on the first.[43] Because they were unable to adapt dialogue from Tolkien's Second Age stories, the writers attempted to repurpose dialogue that they did have access to while also taking inspiration from religious texts and poetry. They tailored the dialogue to different characters using dialects and poetic meters.[7] Leith McPherson returned from the Hobbit films as dialect coach and noted that Tolkien's fictional languages evolve over time, so they are different for the Second Age compared to the Third. The series' Elves mostly speak Quenya, a language described as \"Elvish Latin\" that is often just used for spellcasting in the Third Age.[44]Dwarvish and Orkish are also heard, along with English, Scottish, and Irish dialects.[44][45] The biggest deviation made from Tolkien's works, which was approved by the estate and lore experts, was to condense the Second Age from thousands of years to a short period of time. This avoided human characters frequently dying due to their relatively short lifespans and allowed major characters from later in the timeline to be introduced earlier in the series.[2] The showrunners considered using non-linear storytelling instead, but felt this would prevent the audience from emotionally investing in the series. They said many real-life historical dramas also condense events like this, and felt they were still respecting the \"spirit and feeling\" of Tolkien's writings.[46]\nAfter the series was revealed to have hired Jennifer Ward-Lealand as an intimacy coordinator, Tolkien fans expressed concern that it would include Game of Thrones-style graphic sex and violence.[47] Payne and McKay said this would not be the case and the series would be family-friendly. They hoped to evoke the tone of Tolkien's books, which can be \"intense, sometimes quite political, sometimes quite sophisticated\u2014but it's also heartwarming and life-affirming and optimistic.\"[2] They also said they did not want to be influenced by modern politics, aspiring to tell a timeless story that matched Tolkien's own intention to create a mythology that would always be applicable.[46]\nIllustrator and concept artist John Howe said in August 2019 that the series would remain faithful to the designs of the film trilogies.[57] Payne and McKay later clarified that the series is not a direct continuation of the films,[7] per Amazon's deal for the series,[35] but they did not want it to \"clash\" with the films and tried to have similar designs. They took advantage of Howe's experience working on Jackson's adaptations, as well as that of costume designer Kate Hawley who worked on the Hobbit films. Other influences included the 1977 animated television adaptation of The Hobbit by Rankin/Bass.[7] Howe had filled 40 sketchbooks with drawings for the project by May 2022.[58]\nRick Heinrichs was initially announced as production designer,[37] and helped \"launch\" the series' designs before departing the project.[59] He was replaced by Ramsey Avery,[2][60] who said his biggest challenge was making Middle-earth feel both familiar and new. He approached this by attempting to create a \"vibrant and rich and golden\" world that contrasted with the films in which \"everything is on its decline, and it's fading\".[60] Avery left the series after the first season to work on the film Captain America: Brave New World (2024),[61] and was replaced by Kristian Milsted for the season season.[62]\nIn June 2018, Salke said the series could be produced in New Zealand, where the film trilogies were made, but Amazon was also willing to shoot in other countries as long as they could \"provide those locations in a really authentic way, because we want it to look incredible\".[48] Amazon confirmed in September 2019 that filming for the first season would take place in New Zealand.[63]Scotland had also been considered as a location.[64][65] Filming for the season began in Auckland in February 2020,[49][66] with J. A. Bayona directing the first two episodes.[67] Production was placed on hold in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[68] and this shutdown segued into an already planned production break that allowed footage from the first two episodes to be reviewed and writing on the second season to begin.[69] Filming resumed at the end of September.[70]Wayne Che Yip and Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m directed the rest of the season's episodes.[71][72] Around a third of filming took place on location around New Zealand.[73] Production for the first season officially wrapped on August 2, 2021.[74]\nThe week after filming ended for the first season, Amazon announced that it was moving production of the series to the United Kingdom starting with the second season. Factors that played a role in the change included Amazon already heavily investing in UK studio space for other productions as well as New Zealand's restrictive pandemic-era border policies.[75] The Tolkien Estate also wanted the series to be filmed in the UK since Tolkien was inspired by locations there when writing his books.[76] Pre-production for the second season was expected to begin in the UK in the second quarter of 2022,[77] taking place concurrently with post-production for the first season which was continuing in New Zealand until June 2022.[75] Filming on the second season began on October 3,[78] with Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, Sanaa Hamri, and Louise Hooper directing.[3] Filming took place primarily at Bray Film Studios and Bovingdon Airfield outside of London,[77] with location filming around the UK and in the Canary Islands.[79][80] Production for the season wrapped in June 2023,[61] amid the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.[81]\nCompany 3 created a post-production environment in the cloud that all work and assets for the series went through, allowing producer Ron Ames to manage all of post-production remotely. This became a necessity during the pandemic, and helped give the production a head-start on the second season when it moved to the UK.[82] The primary visual effects vendors for the first season were W\u0113t\u0101 FX, returning from Jackson's films, and Industrial Light & Magic.[83] All the vendors were overseen by visual effects supervisor Jason Smith.[84] The season's effects include characters appearing at different scales,[84] augmented environments,[85] creatures,[86] and magic.[87]\nThe opening title sequence was co-directed by Katrina Crawford and Mark Bashore of the creative studio Plains of Yonder. They did not see any material from the series when starting work and instead took inspiration from Tolkien.[88] Based on the author's creation story in which the world is created from music, the pair suggested the title sequence be \"built from the world of sound\".[89] They investigated the science of cymatics, using a homemade Chladni plate and slow motion iPhone footage to test what shapes could be formed with sand particles by the vibrations of different sounds (including Gregorian chants, Angelic music, rock and roll, and whale calls).[88][90] For the final sequences, Crawford and Bashore used a 2 feet (0.61 m) wide rig and programmed tones to create basic patterns such as diamonds and swirls which were filmed practically.[89][90] The Plains of Yonder visual effects team then attempted to replicate the \"flawed, wild motion\" of the real photography for shots that feature iconography from Tolkien's writings such as the Two Trees of Valinor, the eight-pointed star associated with the character F\u00ebanor, the geography of Middle-earth, and each set of the Rings of Power (nine human rings, seven Dwarven rings, three Elven rings, and the One Ring).[88][89][91] The sequence took seven months to complete.[88]\nHoward Shore, the composer for the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, was reported to be in discussions with Amazon about working on the series in September 2020. He was said to be interested in developing musical themes but not necessarily composing the entire score.[92] Shore was confirmed to be in talks for the series a year later,[93] when composer Bear McCreary was reported to be involved as well.[92] Their hiring was officially announced in July 2022, with McCreary composing the score and Shore writing the main title theme.[94] McCreary was contractually prohibited from quoting any themes that Shore wrote for the films.[95]\nMcCreary said the series was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to work on such an ambitious score, and he hoped to create a \"continuity of concept\" between the series and Shore's work on the films. He wrote more than 15 new themes for the series.[96] Though Shore's main theme was composed independently of McCreary's work, McCreary felt it \"fit together so beautifully\" with his own music.[97] A soundtrack album featuring Shore's main theme and selections from McCreary's score for the first season was released on August 19, 2022.[98] Additional albums featuring McCreary's full score for each episode were also released.[99]\nEarly promotions for the series on social media used several maps of Middle-earth's Second Age, as well as excerpts from the novel The Lord of the Rings.[26][100] The maps were designed and created by illustrator John Howe and overseen by Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey to ensure they were accurate to Tolkien's works.[100] Howe and Shippey spent a lot of time working on the maps, which were based on Christopher Tolkien's maps of N\u00famenor during the Second Age as well as his maps of the Third Age. Despite their efforts, HarperCollins received complaints from fans shortly after the maps were released online regarding two mistakes that were made on them.[57]\nAmazon considered the reveal of the series' full title in January 2022 to be crucial due to it beginning the series' marketing campaign at the start of its premiere year. Instead of just using visual effects to create the title reveal, the studio released an announcement video in which the letters of the title are physically cast from molten metal while an excerpt of the \"Ring Verse\" from The Lord of the Rings is read in voiceover. The video was directed by Klaus Obermeyer, who worked with special effects supervisor Lee Nelson under advisement by veteran special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull.[101] They filmed the video with foundryman Landon Ryan in late 2021 in Los Angeles, after experimenting with different combinations of metals, as well as sparkler dust, argon pours, and liquid hydrogen, to create the desired look. The final metal was a mixture of bronze and aluminum which was poured into moulds of compressed sand that could be used multiple times. The pouring was filmed at 5,000 frames per second with a Phantom Flex4K camera so it could be shown in ultra-slow motion.[102] For the final title card, the forged letters were inscribed with Elvish writing and placed on a large piece of redwood. Staff from the Tolkien fan website TheOneRing.net and entertainment journalists were invited by Amazon to watch the filming of the video.[101][102] Prologue Films provided previsualization for the sequence as well as compositing and additional visual effects. They recreated the final title card digitally, taking care to maintain the \"integrity of the live action shots and lighting\".[103]\nA new book chronicling the events of Middle-earth's Second Age was announced in June 2022. Titled The Fall of N\u00famenor, it was compiled and edited by Tolkien scholar Brian Sibley from J.R.R. and Christopher Tolkien's writings about the Second Age. The book was published in November 2022 following the release of The Rings of Power's first season, to capitalize on new interest in Tolkien's works arising from the series' release.[104]\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power premiered on Prime Video in the United States on September 1, 2022.[105] Episodes were released in more than 240 countries and territories at the same time as the U.S.[105][106]\nAmazon announced that The Rings of Power had been watched by 25 million viewers globally in the first 24 hours that the first two episodes were available on Prime Video, the service's biggest premiere ever. This was the first time Amazon had publicly stated viewership data for Prime Video and the company did not specify how much of an episode a user needed to watch for them to count as a viewer.[107] By December 2022 the series had been watched by more than 100 million viewers globally and was Prime Video's most watched series ever. Sanders called it \"a tremendous success\".[108] In April 2023, Kim Masters at The Hollywood Reporter reported that the season was only finished by 37 percent of its initial U.S. viewers and 45 percent of international viewers. Salke responded that attempts to paint the series as less than a success did not reflect Amazon's internal discussions.[109]\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 83% approval score for the first season based on 489 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It may not yet be the One Show to Rule Them All, but The Rings of Power enchants with its opulent presentation and deeply-felt rendering of Middle-earth.\"[110]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[111]",

R. R. Tolkien upon whose books those films were based. With the two sides \"on better terms\", they began offering the rights to a potential television series based on Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to several outlets, including Amazon, Netflix, and HBO,[21] with a starting price of US$200 million.[2] HBO pitched a remake of the Lord of the Rings films which Tolkien's estate was not interested in, and Netflix pitched multiple connected series focusing on characters such as Aragorn and Gandalf which reportedly \"completely freaked out the estate\". Amazon did not pitch a specific story but promised to work closely with the Tolkien Estate so they could \"protect Tolkien's legacy\", which they were unable to do with previous adaptations.[22] Amazon emerged as the frontrunner by September 2017 and entered negotiations.[23][24] Uncommonly for programming developments at the studio, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was personally involved with the negotiations.[24] Bezos was a personal fan of The Lord of the Rings,[2] and had previously given Amazon Studios a mandate to develop an ambitious fantasy series of comparable scale to HBO's Game of Thrones.[21]\nOn November 13, 2017, Amazon acquired the global television rights for close to US$250 million. Industry commentators described this amount\u2014before any production costs and without any creative talent attached to the project\u2014as \"insane\",[21] although some considered the project to be more of a reputational risk for Amazon than a financial one due to Bezos's wealth.[2] Amazon's streaming service Amazon Prime Video gave a multi-season commitment to the series that was believed to be for five seasons, with the possibility of a spin-off series as well. Despite this, Prime Video had to give a formal greenlight to future seasons before work could begin on them.[25] The budget was expected to be in the range of US$100\u2013150 million per season, and was likely to eventually exceed US$1 billion which would make it the most expensive television series ever made.[21][23]Warner Bros. Television was not involved in the project because Amazon Studios wanted to produce it themselves. Amazon was working with the Tolkien Estate, the Tolkien Trust, HarperCollins, and New Line Cinema (the Warner Bros. division who produced the films).[21] New Line was reportedly included to allow the use of material from the films.[23] The Tolkien Estate imposed creative restrictions on the series,[21][26] and the deal stipulated that production begin within two years.[23]\nThe first season was reported to focus on a young Aragorn in May 2018.[27] Jennifer Salke, the head of Amazon Studios, said a month later that the deal for the series had only just been officially completed.[28] The studio met more than 30 potential writers,[29] including the Russo brothers and Anthony McCarten,[22] and asked for story pitches based on anything in Tolkien's The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and its appendices. These included prequel stories focused on characters such as Aragorn, Gimli, and Gandalf.[30][31]J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay pitched a series that explored the major events of Middle-earth's Second Age, thousands of years before The Lord of the Rings, including the forging of the Rings of Power, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the fall of the island kingdom of N\u00famenor, and the last alliance between Elves and Men.[7] These events were covered in a five-minute prologue in the Lord of the Rings films,[32] and the pair wanted to expand this into \"50 hours of television\".[2] In contrast with the other experienced writers being interviewed, Payne and McKay had only done unproduced or uncredited writing. They were championed to Amazon by director J. J. Abrams who worked with them on an unproduced Star Trek film,[2][22] and were hired to develop the series in July 2018.[33] Payne said their pitch felt like \"an amazing, untold story\" that was \"worthy of Tolkien\",[30] and McKay added, \"We didn't want to do a side thing. A spinoff or the origin story of something else. We wanted to find a huge Tolkienian mega epic, and Amazon\" agreed.[34]\nJackson said in December 2018 that he and his film producing partners would read some scripts for the series and offer notes on them, but he later stated that this did not happen. Amazon explained that the deal to acquire the television rights for The Lord of the Rings required them to keep the series distinct from Jackson's films, and the Tolkien Estate were reportedly against Jackson's involvement in the project.[35] Payne and McKay were confirmed as showrunners and executive producers in July 2019, when the project's full creative team was revealed.[36][37] Additional executive producers include Lindsey Weber, Callum Greene, J. A. Bayona, Bel\u00e9n Atienza, Justin Doble, Jason Cahill, Gennifer Hutchison, Bruce Richmond, and Sharon Tal Yguado.[36][37][38] Prime Video officially ordered a second season in November 2019,[25] and announced the series' full title, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, in January 2022. Payne and McKay felt the title could \"live on the spine of a book next to J.R.R. Tolkien's other classics\".[1]\nThe Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are set during the Third Age, while the First and Second Ages are explored in other Tolkien writings such as The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, and The History of Middle-earth. Because Amazon only bought the television rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the writers had to identify all of the references to the Second Age in those books and create a story that bridged those passages. These are primarily in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, but also in certain chapters and songs.[7] Tolkien's estate was prepared to veto any changes from his established narrative,[26] including anything that contradicted what Tolkien wrote in other works.[7] The writers were free to add characters or details,[26] and worked with the estate and Tolkien lore experts to ensure these were still \"Tolkienian\".[7] They referenced letters that Tolkien wrote about his works and mythology for additional context on the setting and characters.[7][39]Simon Tolkien, a novelist and the grandson of J.R.R. Tolkien, consulted on the series and helped develop its story and character arcs. He is credited as a \"series consultant\".[40] The showrunners disagreed with suggestions that the series was only \"vaguely connected\" to Tolkien's writings. McKay said they felt it was \"deeply, deeply connected\" and a \"story we're stewarding that was here before us and was waiting in those books\" to be told.[41] A disclaimer is featured in the series' end credits stating that some elements are \"inspired by, though not contained in, the original source material\".[42]\nPayne and McKay knew the series was expected to run for five seasons and were able to plan elements of the final season, including the series' final shot, while working on the first.[43] Because they were unable to adapt dialogue from Tolkien's Second Age stories, the writers attempted to repurpose dialogue that they did have access to while also taking inspiration from religious texts and poetry. They tailored the dialogue to different characters using dialects and poetic meters.[7] Leith McPherson returned from the Hobbit films as dialect coach and noted that Tolkien's fictional languages evolve over time, so they are different for the Second Age compared to the Third. The series' Elves mostly speak Quenya, a language described as \"Elvish Latin\" that is often just used for spellcasting in the Third Age.[44]Dwarvish and Orkish are also heard, along with English, Scottish, and Irish dialects.[44][45] The biggest deviation made from Tolkien's works, which was approved by the estate and lore experts, was to condense the Second Age from thousands of years to a short period of time. This avoided human characters frequently dying due to their relatively short lifespans and allowed major characters from later in the timeline to be introduced earlier in the series.[2] The showrunners considered using non-linear storytelling instead, but felt this would prevent the audience from emotionally investing in the series. They said many real-life historical dramas also condense events like this, and felt they were still respecting the \"spirit and feeling\" of Tolkien's writings.[46]\nAfter the series was revealed to have hired Jennifer Ward-Lealand as an intimacy coordinator, Tolkien fans expressed concern that it would include Game of Thrones-style graphic sex and violence.[47] Payne and McKay said this would not be the case and the series would be family-friendly. They hoped to evoke the tone of Tolkien's books, which can be \"intense, sometimes quite political, sometimes quite sophisticated\u2014but it's also heartwarming and life-affirming and optimistic.\"[2] They also said they did not want to be influenced by modern politics, aspiring to tell a timeless story that matched Tolkien's own intention to create a mythology that would always be applicable.[46]\nIllustrator and concept artist John Howe said in August 2019 that the series would remain faithful to the designs of the film trilogies.[57] Payne and McKay later clarified that the series is not a direct continuation of the films,[7] per Amazon's deal for the series,[35] but they did not want it to \"clash\" with the films and tried to have similar designs. They took advantage of Howe's experience working on Jackson's adaptations, as well as that of costume designer Kate Hawley who worked on the Hobbit films. Other influences included the 1977 animated television adaptation of The Hobbit by Rankin/Bass.[7] Howe had filled 40 sketchbooks with drawings for the project by May 2022.[58]\nRick Heinrichs was initially announced as production designer,[37] and helped \"launch\" the series' designs before departing the project.[59] He was replaced by Ramsey Avery,[2][60] who said his biggest challenge was making Middle-earth feel both familiar and new. He approached this by attempting to create a \"vibrant and rich and golden\" world that contrasted with the films in which \"everything is on its decline, and it's fading\".[60] Avery left the series after the first season to work on the film Captain America: Brave New World (2024),[61] and was replaced by Kristian Milsted for the season season.[62]\nIn June 2018, Salke said the series could be produced in New Zealand, where the film trilogies were made, but Amazon was also willing to shoot in other countries as long as they could \"provide those locations in a really authentic way, because we want it to look incredible\".[48] Amazon confirmed in September 2019 that filming for the first season would take place in New Zealand.[63]Scotland had also been considered as a location.[64][65] Filming for the season began in Auckland in February 2020,[49][66] with J. A. Bayona directing the first two episodes.[67] Production was placed on hold in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[68] and this shutdown segued into an already planned production break that allowed footage from the first two episodes to be reviewed and writing on the second season to begin.[69] Filming resumed at the end of September.[70]Wayne Che Yip and Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m directed the rest of the season's episodes.[71][72] Around a third of filming took place on location around New Zealand.[73] Production for the first season officially wrapped on August 2, 2021.[74]\nThe week after filming ended for the first season, Amazon announced that it was moving production of the series to the United Kingdom starting with the second season. Factors that played a role in the change included Amazon already heavily investing in UK studio space for other productions as well as New Zealand's restrictive pandemic-era border policies.[75] The Tolkien Estate also wanted the series to be filmed in the UK since Tolkien was inspired by locations there when writing his books.[76] Pre-production for the second season was expected to begin in the UK in the second quarter of 2022,[77] taking place concurrently with post-production for the first season which was continuing in New Zealand until June 2022.[75] Filming on the second season began on October 3,[78] with Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, Sanaa Hamri, and Louise Hooper directing.[3] Filming took place primarily at Bray Film Studios and Bovingdon Airfield outside of London,[77] with location filming around the UK and in the Canary Islands.[79][80] Production for the season wrapped in June 2023,[61] amid the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.[81]\nCompany 3 created a post-production environment in the cloud that all work and assets for the series went through, allowing producer Ron Ames to manage all of post-production remotely. This became a necessity during the pandemic, and helped give the production a head-start on the second season when it moved to the UK.[82] The primary visual effects vendors for the first season were W\u0113t\u0101 FX, returning from Jackson's films, and Industrial Light & Magic.[83] All the vendors were overseen by visual effects supervisor Jason Smith.[84] The season's effects include characters appearing at different scales,[84] augmented environments,[85] creatures,[86] and magic.[87]\nThe opening title sequence was co-directed by Katrina Crawford and Mark Bashore of the creative studio Plains of Yonder. They did not see any material from the series when starting work and instead took inspiration from Tolkien.[88] Based on the author's creation story in which the world is created from music, the pair suggested the title sequence be \"built from the world of sound\".[89] They investigated the science of cymatics, using a homemade Chladni plate and slow motion iPhone footage to test what shapes could be formed with sand particles by the vibrations of different sounds (including Gregorian chants, Angelic music, rock and roll, and whale calls).[88][90] For the final sequences, Crawford and Bashore used a 2 feet (0.61 m) wide rig and programmed tones to create basic patterns such as diamonds and swirls which were filmed practically.[89][90] The Plains of Yonder visual effects team then attempted to replicate the \"flawed, wild motion\" of the real photography for shots that feature iconography from Tolkien's writings such as the Two Trees of Valinor, the eight-pointed star associated with the character F\u00ebanor, the geography of Middle-earth, and each set of the Rings of Power (nine human rings, seven Dwarven rings, three Elven rings, and the One Ring).[88][89][91] The sequence took seven months to complete.[88]\nHoward Shore, the composer for the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, was reported to be in discussions with Amazon about working on the series in September 2020. He was said to be interested in developing musical themes but not necessarily composing the entire score.[92] Shore was confirmed to be in talks for the series a year later,[93] when composer Bear McCreary was reported to be involved as well.[92] Their hiring was officially announced in July 2022, with McCreary composing the score and Shore writing the main title theme.[94] McCreary was contractually prohibited from quoting any themes that Shore wrote for the films.[95]\nMcCreary said the series was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to work on such an ambitious score, and he hoped to create a \"continuity of concept\" between the series and Shore's work on the films. He wrote more than 15 new themes for the series.[96] Though Shore's main theme was composed independently of McCreary's work, McCreary felt it \"fit together so beautifully\" with his own music.[97] A soundtrack album featuring Shore's main theme and selections from McCreary's score for the first season was released on August 19, 2022.[98] Additional albums featuring McCreary's full score for each episode were also released.[99]\nEarly promotions for the series on social media used several maps of Middle-earth's Second Age, as well as excerpts from the novel The Lord of the Rings.[26][100] The maps were designed and created by illustrator John Howe and overseen by Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey to ensure they were accurate to Tolkien's works.[100] Howe and Shippey spent a lot of time working on the maps, which were based on Christopher Tolkien's maps of N\u00famenor during the Second Age as well as his maps of the Third Age. Despite their efforts, HarperCollins received complaints from fans shortly after the maps were released online regarding two mistakes that were made on them.[57]\nAmazon considered the reveal of the series' full title in January 2022 to be crucial due to it beginning the series' marketing campaign at the start of its premiere year. Instead of just using visual effects to create the title reveal, the studio released an announcement video in which the letters of the title are physically cast from molten metal while an excerpt of the \"Ring Verse\" from The Lord of the Rings is read in voiceover. The video was directed by Klaus Obermeyer, who worked with special effects supervisor Lee Nelson under advisement by veteran special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull.[101] They filmed the video with foundryman Landon Ryan in late 2021 in Los Angeles, after experimenting with different combinations of metals, as well as sparkler dust, argon pours, and liquid hydrogen, to create the desired look. The final metal was a mixture of bronze and aluminum which was poured into moulds of compressed sand that could be used multiple times. The pouring was filmed at 5,000 frames per second with a Phantom Flex4K camera so it could be shown in ultra-slow motion.[102] For the final title card, the forged letters were inscribed with Elvish writing and placed on a large piece of redwood. Staff from the Tolkien fan website TheOneRing.net and entertainment journalists were invited by Amazon to watch the filming of the video.[101][102] Prologue Films provided previsualization for the sequence as well as compositing and additional visual effects. They recreated the final title card digitally, taking care to maintain the \"integrity of the live action shots and lighting\".[103]\nA new book chronicling the events of Middle-earth's Second Age was announced in June 2022. Titled The Fall of N\u00famenor, it was compiled and edited by Tolkien scholar Brian Sibley from J.R.R. and Christopher Tolkien's writings about the Second Age. The book was published in November 2022 following the release of The Rings of Power's first season, to capitalize on new interest in Tolkien's works arising from the series' release.[104]\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power premiered on Prime Video in the United States on September 1, 2022.[105] Episodes were released in more than 240 countries and territories at the same time as the U.S.[105][106]\nAmazon announced that The Rings of Power had been watched by 25 million viewers globally in the first 24 hours that the first two episodes were available on Prime Video, the service's biggest premiere ever. This was the first time Amazon had publicly stated viewership data for Prime Video and the company did not specify how much of an episode a user needed to watch for them to count as a viewer.[107] By December 2022 the series had been watched by more than 100 million viewers globally and was Prime Video's most watched series ever. Sanders called it \"a tremendous success\".[108] In April 2023, Kim Masters at The Hollywood Reporter reported that the season was only finished by 37 percent of its initial U.S. viewers and 45 percent of international viewers. Salke responded that attempts to paint the series as less than a success did not reflect Amazon's internal discussions.[109]\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 83% approval score for the first season based on 489 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It may not yet be the One Show to Rule Them All, but The Rings of Power enchants with its opulent presentation and deeply-felt rendering of Middle-earth.\"[110]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[111]",

The second is when there is a delay between the detection of the outbreak and widespread recognition and declaration of it as an international concern.[4] The declaration is promulgated by an emergency committee (EC) made up of international experts operating under the IHR (2005),[3] which was developed following the SARS outbreak of 2002\u20132003.[4] Between 2009 and 2016, there were four PHEIC declarations.[14] The fifth was the 2018\u20132020 Kivu Ebola epidemic, declared in July 2019 and ended in June 2020.[6] The sixth was the COVID-19 pandemic, declared in January 2020 and ended in May 2023.[15] The seventh was the 2022\u20132023 mpox outbreak, declared in July 2022 and ended in May 2023.[8] Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.[2]\nan extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.[16]\nThis definition designates a public health crisis of potentially global reach and implies a situation that is \"serious, sudden, unusual, or unexpected\", which may necessitate immediate international action.[16][17]\nIt can be seen as an \"alarm system\", a \"call to action\" and \"last resort\" measure.[12][13]\nWHO Member States have 24 hours within which to report potential PHEIC events to the WHO.[9] It does not have to be a member state that reports a potential outbreak, hence reports to the WHO may also be received informally, by non-governmental sources.[18][19]\nUnder the IHR (2005), ways to detect, evaluate, notify, and report events were ascertained by all countries in order to avoid PHEICs. The response to public health risks also was decided.[12]\nThe IHR decision algorithm assists WHO Member States in deciding whether a potential PHEIC exists and whether the WHO should be notified. The WHO should be notified if any two of the four following questions are affirmed:[9]\nIs the public health impact of the event serious?\nIs the event unusual or unexpected?\nIs there a significant risk for international spread?\nIs there a significant risk for international travel or trade restrictions?\nA declaration of a PHEIC may appear as an economic burden to the state facing the epidemic. Incentives to declare an epidemic are lacking and the PHEIC may be seen as placing limitations on trade in countries that already are struggling.[12]\nIn order to declare a PHEIC, the WHO Director-General is required to take into account factors that include the risk to human health and international spread as well as advice from an international committee of experts, the IHR Emergency Committee (EC), one of whom should be an expert nominated by the State within whose region the event arises.[1] Rather than being a standing committee, the EC is created on an ad hoc basis.[21]\nUntil 2011, the names of IHR EC members were not publicly disclosed; in the wake of reforms, now they are. These members are selected according to the disease in question and the nature of the event. Names are taken from the IHR Experts Roster. The director-general takes the advice of the EC, following their technical assessment of the crisis using legal criteria and a predetermined algorithm after a review of all available data on the event. Upon declaration, the EC then makes recommendations on what actions the director-general and member states should take to address the crisis.[21] The recommendations are temporary and require review every three months while in place.[1]\nIn the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged. It was detected first in Mexico, North America. It spread quickly across the United States and the world.[22] On 26 April 2009,[23] more than one month after its first emergence,[4] the initial PHEIC was declared when the H1N1 (or swine flu) pandemic was still in phase three.[24][25][26] Within three hours on the same day, the WHO web site received almost two million visits, necessitating a dedicated web site for the swine influenza pandemic.[23] At the time that H1N1 had been declared a PHEIC, it had occurred in only three countries.[4] Therefore, it was argued that the declaration of the H1N1 outbreak as a PHEIC, was fueling public fear.[20] A 2013 study sponsored by the WHO estimated that, although similar in magnitude to seasonal influenza, it cost more life-years than seasonal flu, due to a shift toward mortality among persons less than 65 years of age.[27]\nThe second PHEIC was the 2014 polio declaration, issued on 5 May 2014 with a rise in cases of wild polio and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus.[10] The status achieved, as global eradication, was deemed to be at risk by air travel and border crossing overland, with small numbers of cases in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.[20][10]\nIn October 2019, continuing cases of wild polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan, in addition to new vaccine-derived cases in Africa and Asia, was reviewed and polio continued to be a PHEIC.[28] As of November 2021, taking into account recent events in Afghanistan, a large number of unvaccinated children, increasing mobile people in Pakistan and the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among others, polio remains a PHEIC.[29]\nConfirmed cases of Ebola were being reported in Guinea and Liberia in March 2014 and Sierra Leone by May 2014. On Friday, 8 August 2014, following the occurrence of Ebola in the United States and Europe and with the already intense transmission ongoing in three other countries for months,[12] the WHO declared its third PHEIC in response to the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa.[30] Later, one review showed that a direct impact of this epidemic on America escalated a PHEIC declaration.[4] It was the first PHEIC in a resource-poor setting.[12]\nOn 1 February 2016, the WHO declared its fourth PHEIC in response to clusters of microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome in the Americas, which at the time were suspected to be associated with the ongoing 2015\u20132016 Zika virus epidemic.[31] Later research and evidence bore out these concerns; in April, the WHO stated that \"there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\"[32] This was the first time a PHEIC was declared for a mosquito\u2010borne disease.[20] This declaration was lifted on 18 November 2016.[33]\nIn October 2018 and then later in April 2019, the WHO did not consider the 2018\u20132020 Kivu Ebola epidemic to be a PHEIC.[34][35] The decision was controversial, with Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) responding with disappointment and describing the situation as \"an Ebola gas can sitting in DRC that's just waiting for a match to hit it\",[36] while the WHO panel were unanimous in their decision that declaring it a PHEIC would not give any added benefit.[36] The advice against declaring a PHEIC in October 2018 and April 2019, despite the criteria for doing so appearing to be met on both occasions, has led to the transparency of the IHR EC coming into question. The language used in the statements for the Kivu Ebola epidemic has been noted to be different. In October 2018, the EC stated \"a PHEIC should not be declared at this time\". In the 13 previously declined proposals for declaring a PHEIC, the resultant statements quoted \"the conditions for a PHEIC are not currently met\" and \"does not constitute a PHEIC\". In April 2019, they stated that \"there is no added benefit to declaring a PHEIC at this stage\", a notion that is not part of the PHEIC criteria laid down in the IHR.[21][37]\nAfter confirmed cases of Ebola in neighbouring Uganda in June 2019, Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the WHO, announced that the third meeting of a group of experts would be held on 14 June 2019 to assess whether the Ebola spread had become a PHEIC.[38][39] The conclusion was that while the outbreak was a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the region, it did not meet all the three criteria for a PHEIC.[40] Despite the number of deaths reaching 1,405 by 11 June 2019 and 1,440 by 17 June 2019, the reason for not declaring a PHEIC was that the overall risk of international spread was deemed to be low, and the risk of damaging the economy of the DRC high.[41] Adhanom also stated that declaring a PHEIC would be an inappropriate way to raise money for the epidemic.[42] Following a visit to the DRC in July 2019, Rory Stewart, the UK's DfID minister, called for the WHO to declare it an emergency.[43]\nAcknowledging a high risk of spread to the capital of North Kivu, Goma, a call for a PHEIC declaration was published on 10 July 2019 in The Washington Post by Daniel Lucey and Ron Klain (the former United States Ebola response coordinator). Their declaration stated that \"in the absence of a trajectory toward extinguishing the outbreak, the opposite path\u2014severe escalation\u2014remains possible. The risk of the disease moving into nearby Goma, Congo\u2014a city of 1 million residents with an international airport\u2014or crossing into the massive refugee camps in South Sudan is mounting. With a limited number of vaccine doses remaining, either would be a catastrophe\".[44][45] Four days later, on 14 July 2019, a case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, which has an international airport and a highly mobile population. Subsequently, the WHO announced a reconvening of a fourth EC meeting on 17 July 2019, when they officially announced it \"a regional emergency, and by no means a global threat\" and declared it as a PHEIC, without restrictions on trade or travel.[46][47] In response to the declaration, the president of the DRC, together with an expert committee led by a virologist, took responsibility for directly supervising action, while in protest of the declaration, health minister, Oly Ilunga Kalenga resigned.[48] A review of the PHEIC had been planned at a fifth meeting of the EC on 10 October 2019 [49] and on 18 October 2019 it remained a PHEIC[6] until 26 June 2020 when it was decided that the situation no longer constituted a PHEIC, as the outbreak was considered over.[50]\nOn the date of the declaration, there were 7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five of the six WHO regions.[53][54] Previously, the WHO had held EC meetings on 22 and 23 January 2020 regarding the outbreak,[55][56][57] but it was determined at that time that it was too early to declare a PHEIC, given the lack of necessary data and the then-scale of global impact.[58][59]\nThe WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[60] The emergency committee convened its third meeting on 30 April 2020,[61] fourth on 31 July,[62] fifth on 29 October,[63] sixth on 14 January 2021,[64] seventh on 15 April 2021,[65] ninth in October 2021,[66] tenth in January 2022,[67] eleventh in April 2022,[68] twelfth in July 2022,[69] thirteenth in October 2022,[7] fourteenth in January 2023,[70] and fifteenth in May 2023.[52]\nIn September 2022, the Lancet commission on COVID-19 published a report, calling the response to the pandemic \"a massive global failure on multiple levels\".[71][72] The WHO responded by noting \"several key omissions and misinterpretations in the report, not least regarding the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and the speed and scope of WHO's actions.\"[71][73] They stated that the report \"offers the best opportunity to insist that the failures and lessons from the past 3 years are not wasted but are constructively used to build more resilient health systems and stronger political systems that support the health and wellbeing of people and planet during the 21st century.\"[71]\nThe formal end of the COVID-19 PHEIC is a matter of much nuance which carries its own risks, and as of March 2023, \"WHO member states are negotiating amendments to the International Health Regulations as well as a new legally binding agreement (most likely a treaty) on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. Proposals include the possibility of issuing intermediate public health alerts (short of PHEICs) and determining public health emergencies of regional concern. Notably, although COVID-19 is routinely referred to as a pandemic, this word is not used in the International Health Regulations.\"[74] With the emergency phase of the pandemic being regarded as having ended, more subtle and robust institutional responses and protocols are in the works for further iterations of this pandemic as well as global pandemics of whatever etiology.[75]\nAt the second IHR meeting for the 2022\u20132023 mpox outbreak on 21 July 2022, members of the emergency committee were divided about issuing a PHEIC, with six in favor and nine against.[76] On 23 July 2022, the WHO director-general declared the outbreak a PHEIC.[77] On 11 May 2023, the WHO ended the PHEIC declaration for Mpox, six days after doing so for COVID-19.[78]\nOn the date of the declaration, there were 17,186 cases reported globally, affecting 75 countries in all six WHO regions, with five deaths reported outside Africa and 72 deaths in African countries.[79] The WHO had previously held an EC meeting on 23 June 2022 regarding the outbreak, which had more than 2,100 cases in over 42 countries at that point; it did not reach the criteria for a PHEIC alert at the time.[80]\nIn 2018, an examination of the first four declarations (2009\u20132016) showed that the WHO was noted to be more effective in responding to international health emergencies, and that the international system in dealing with these emergencies was \"robust\".[5]\nAnother review of the first four declarations, with the exception of wild polio, demonstrated that responses were varied. Severe outbreaks, or those that threatened larger numbers of people, did not receive a swift PHEIC declaration, and the study hypothesized that responses were quicker when American citizens were infected and when the emergencies did not coincide with holidays.[4]\nPHEIC was not invoked with the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2013.[82][83] Originating in Saudi Arabia, MERS reached more than 24 countries and resulted in more than 580 deaths by 2015, although most cases were in hospital settings rather than sustained community spread. As a result, what constitutes a PHEIC has been unclear.[11][84] As of May 2020, there had been 876 deaths.[84][85]",

        "context": "\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the company's largest shareholder. He became CEO in 2008. Tesla's announced mission is to create products which help \"accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\"\nThe company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2008. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck light-duty pickup truck in 2023.[7] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[8] Tesla's 2022 deliveries were around 1.31 million vehicles, a 40% increase over the previous year,[9][10] and cumulative sales totaled 4 million cars as of April 2023.[11] In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization temporarily reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, product defects, and Musk's many controversial statements.\nThe company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[12][13] Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively.[14] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[15]\nIan Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[12] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2022) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2022) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[16][17][14]J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[18]\nA lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five \u2013 Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel \u2013 to call themselves co-founders.[19]\nElon Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[20] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[21]\nIn February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[22][17] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[23] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[23]\nTesla's first car, the Roadster, was officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in Santa Monica, California, at a 350-person invitation-only event held in Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.[24]\nIn August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[25] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[26] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[27] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[27] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[28]\nTesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[29][30] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[31]\nIn May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, from Toyota for $42 million,[35] and opened the facility in October 2010 to start production of the Model S.[36] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[37] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[38]\nIn January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[39] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[40] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[41] The Model S was also the bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[42]\nTesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[43]\nTesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[44] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[45]\nTesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[46][47]\nTesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[48] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[49] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[50] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[51]\nTesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. Compared to Tesla's previous luxury vehicles, the Model 3 was less expensive and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[52] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3. Instead, the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles,[53] leading to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company would later come to describe as \"production hell.\"[54][55] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 would become the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[56][57]\nThis period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[58][59] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain CEO.\nFrom July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[60] Tesla was added to the index on December 21, 2020.[61] It was the most valuable company ever added, already the sixth-largest member.[61] During 2020, the share price increased 740%,[62] and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached $848 billion,[63] more than the next nine largest automakers combined and becoming the US' 5th most valuable company.[64][65] In July 2020, Tesla reached a valuation of $206 billion, surpassing Toyota to become the world's most valuable automaker.[66] On August 31, 2020, Tesla completed a 5-for-1 stock split.[67]\nDuring this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[71] The first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[72]Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[73] and production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[74]Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[75] and production of the Model Y began in April 2022.[76] Tesla has also announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[77]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the entire automotive industry, and Tesla was no exception. Government officials in China closed Gigafactory Shanghai and lawmakers in California shut down production at the Tesla Fremont Factory. While China allowed Tesla to resume production a few weeks later, California did not. Tesla would ultimately defy state orders, and restart production on May 11, 2020.[78]\nAfter the dispute with California officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[79][80] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[81] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[82]\nTesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[83] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[84] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[85] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[86] In July 2022 it was reported that Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[87]\nThe Model S is a full-size luxury car with a liftback body style and a dual motor, all-wheel drive layout. Development of the Model S began prior to 2007 and deliveries started in June 2012. The Model S has seen two major design refreshes, first in April 2016 which introduced a new front-end design and again in June 2021 which revised the interior. The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016. Since its introduction, more than 250,000 vehicles have been sold.\nThe Model X is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV offered in 5-, 6- and 7-passenger configurations with either a dual- or tri-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The rear passenger doors open vertically with an articulating \"falcon-wing\" design. A prototype Model X was first shown in February 2012 and deliveries started in September 2015.[88] The Model X shares around 30 percent of its content with the Model S. The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in June 2021 which revised the interior.\nThe Model 3 is a mid-size car with a fastback body style and either a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout or a rear-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model S sedan. A prototype Model 3 was first shown in 2016 and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[52] Deliveries started in July 2017.[89] The Model 3 ranked as the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021,[90][91][92] and cumulative sales passed 1 million in June 2021.[8] The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in September 2023 which revised the exterior and interior.\nThe Model Y is a mid-size crossover SUV offered in 5- and 7-passenger configurations with a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model X SUV. A prototype Model Y was first shown in March 2019,[68] and deliveries started in March 2020.[70] The Model Y shared around 75 percent of its content with the Model 3.[69] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling car, the first ever electric vehicle to claim the title.[93]\nThe Tesla Semi Class 8semi-truck by Tesla, Inc. with a tri-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[94] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[95] As of July 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production,[3] and Tesla does not expect the truck to enter volume production before 2024, due to limited availability of the required 4680 battery cells.[96]\nThe Cybertruck is a pickup truck unveiled on November 21, 2019.[97] The truck's novel design made of flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel and bulletproof glass windows earned a mixed reception.[98][99][100] As of February 2023, Musk has stated that deliveries are planned to begin by the end of Q3 2023.[101]\nOn November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0\u201360 miles per hour (0\u201397 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0\u2013100 mph (0\u2013161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[102] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[103] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[103] The base price was set at $200,000.[103] Musk has said that the Roadster should ship in 2024.[104]\nThe original Tesla Roadster[106] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[107] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge.\nTesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[108]\nTesla service strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center, or a mobile technician is dispatched.[109][110] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[111]\nIn 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[112]\nSupercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers.\nTesla Supercharger station (V3) with ten charging posts\nThe Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California, Nevada and Arizona. As of September 2023[update], Tesla operates a network of 5,500 Supercharger stations with 50,000 connectors. The stations are primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,000), North America (over 2,000) and Europe (over 1,000). Superchargers supply electrical power at 72 kilowatts (kW), 100 kW, 150 kW or 250 kW, with the maximum amount increasing over the years as the company improves its technology.\n\"Destination Charger\" in North America\nTesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners setup the devices and set pricing.[113] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[114] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[115]\nThe company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[118] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[119] As of 2023, insurance was available in 12 states.[120]\nAs of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia. The company also offers insurance for Tesla vehicle owners with non-Tesla vehicles.[118]\nTesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[121] In 2022, the company deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 348 megawatts, an increase of 3 megawatts over 2021, and deployed 6.5 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 64% over 2021.[122]\nFor large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[126][127][128] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[129] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[130][131]\nAt the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[132] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[21][133] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The most recent models, the Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[134][135] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[136]\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[137][138] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[139][140] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[141][142] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[143] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[138] instead of near other auto dealerships.[144][145][146]\nAnalysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151]\nTesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154]\nTesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148]\nTesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visibleComparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors\nTesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries.\nTesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[158]\nBusiness analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[159]\nTesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[160] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[161]\nThe next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[161]\nFor vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[162] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[163] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product.\nFor vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[161]\nTesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[164][165] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[161]\nTesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[161] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO 4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[166] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[167] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[168]\nTesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[169][170][171][172] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[173] \u2013 and sold in 2021.[174] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[175][176] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[177][178]\nTesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[179] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[180]\nThe system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[181] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[182]\nTesla makes two kinds of electric motors. Its oldest design in production is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor[183] (which inspired the Tesla logo). These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\nNewer, higher efficiency permanent magnet motors have been in use since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017. They are currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[184] The permanent magnet motors are more efficient, especially in stop-start driving.[185]\nThe North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186]\nSince September 2014, all Tesla cars are shipped with sensors (initially hardware version 1 or \"HW1\") and software to support Autopilot.[188] Tesla upgraded its sensors and software in October 2016 (\"HW2\") to support full self-driving in the future.[189] HW2 includes eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar.[189] HW2.5 was released in mid-2017, and it upgraded HW2 with a second graphics processing unit (GPU) and, for the Model 3 only, a driver-facing camera.[190] HW3 was released in early 2019 with an updated and more powerful computer, employing a custom Tesla-designed system on a chip.[191]\nIn April 2019, Tesla announced that all of its cars will include Autopilot software (defined as just Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer (Beta)) as a standard feature moving forward.[192] Full self-driving software (Autopark, Navigate on Autopilot (Beta), Auto Lane Change (Beta), Summon (Beta), Smart Summon (Beta) and future abilities) is an extra cost option.[192]\nIn 2020, Tesla released software updates where its cars recognize and automatically stop at stop signs and traffic lights.[193][194][195] In May 2021, Tesla removed the radar sensor and radar features from its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, opting instead to rely on camera vision alone.[196][197][198] The New York Times reported in December 2021 that Musk \"repeatedly told members of the Autopilot team that humans could drive with only two eyes and that this meant cars should be able to drive with cameras alone,\" an analogy some experts and former Tesla engineers described as \"deeply flawed.\"[199] Similarly, a statistical analysis conducted in A Methodology for Normalizing Safety Statistics of Partially Automated Vehicles debunked a common Tesla claim that Autopilot reduced crash rates by 40 percent[200] by accounting for the relative safety of the given operating domain when using active safety measures.[201]\nFull Self-Driving (FSD) is an optional extension of Autopilot promoted as eventually being able to perform fully autonomous driving. At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017,[202] which as of July 2022[update] has not occurred.[203] The first beta version of the software was released on October 22, 2020, to a small group of testers.[204] The release of the beta has renewed concern regarding whether the technology is ready for testing on public roads.[205][206] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has called for \"tougher requirements\" for any testing of Autopilot on public roads.[207]\nTesla's approach to achieve full autonomy is different from that of other companies.[208] Whereas Waymo, Cruise, and other companies are relying on highly detailed (centimeter-scale) three-dimensional maps, lidar, and cameras, as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors in their autonomous vehicles, Tesla's approach is to use coarse-grained two-dimensional maps and cameras (no lidar) as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors.[208][209] Tesla claims that although its approach is much more difficult, it will ultimately be more useful, because its vehicles will be able to self-drive without geofencing concerns.[210] Tesla's self-driving software has been trained on over 20 billion miles driven by Tesla vehicles as of January 2021.[211] Tesla also designed a self-driving computer chip that has been installed in its cars since March 2019.[212]\nMost experts believe that Tesla's approach of trying to achieve full self-driving by eschewing lidar and high-definition maps is not feasible.[213][214][215] In March 2021, according to a letter that Tesla sent to the California Department of Motor Vehicles about FSD's capability \u2013 acquired by PlainSite via a public records request \u2013 Tesla stated that FSD is not capable of autonomous driving and is only at Society of Automotive Engineers Level 2 automation.[216] In a May 2021 study by Guidehouse Insights, Tesla was ranked last for both strategy and execution in the autonomous driving sector.[217] In October 2021, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called on Tesla to change the design of its Autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to Musk.[218]\nAhead of the start of production of the Model 3, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble vehicles. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[219] Grohmann Automation,[220] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[221] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[53]\nTesla uses massive casting machines (Giga Press) to make large single pieces of vehicle underbodies and to streamline production.[222] This saves time, labor, cost and factory space, replacing multiple robots that weld car parts together with a single machine.[223]\nIn September 2022, Tesla revealed prototypes of a humanoid robot named Optimus, which Musk has stated uses the same core software as FSD. During the presentations at Tesla's AI Day 2022, Musk suggested that, among other use cases, the finalized version of Optimus could be used in Tesla's car factories to help with repetitive tasks and relieve labor shortages.[224]\nIn July 2023, Tesla acquired Wiferion, a Germany-based developer of wireless charging systems for industrial vehicles and autonomous robots, which has since been operating as Tesla Engineering Germany GmbH.[225] Tesla sold the business to Munich-based Puls Group three months later, but retained its staff.[226][227]\nIn November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[228]\nThe company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2023[update], the company also operates more than 1,000 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3]\nTesla was founded in San Carlos, California.[244] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[245] Tesla's first retail store was opened in 2008 in Los Angeles.[246]\nTesla's first assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[247] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[35]\nTesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces Powerwalls, Powerpacks and Megapacks;[231] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic;[248] and Model 3 drivetrains.[249] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years.[250]\nAs part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[251][252] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[234] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[253]\nOn July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[254] Giga Texas is planned to be the main factory for the Tesla Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi; it will also produce Model 3 and Model Y cars for the Eastern United States.[255][242] On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of the facility in a public event.[76]\nOn December 1, 2021, Tesla relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto, California, to the Gigafactory site in Austin, Texas.[256]\nTesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[257][258] The location opened in 2022.\nTesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters.\nTesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[259] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[260] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[261]\nIn late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[262] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[263]\nTesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[264] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[265] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[266] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[267][268] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[268]\nTesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[270]\nIn July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[271] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[236] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[272]\nTesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[273] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[274]\nIn January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[275] The partnership was part of Panasonic's $1 billion investment over three years in facilities for lithium-ion cell research, development and production.[276]\nBeginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[277] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[278]\nTesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[234] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[279][280]\nIn March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[281]\nDaimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[287][288] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[289] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[290] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[291]\nTesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[292][293] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[294][295] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[296] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N\u22c5m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[297] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[298][299]\nIn May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[35]\nIn July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[300] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[301][302] based on components from the Roadster.[303]\nThe production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[304] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[305][306]\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[307] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[307][158] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[308][309]\nInitial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[310] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[311]\nIn 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[312] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[313]\nWomen feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[314] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[315] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[314] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[316]\nIn May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[317]\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[324] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[325]\nIn January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[326][327][328] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[329][330] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[331] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[332] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[333]\nIn September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[334][335]\nThe California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[339]\nThere have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[340]Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[341] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[342] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[343] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[344][345] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[346]\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[347] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[348]\nA consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[349] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[350] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[351][352] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[353]\nIn August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[354] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[355][356][357] Musk settled fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[358] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[358] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[359][360] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[361]\nIn September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[362] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[362] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[363][364]\nUnlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[141] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[144] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[365][366][367]\nTesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[368] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[141] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[144] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[111]\nIn January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[369] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[370] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[371]\nTesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[372] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[373] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[374]\nIn 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[360] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[375]\nIn July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[376]\nIn 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[377] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[378] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[379] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[380]\nIn June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[381] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[382][326] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[383][384]\nIn August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[385] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[386]\nIn May 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, awarding each of the 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit 136,000 Norwegian kroner ($16,000).[387]\nTesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[388][389] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[390] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[391] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[392] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[393] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[394] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[395] and physically demanding work.[396] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[397]\nIn July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[398]\nIn October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015\u20132016.[399][400] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[401][402] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[403] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[404] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[405]\nFew of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[406] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.\nTesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[407] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[408] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[409][410][78] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[411][412] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[413] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[414]\nIn May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[415] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[416] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[417] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[407][418]\nIn China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work \u2013 but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[419] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[419] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.\u2013Chinese relations, China's ongoing persecution of Uyghurs, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[419]\nTesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[420][421]\nA Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[422]\nTSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[423] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[424] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[425]Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[426]\nAccording to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[427]\nIn 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[428][429][430]\nMusk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[431][432] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[433] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[434] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[435] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[436] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[437] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[438]\nOn April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[439][440] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[441]\nIn October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[442] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015\u20132017 Model S and 2016\u20132017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[443][444]\nIn February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[445] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[446][447] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[448]\nAlso in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[449][450]\nIn June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[451]\nOn December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[452] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[453]\nIn September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[454][455] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[455]\nIn February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[456] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[457] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[458]\nTesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[459] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[460] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[461] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[462] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[463] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[464][465][466]\nA Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[467][468] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[469] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[470]\nAccording to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[471][472] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[473] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[473][474][475] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[476] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[477] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[478]\nA safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[479] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[480] Several Tesla fans responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[481]\nIn August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[482] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[483] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[484]\nIn September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[485] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[486] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[487]\nIn January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[488][489] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[490]\nIn June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[491]\nIn February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[492] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[493]\nIn May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[494] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[495]Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[496]\nTesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[497]\nIn 2022, Tesla ranked as the world's bestselling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 18%.[498] Tesla reported 2022 vehicle deliveries of 1,313,851 units, up 40% from 2021.[9][10] In March 2023, Tesla produced its 4 millionth car.[499]\nTesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[500] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[501] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[502]\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[10] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[10]\nOf the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[10]\nTesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[141]: 31\nIn February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[83] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[503][504] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[505][506]\nThe quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[507]\nTesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[514] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[515] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[516] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[517] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[515] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[515] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[518]Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[519] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[520] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[521]\nAnother criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[522] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[523]\n^ abBurns, Matt (October 8, 2014). \"A Brief History of Tesla\".

        "context": "\nIn the late 1990s, Microsoft began developing a managed code runtime and programming language (C#) which it billed together as part of the \".NET platform\", with the core runtime and software libraries comprising the .NET Framework.\nAt the heart of the .NET Platform is the .NET Framework, a high-productivity, multilanguage development and execution environment for building and running Web services with important features such as cross-language inheritance and debugging.[5]\nOn November 12, 2014, Microsoft introduced .NET Core\u2014an open-source, cross-platform[6] successor[7] to .NET Framework\u2014and released source code for the .NET Core CoreCLR implementation, source for the \"entire [...] library stack\" for .NET Core,[8] and announced the adoption of a conventional (\"bazaar\"-like) open-source development model under the stewardship of the .NET Foundation. Miguel de Icaza describes .NET Core as a \"redesigned version of .NET that is based on the simplified version of the class libraries\",[9] and Microsoft's Immo Landwerth explained that .NET Core would be \"the foundation of all future .NET platforms\". At the time of the announcement, the initial release of the .NET Core project had been seeded with a subset of the libraries' source code and coincided with the relicensing of Microsoft's existing .NET reference source away from the restrictions of the Ms-RSL. Landwerth acknowledged the disadvantages of the formerly selected shared license, explaining that it made codename Rotor \"a non-starter\" as a community-developed open source project because it did not meet the criteria of an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license.[10][11][12]\n.NET Core 1.0 was released on June 27, 2016,[13] along with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, which enables .NET Core development.[14] .NET Core 1.0.4 and .NET Core 1.1.1 were released along with .NET Core Tools 1.0 and Visual Studio 2017 on March 7, 2017.[15]\n.NET Core 2.0 was released on August 14, 2017, along with Visual Studio 2017 15.3, ASP.NET Core 2.0, and Entity Framework Core 2.0.[16] .NET Core 2.1 was released on May 30, 2018.[17] NET Core 2.2 was released on December 4, 2018.[18]\n.NET Core 3 was released on September 23, 2019.[19] .NET Core 3 adds support for Windows desktop application development[20] and significant performance improvements throughout the base library.\nIn November 2020, Microsoft released .NET 5.0.[21] The \"Core\" branding was abandoned and version 4.0 was skipped to avoid conflation with .NET Framework, of which the latest releases had all used 4.x versioning for all significant (non-bugfix) releases since 2010.\nIt addresses the patent concerns related to the .NET Framework[citation needed].\nIn November 2021, Microsoft released .NET 6.0,[22] and in November 2022 released .NET 7.0,[23] but only the former is a long-term support (LTS) release.\n.NET fully supports C# and F# (and C++/CLI as of 3.1; only enabled on Windows) and supports Visual Basic .NET (for version 15.5 in .NET Core 5.0.100-preview.4, and some old versions supported in old .NET Core).[39]\nVB.NET compiles and runs on .NET, but as of .NET Core 3.1, the separate Visual Basic Runtime is not implemented. Microsoft initially announced that .NET Core 3 would include the Visual Basic Runtime, but after two years the timeline for such support was updated to .NET 5.[40][41]\nAs an implementation of CLI's Standard Libraries,[49] CoreFX shares a subset of .NET Framework APIs, however, it also comes with its own APIs that are not part of the .NET Framework.[42] A variant of the .NET library is used for UWP.[50]\nThe official community mascot of .NET is the .NET Bot (stylized as \"dotnet bot\" or \"dotnet-bot\"). The dotnet bot served as the placeholder developer for the initial check-in of the .NET source code when it was open-sourced.[53] It has since been used as the official mascot.",

        "context": "\nBut when Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO in 2008, Putin warned that their membership would be a threat to Russia.[17] Some NATO members worried about antagonizing Russia.[18] At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia membership, but Jaap de Hoop Scheffer also issued a statement that they would join one day.[19] Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would do everything it could to prevent this.[20] Putin claimed that NATO members had promised in 1990 not to let Eastern European countries join. That statement is disputed.[21]\nIn March and April 2021, Russia built up its forces near the Russia\u2013Ukraine border,[38] and again in both Russia and Belarus between October 2021 and February 2022.[39] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine.[40][41] The decision to invade Ukraine was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in Putin's inner circle, including national security adviser Nikolai Patrushev and defense ministerSergei Shoigu.[42]\nDuring the second build-up, Russia demanded that NATO end all activity in Eastern Europe and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO.[43] Russia threatened an unspecified military response if NATO followed an \"aggressive line.\"[44] These demands were widely seen as non-viable; Eastern European states have willingly joined NATO for security reasons, and their governments sought protection from Russian irredentism.[45] A treaty to prevent Ukraine joining would go against NATO's \"open door\" policy, despite NATO's unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join.[46] NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that \"Russia has no say\" on whether Ukraine joins, and that \"Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors.\"[47] NATO's official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, and NATO and Russia had co-operated until Russia annexed Crimea.[48] NATO offered to improve communication with Russia to discuss missile placements and military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's borders,[49] but Russia did not do so.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both made efforts in February 2022 to prevent war.[50] Macron met Putin but failed to dissuade him from the invasion. Scholz warned Putin of heavy sanctions would be imposed should he invade, and told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to declare Ukraine a neutral state and renounce its aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted to uphold such a settlement.[51]\nOn 21 February, Putin announced Russian diplomatic recognition of the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states: the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The following day, Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as \"peacekeepers\",[52] and the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad.[53]\nPutin's address to the nation on 24 February 2022. Minutes after Putin's announcement, the invasion began.\nBefore 5 a.m. Kyiv time on February 24, Putin in another speech announced, a \"special military operation\", which \"effectively declar[ed] war on Ukraine.\"[54][55] Putin said the operation was to \"protect the people\" of the Russian-controlled breakaway republics. He falsely claimed that they had \"been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime.\"[56] Putin also falsely claimed that Ukrainian government officials were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[57] He said Russia sought the \"demilitarisation and denazification\" of Ukraine, and espoused views challenging Ukraine's right to exist.[58][59] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[57] Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[60] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east, and south.[61] Russia did not officially declare war.[62] Reports of an alleged leak of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[63]\nThe invasion, described as the biggest attack on a European country since the Second World War, began at dawn on 24 February.[54][64] Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air campaign, commencing air and missile strikes across Ukraine,[65][66] with some rockets reaching as far west as Lviv.[67] It is Russia's largest combined arms operation since the Battle of Berlin in 1945.[68] Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time near Milove on the border with Russia.[69] The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a southeastern front from Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy.[70] Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white Z military symbol (a non-Cyrillic letter), believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.[71]\nOn the southern front, Russian forces had captured the regional capital of Kherson by 2 March. A column of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles was ambushed on 9 March in Brovary and sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat.[79] The Russian army adopted siege tactics on the western front around the key cities of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, but failed to capture them due to stiff resistance and logistical setbacks.[80] In Mykolaiv Oblast, Russian forces advanced as far as Voznesensk, but were repelled and pushed back south of Mykolaiv. On 25 March, the Russian Defence Ministry stated that the first stage of the \"military operation\" in Ukraine was \"generally complete\", that the Ukrainian military forces had suffered serious losses, and the Russian military would now concentrate on the \"liberation of Donbas.\"[81] The \"first stage\" of the invasion was conducted on four fronts, including one towards western Kyiv from Belarus by the Russian Eastern Military District, comprising the 29th, 35th, and 36th Combined Arms Armies. A second axis, deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the Central Military District (northeastern front), comprised the 41st Combined Arms Army and the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army.[82]\nA third axis was deployed towards Kharkiv by the Western Military District (eastern front), with the 1st Guards Tank Army and 20th Combined Arms Army. A fourth, southern front originating in occupied Crimea and Russia's Rostov oblast with an eastern axis towards Odesa and a western area of operations toward Mariupol was opened by the Southern Military District, including the 58th, 49th, and 8th Combined Arms Army, the latter also commanding the 1st and 2nd Army Corps of the Russian separatist forces in Donbas.[82] By 7 April, Russian troops deployed to the northern front by the Russian Eastern Military District pulled back from the Kyiv offensive, reportedly to resupply and redeploy to the Donbas region in an effort to reinforce the renewed invasion of southeastern Ukraine. The northeastern front, including the Central Military District, was similarly withdrawn for resupply and redeployment to southeastern Ukraine.[82][83] On 26 April, delegates from the US and 40 allied nations met at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss the formation of a coalition that would provide economic support in addition to military supplies and refitting to Ukraine.[84] Following Putin's Victory Day speech in early May, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said no short term resolution to the invasion should be expected.[85]\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy with members of the Ukrainian Army on 18 June 2022\nUkraine's reliance on Western-supplied equipment constrained operational effectiveness, as supplying countries feared that Ukraine would use Western-made mat\u00e9riel to strike targets in Russia.[86] Military experts disagreed on the future of the conflict; some suggested that Ukraine should trade territory for peace,[87] while others believed that Ukraine could maintain its resistance thanks to Russian losses.[88]\nBy 30 May, disparities between Russian and Ukrainian artillery were apparent, with Ukrainian artillery being vastly outgunned, in terms of both range and number.[86] In response to US PresidentJoe Biden's indication that enhanced artillery would be provided to Ukraine, Putin said that Russia would expand its invasion front to include new cities in Ukraine. In apparent retribution, Putin ordered a missile strike against Kyiv on 6 June after not directly attacking the city for several weeks.[89] On 10 June 2022, deputy head of the SBU Vadym Skibitsky stated that during the Severodonetsk campaign, the frontlines were where the future of the invasion would be decided: \"This is an artillery war now, and we are losing in terms of artillery. Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us. Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.\"[90] On 29 June, Reuters reported that US Intelligence Director Avril Haines, in an update of past U.S. intelligence assessments on the Russian invasion, said that U.S. intelligence agencies agree that the invasion will continue \"for an extended period of time ... In short, the picture remains pretty grim and Russia's attitude toward the West is hardening.\"[91] On 5 July, BBC reported that extensive destruction by the Russian invasion would cause immense financial damage to Ukraine's reconstruction economy, with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal telling nations at a reconstruction conference in Switzerland that Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost.[92]\nThe invasion began on 24 February, launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv, and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv. The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads, from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk.\nRussian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River. The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and from the east at Sumy. These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the north-east and east.[66][65]\nRussia tried to seize Kyiv quickly, with Spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north, but failed.[93][94] The United States contacted Zelenskyy and offered to help him flee the country, lest the Russian Army attempt to kidnap or kill him on seizing Kyiv; Zelenskyy responded that \"The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.\"[95]The Washington Post, which described the quote as \"one of the most-cited lines of the Russian invasion\", was not entirely sure of the comment's accuracy. Reporter Glenn Kessler said it came from \"a single source, but on the surface it appears to be a good one.\"[96] Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus gained control of the ghost town of Chernobyl.[97]Russian Airborne Forces attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv, launching an airborne assault on Antonov Airport,[98] and a similar landing at Vasylkiv, near Vasylkiv Air Base, on 26 February.[99]\nBy early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences.[66][65] As of 5 March, a large Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) long, had made little progress toward Kyiv.[100] The London-based think tankRoyal United Services Institute (RUSI) assessed Russian advances from the north and east as \"stalled.\"[101] Advances from Chernihiv largely halted as a siege began there. Russian forces continued to advance on Kyiv from the northwest, capturing Bucha, Hostomel, and Vorzel by 5 March,[102][103] though Irpin remained contested as of 9 March.[104] By 11 March, the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed and taken cover.[105] On 16 March, Ukrainian forces began a counter-offensive to repel Russian forces.[106] Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv, Russian forces switched their strategy to indiscriminate bombing and siege warfare.[107][108]\nOn 25 March, a Ukrainian counter-offensive retook several towns to the east and west of Kyiv, including Makariv.[109][110] Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north at the end of March. Ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 April.[111] Ukraine said it had recaptured the entire region around Kyiv, including Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel, and uncovered evidence of war crimes in Bucha.[112] On 6 April, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that the Russian \"retraction, resupply, and redeployment\" of their troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin's plans for Ukraine, by redeploying and concentrating his forces on eastern Ukraine.[83] Kyiv was generally left free from attack apart from isolated missile strikes. One did occur while UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres was visiting Kyiv on 28 April to discuss the survivors of the siege of Mariupol with Zelenskyy. One person was killed and several were injured in the attack.[113]\nOn 4 March, Frederick Kagan wrote that the Sumy axis was then \"the most successful and dangerous Russian avenue of advance on Kyiv\", and commented that the geography favoured mechanised advances as the terrain \"is flat and sparsely populated, offering few good defensive positions.\"[65] Travelling along highways, Russian forces reached Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on 4 March.[66][65]The Pentagon confirmed on 6 April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast, but Sumy Oblast remained contested.[118] On 7 April, the governor of Sumy Oblast said that Russian troops were gone, but had left behind rigged explosives and other hazards.[119]\nAfter renewed missile attacks on 14 March in Mariupol, the Ukrainian government said more than 2,500 had died.[135] By 18 March, Mariupol was completely encircled and fighting reached the city centre, hampering efforts to evacuate civilians.[136] On 20 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people, was destroyed by Russian bombs.[137] The Russians demanded surrender, and the Ukrainians refused.[70][138] On 27 March, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said that \"(m)ore than 85 percent of the whole town is destroyed.\"[139]\nPutin told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on 29 March that the bombardment of Mariupol would only end when the Ukrainians surrendered.[140] On 1 April, Russian troops refused safe passage into Mariupol to 50 buses sent by the United Nations to evacuate civilians, as peace talks continued in Istanbul.[141] On 3 April, following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Russia expanded its attack on southern Ukraine further west, with bombardment and strikes against Odesa, Mykolaiv, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.[142][143]\nOn 25 March, the Russian defence ministry said it would seek to occupy major cities in eastern Ukraine.[149] On 31 March, the Ukrainian military confirmed Izium was under Russian control,[150] and PBS News reported renewed shelling and missile attacks in Kharkiv, as bad or worse than before, as peace talks with Russia were to resume in Istanbul.[151]\nAmid the heightened Russian shelling of Kharkiv on 31 March, Russia reported a helicopter strike against an oil supply depot approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of the border in Belgorod, and accused Ukraine of the attack.[152] Ukraine denied responsibility.[153] By 7 April, the renewed massing of Russian invasion troops and tank divisions around the towns of Izium, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian government officials to advise the remaining residents near the eastern border of Ukraine to evacuate to western Ukraine within 2\u20133 days, given the absence of arms and munitions previously promised to Ukraine by then.[154]\nBy 17 April, Russian progress on the southeastern front appeared to be impeded by opposing Ukrainian forces in the large, heavily fortified Azovstal steel mill and surrounding area in Mariupol.[155]\nOn 19 April, The New York Times confirmed that Russia had launched a renewed invasion front referred to as an \"eastern assault\" across a 480-kilometre (300 mi) front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk, with simultaneous missile attacks again directed at Kyiv in the north and Lviv in western Ukraine.[156] As of 30 April, a NATO official described Russian advances as \"uneven\" and \"minor.\"[157] An anonymous US Defence official called the Russian offensive \"very tepid\", \"minimal at best\", and \"anaemic.\"[158]\nIn June 2022 the chief spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defence Igor Konashenkov revealed that Russian troops were divided between the Army Groups \"Center\" commanded by Colonel General Aleksander Lapin and \"South\" commanded by Army General Sergey Surovikin.[159] On 20 July, Lavrov announced that Russia would respond to the increased military aid being received by Ukraine from abroad as justifying the expansion of its special military operation to include objectives in both the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.[160]\nRussian Ground Forces started recruiting volunteer battalions from the regions in June 2022 to create a new 3rd Army Corps within the Western Military District, with a planned strength estimated at 15,500\u201360,000 personnel.[161] Its units were deployed to the front around the time of Ukraine's 9 September Kharkiv oblast counteroffensive, in time to join the Russian retreat, leaving behind tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and personnel carriers: the 3rd Army Corps \"melted away\" according to Forbes, having little or no impact on the battlefield along with other irregular forces.[162]\nOn 13 April, Russian forces intensified their attack on the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol, and the remaining Ukrainian personnel defending it.[163] By 17 April, Russian forces had surrounded the factory. Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said that the Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the renewed ultimatum to surrender and to fight to the last soul.[164] On 20 April, Putin said that the siege of Mariupol could be considered tactically complete, since the 500 Ukrainian troops entrenched in bunkers within the Azovstal iron works and estimated 1,000 Ukrainian civilians were completely sealed off from any type of relief.[165]\nAfter consecutive meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy, UN Secretary-General Guterres on 28 April said he would attempt to organise an emergency evacuation of survivors from Azovstal in accordance with assurances he had received from Putin on his visit to the Kremlin.[166] On 30 April, Russian troops allowed civilians to leave under UN protection.[167] By 3 May, after allowing approximately 100 Ukrainian civilians to depart from the Azovstal steel factory, Russian troops renewed their bombardment of the steel factory.[168] On 6 May, The Daily Telegraph reported that Russia had used thermobaric bombs against the remaining Ukrainian soldiers, who had lost contact with the Kyiv government; in his last communications, Zelenskyy authorised the commander of the besieged steel factory to surrender as necessary under the pressure of increased Russian attacks.[169] On 7 May, the Associated Press reported that all civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal steel works at the end of the three-day ceasefire.[170]\nAfter the last civilians evacuated from the Azovstal bunkers, nearly two thousand Ukrainian soldiers remained barricaded there, 700 of them injured. They were able to communicate a plea for a military corridor to evacuate, as they expected summary execution if they surrendered to Russian forces.[171] Reports of dissent within the Ukrainian troops at Azovstal were reported by Ukrainska Pravda on 8 May indicating that the commander of the Ukrainian Marines assigned to defend the Azovstal bunkers made an unauthorised acquisition of tanks, munitions, and personnel, broke out from the position there and fled. The remaining soldiers spoke of a weakened defensive position in Azovstal as a result, which allowed progress to advancing Russian lines of attack.[172]Ilia Somolienko, deputy commander of the remaining Ukrainian troops barricaded at Azovstal, said: \"We are basically here dead men. Most of us know this and it's why we fight so fearlessly.\"[173]\nOn 16 May, the Ukrainian General staff announced that the Mariupol garrison had \"fulfilled its combat mission\" and that final evacuations from the Azovstal steel factory had begun. The military said that 264 service members were evacuated to Olenivka under Russian control, while 53 of them who were \"seriously injured\" had been taken to a hospital in Novoazovsk also controlled by Russian forces.[174][175] Following the evacuation of Ukrainian personnel from Azovstal, Russian and DPR forces fully controlled all areas of Mariupol. The end of the battle also brought an end to the Siege of Mariupol. Russia press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had guaranteed that the fighters who surrendered would be treated \"in accordance with international standards\" while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address that \"the work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy\u2014and time.\" Some prominent Russian lawmakers called on the government to deny prisoner exchanges for members of the Azov Regiment.[176]\nMilitary control around Donbas as of 24 March 2023: pink highlights areas held by the DNR, LNR, and Russia, yellow highlights areas held by the Ukrainian government.\nA Russian missile attack on Kramatorsk railway station in the city of Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, reportedly killing at least 52 people[177] and injuring as many as 87 to 300.[178] On 11 April, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a major new Russian offensive in the east.[179] American officials said that Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere in Ukraine, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment of infantry and tank divisions to the southeastern Ukraine front.[180][181] Military satellites photographed extensive Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment of its northeastern troops to the southeastern front of the invasion.[182]\nOn 18 April, with Mariupol almost entirely overtaken by Russian forces, the Ukrainian government announced that the second phase of the reinforced invasion of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions had intensified with expanded invasion forces occupying of the Donbas.[183]\nOn 22 May, the BBC reported that after the fall of Mariupol, Russia had intensified offensives in Luhansk and Donetsk while concentrating missile attacks and intense artillery fire on Sievierodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province.[184]\nOn 23 May, Russian forces were reported entering the city of Lyman, fully capturing the city by 26 May.[185][186] Ukrainian forces were reported leaving Sviatohirsk.[187] By 24 May, Russian forces captured the city of Svitlodarsk.[188] On 30 May, Reuters reported that Russian troops had breached the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk.[189] By 2 June, The Washington Post reported that Sievierodonetsk was on the brink of capitulation to Russian occupation with over 80 per cent of the city in the hands of Russian troops.[190] On 3 June, Ukrainian forces reportedly began a counter-attack in Sievierodonetsk. By 4 June, Ukrainian government sources claimed 20% or more of the city had been recaptured.[191]\nOn 12 June, it was reported that possibly as many as 800 Ukrainian civilians (as per Ukrainian estimates) and 300\u2013400 soldiers (as per Russian sources) were besieged at the Azot chemical factory in Severodonetsk.[192][193] With the Ukrainian defences of Severodonetsk faltering, Russian invasion troops began intensifying their attack upon the neighbouring city of Lysychansk as their next target city in the invasion.[194] On 20 June it was reported that Russian troops continued to tighten their grip on Severodonetsk by capturing surrounding villages and hamlets surrounding the city, most recently the village of Metelkine.[195]\nOn 24 June, CNN reported that, amid continuing scorched-earth tactics being applied by advancing Russian troops, Ukraine's armed forces were ordered to evacuate the Severodonetsk; several hundred civilians taking refuge in the Azot chemical plant were left behind in the withdrawal, with some comparing their plight to that of the civilians at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol in May.[196] On 3 July, CBS announced that the Russian defense ministry claimed that the city of Lysychansk had been captured and occupied by Russian forces.[197] On 4 July, The Guardian reported that after the fall of the Luhansk oblast, that Russian invasion troops would continue their invasion into the adjacent Donetsk Oblast to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Bakhmut.[198]\nOn 14 April, Ukrainian troops reportedly blew up a bridge between Kharkiv and Izium used by Russian forces to redeploy troops to Izium, impeding the Russian convoy.[199]\nOn 5 May, David Axe writing for Forbes stated that the Ukrainian army had concentrated its 4th and 17th Tank Brigades and the 95th Air Assault Brigade around Izium for possible rearguard action against the deployed Russian troops in the area; Axe added that the other major concentration of Ukraine's forces around Kharkiv included the 92nd and 93rd Mechanised Brigades which could similarly be deployed for rearguard action against Russian troops around Kharkiv or link up with Ukrainian troops contemporaneously being deployed around Izium.[200]\nOn 13 May, BBC reported that Russian troops in Kharkiv were being retracted and redeployed to other fronts in Ukraine following the advances of Ukrainian troops into surrounding cities and Kharkiv itself, which included the destruction of strategic pontoon bridges built by Russian troops to cross over the Seversky Donets river and previously used for rapid tank deployment in the region.[201]\nMissile attacks and bombardment of the key cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa continued as the second phase of the invasion began.[156] On 22 April 2022, Russia's Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev in a defence ministry meeting said that Russia planned to extend its Mykolaiv\u2013Odesa front after the siege of Mariupol further west to include the breakaway region of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border with Moldova.[202] The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine called this plan imperialism and said that it contradicted previous Russian claims that it did not have territorial ambitions in Ukraine and also that the statement admitted that \"the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\"[202] Georgi Gotev of EURACTIV noted on 22 April that Russian occupation from Odesa to Transnistria would transform Ukraine into a landlocked nation with no practical access to the Black Sea.[203] Russia resumed its missile strikes on Odesa on 24 April, destroying military facilities and causing two dozen civilian casualties.[204]\nExplosions destroyed two Russian broadcast towers in Transnistria on 27 April that had primarily rebroadcast Russian television programming, Ukrainian sources said.[205] Russiah missile attacks at the end of April destroyed runways in Odesa.[206] In the week of 10 May, Ukrainian troops began to dislodge Russian forces from Snake Island in the Black Sea approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) from Odesa.[207] Russia said on 30 June 2022 that it had withdrawn its troops from the island, once their objectives had been completed.[208]\nOn 23 July, CNBC reported a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian port of Odesa, swiftly condemned by world leaders amid a recent U.N. and Turkish-brokered deal to secure a sea corridor for exports of grains and other foodstuffs.[209] On 31 July, CNN reported significantly intensified rocket attacks and bombing of Mykolaiv by Russians, which also killed Ukrainian grain tycoon Oleksiy Vadaturskyi.[210]\nRussian forces continued to fire missiles and drop bombs on the key cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.[156] Russian missiles destroyed the Dnipro International Airport on 10 April 2022.[211] On 2 May the UN, reportedly with the cooperation of Russian troops, evacuated about 100 survivors from the siege of Mariupol to the village of Bezimenne near Donetsk, from whence they would move to Zaporizhzhia.[212] On 28 June, Reuters reported that a Russian missile attack on the city of Kremenchuk northwest of Zaporizhzhia detonated in a public mall and caused at least 18 deaths. France's Emmanuel Macron called it a \"war crime.\"[213][failed verification]\nUkrainian nuclear agency Energoatom called the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant \"extremely tense\", although it was still operated by its Ukrainian staff. As many as 500 Russian soldiers controlled the plant; Kyiv's nuclear agency said they were shelling nearby areas and storing weapons and \"missile systems\" there. Almost the entire country went on air raid alert. \"They already shell the other side of the river Dnipro and the territory of Nikopol,\" Energoatom president Pedro Kotin said.[214] Russia agreed on 19 August to allow IAEA inspectors access to the Zaporizhzhia plant after a phone call from Macron to Putin. As of July 2023, however, access to the plant remained limited and required extensive negotiation.[215]\nRussia reported that 12 attacks with explosions from 50 artillery shells had been recorded by 18 August at the plant and the company town of Enerhodar.[216]Tobias Ellwood, chair of the UK's Defence Select Committee, said on 19 August that any deliberate damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that could cause radiation leaks would be a breach of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, under which an attack on a member state of NATO is an attack on them all. US congressman Adam Kinzinger said the following day that any radiation leak would kill people in NATO countries, an automatic activation of Article 5.[217][218]\nShelling hit coal ash dumps at the neighbouring coal-fired power station on 23 August, and the ash was on fire on 25 August. The 750kV transmission line to the Dniprovska substation, the only one of the four 750 kV transmission lines still undamaged and cut by military action, passes over the ash dumps. At 12:12 p.m. on 25 August the line cut off due to the fire, disconnecting the plant and its two operating reactors from the national grid for the first time since its startup in 1985. In response back-up generators and coolant pumps for reactor 5 started up, and reactor 6 reduced generation.[219]\nIncoming power was still available across the 330 kV line to the substation at the coal-fired station, so the diesel generators were not essential for cooling reactor cores and spent fuel pools. The 750 kV line and reactor 6 resumed operation at 12:29 p.m., but the line was cut by fire again two hours later. The line, but not the reactors, resumed operation again later that day.[219] On 26 August, one reactor restarted in the afternoon and another in the evening, resuming electricity supplies to the grid.[220] On 29 August 2022, an IAEA team led by Rafael Grossi went to the plant to investigate .[221]Lydie Evrard and Massimo Aparo were also on the team. No leaks had been reported at the plant before their arrival, but shelling had occurred days before.[222]\nAnimated map of the Russian invasion from 5 September 2022 to 11 November 2022\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, beginning near Balakliia, led by General Syrskyi.[223] An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive 12 September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for The New York Times to say that it dented the image of a \"Mighty Putin\". Kiev sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive.[224] On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and minister of defence Sergei Shoigu said 300,000 reservists would be called.[225] He also said that his country would use \"all means\" to \"defend itself.\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable, and was an attempt to justify \"Russia's failures.\"[226] British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an \"escalation\",[227] while former Mongolian president Tsakhia Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as \"cannon fodder.\"[228]\nIn late September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine organised referendums on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine. These included the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in Russian occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as well as the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Denounced by Ukraine's government and its allies as sham elections, the elections' official results showed overwhelming majorities in favor of annexation.[229]\nOn 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament.[230] Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all denounced the annexation as illegal.[231]\nAn IAEA delegation visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 3 September, and on 6 September reported damage and security threats caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant.[233] On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, \"completely stopping\" the plant. Energoatom said that preparations were \"underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state.\"[234]\nOn 29 August, Zelenskyy advisedly vowed the start of a full-scale counteroffensive in the southeast. He first announced a counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south concentrating on the Kherson-Mykolaiv region, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as Operational Command South.[236]\nOn 4 September, Zelenskyy announced the liberation of two unnamed villages in Kherson Oblast and one in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities released a photo showing the raising of the Ukrainian flag in Vysokopillia by Ukrainian forces.[237] Ukrainian attacks also continued along the southern frontline, though reports about territorial changes were largely unverifiable.[238] On 12 September, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces had retaken a total of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) from Russia, in both the south and the east. The BBC stated that it could not verify these claims.[239]\nIn October, Ukrainian forces pushed further south towards the city of Kherson, taking control of 1,170 square kilometres (450 sq mi) of territory, with fighting extending to Dudchany.[240][241] On 9 November, defence minister Shoigu ordered Russian forces to leave part of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson, and move to the eastern bank of the Dnieper.[242] On 11 November, Ukrainian troops entered Kherson, as Russia completed its withdrawal. This meant that Russian forces no longer had a foothold on the west (right) bank of the Dnieper.[243]\nControlled by Ukraine Occupied by Russia Map of the Kharkiv front as of 14 November 2023\nUkrainian forces launched another surprise counteroffensive on 6 September in the Kharkiv region near Balakliia led by General Syrskyi.[223] By 7 September, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 kilometres (12 mi) into Russian occupied territory and claimed to have recaptured approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi). Russian commentators said this was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson in response to the Ukrainian offensive there.[244] On 8 September, Ukrainian forces captured Balakliia and advanced to within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) of Kupiansk.[245] Military analysts said Ukrainian forces appeared to be moving towards Kupiansk, a major railway hub, with the aim of cutting off the Russian forces at Izium from the north.[246]\nOn 9 September, the Russian occupation administration of Kharkiv Oblast announced it would \"evacuate\" the civilian populations of Izium, Kupiansk and Velykyi Burluk. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said it believed Kupiansk would likely fall in the next 72 hours,[247] while Russian reserve units were sent to the area by both road and helicopter.[248] On the morning of 10 September, photos emerged claiming to depict Ukrainian troops raising the Ukrainian flag in the centre of Kupiansk,[249] and the ISW said Ukrainian forces had captured approximately 2,500 square kilometres (970 sq mi) by effectively exploiting their breakthrough.[250] Later in the day, Reuters reported that Russian positions in northeast Ukraine had \"collapsed\" in the face of the Ukrainian assault, with Russian forces forced to withdraw from their base at Izium after being cut off by the capture of Kupiansk.[251]\nBy 15 September, an assessment by UK's Ministry of Defence confirmed that Russia had either lost or withdrawn from almost all of their positions west of the Oskil river. The retreating units had also abandoned various high-value military assets.[252] The offensive continued pushing east and by 2 October, Ukrainian Armed Forces had liberated another key city in the Second Battle of Lyman.[253]\nAfter the end of the twin Ukrainian counteroffensives, the fighting shifted to a semi-deadlock during the winter,[254] with heavy casualties but reduced motion of the frontline.[255] Russia launched a self-proclaimed winter offensive in eastern Ukraine, but the campaign ended in \"disappointment\" for Moscow, with limited gains as the offensive stalled.[254][256] Analysts variously blamed the failure on Russia's lack of \"trained men\", and supply problems with artillery ammunition, among other problems.[254][256] Near the end of May, Mark Galeotti assessed that \"after Russia's abortive and ill-conceived winter offensive, which squandered its opportunity to consolidate its forces, Ukraine is in a relatively strong position.\"[257]\nOn 7 February, The New York Times reported that Russians had newly mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers to participate in the offensive in the Donbas, against Ukraine troops already wearied by previous fighting.[258] The Russian private military company Wagner Group took on greater prominence in the war,[259] leading \"grinding advances\" in Bakhmut with tens of thousands of recruits from prison battalions taking part in \"near suicidal\" assaults on Ukrainian positions.[256]\nIn late January 2023, fighting intensified in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.[260] In nearby southern parts of Donetsk Oblast, an intense, three-week Russian assault near the coal-mining town of Vuhledar was called the largest tank battle of the war to date, and ended in disaster for Russian forces, who lost \"at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers\" according to Ukrainian commanders. The British Ministry of Defense stated that \"a whole Russian brigade was effectively annihilated.\"[261][262]\nFollowing defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces have focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half year long stalemate that has prevailed there since the start of the war. Russian forces have sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via Soledar. After taking heavy casualties, Russian and Wagner forces took control of Soledar on 16 January 2023.[263][264] By early February 2023, Bakhmut was facing attacks from north, south and east, with the sole Ukrainian supply lines coming from Chasiv Yar to the west.[265]\nOn 3 March 2023, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed two key bridges, creating the possibility for a controlled fighting withdrawal from eastern sectors of Bakhmut.[266] On 4 March, Bakhmut's deputy mayor told news services that there was street fighting in the city.[267] On 7 March, despite the city's near-encirclement, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian commanders were requesting permission from Kyiv to continue fighting against the Russians in Bakhmut.[268]\nOn 26 March, Wagner Group forces claimed to have fully captured the tactically significant Azom factory in Bakhmut.[269] Appearing before the House Committee on Armed Services on 29 March, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported that, \"for about the last 20, 21 days, the Russia have not made any progress whatsoever in and around Bakhmut.\" Milley described the severe casualties being inflicted upon the Russian forces there as a \"slaughter-fest.\"[270]\nBy the beginning of May, the ISW assessed that Ukraine controlled only 1.89 square kilometres of the city, less than five percent.[271] On 18 May 2023, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces had launched a local counteroffensive, taking back swathes of territory to the north and south of Bakhmut over the course of a few days.[272]\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian forces gradually launched a series of counteroffensives on multiple fronts, including Donetsk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and others.[273] On 8 June 2023, counteroffensive efforts focused near settlements such as Orikhiv, Tokmak, and Bakhmut.[274] However, counteroffensive operations have faced stiff resistance from Russia,[275] and the American think tank Institute for the Study of War called the Russian defensive effort as having \"an uncharacteristic degree of coherency.\"[276] By 12 June, Ukraine reported its fastest advance in seven months, claiming to have liberated several villages and advanced a total of 6.5 km. Russian military bloggers also reported that Ukraine had taken Blahodatne, Makarivka and Neskuchne, and were continuing to push southward.[277] Ukraine continued to liberate settlements over the next few months, raising the Ukrainian flag over the significant settlement of Robotyne in late August.[278]\nOn 24 June, the Wagner Group launched a brief rebellion against the Russian government, capturing several cities in western Russia largely unopposed before marching towards Moscow.[279] This came as the culmination of prolonged infighting and power struggles between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defense.[280] After about 24 hours, the Wagner Group backed down[281] and agreed to a peace deal in which Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin would go into exile in Belarus, and his forces would be free from prosecution.[279] On 27 June, the UK's Ministry of Defence reported that Ukraine were \"highly likely\" to have reclaimed territory in the eastern Donbas region occupied by Russia since 2014 among its advances. Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.[282]\nIn August, The Guardian reported that Ukraine had become the most mined country in the world, with Russia laying millions of mines attempting to thwart Ukraine's counteroffensive. The vast minefields forced Ukraine to extensively de-mine areas to allow advances. Ukrainian officials reported shortages of men and equipment as Ukrainian soldiers unearth five mines for every square metre in certain places.[283]\nFollowing Russia pulling out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the conflict on the Black Sea escalated with Ukraine targeting Russian ships. On 4 August, Ukrainian security service sources reported that the Russian landing ship Olenegorsky Gornyak had been hit and damaged by an unmanned naval drone. Video footage released by Ukraine's security services appeared to show the drone striking the ship, with another video showing the ship seemingly listing to one side.[284] On 12 September, both Ukrainian and Russian sources reported that Russian naval targets in Sevastopol had been struck by unconfirmed weaponry, damaging two military vessels, one of them reportedly a submarine.[285] Ukraine also reported that several oil and gas drilling platforms on the Black Sea held by Russia since 2015 had been retaken.[286]\nOn 21 September, Russia began missile strikes across Ukraine, damaging the country's energy facilities.[288] On 22 September, the US announced it would send long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine,[289] despite the reservations of some government officials.[290] The same day, the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence launched a missile strike on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea, killing several senior military officials.[291][292] In October 2023, it was reported that there was a growth of mutinies among Russian troops due to large amount of losses in Russian offensives around Avdiivka with a lack of artillery, food, water and poor command also being reported.[293]\nThe supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders.[294]\nUS general Mark Milley said that Ukraine's top military commander in the war, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, \"has emerged as the military mind his country needed. His leadership enabled the Ukrainian armed forces to adapt quickly with battlefield initiative against the Russians.\"[295] Russia began the invasion with no overall commander. The commanders of the four military districts were each responsible for their own offensives.[296]\nAfter initial setbacks, the commander of the Russian Southern Military District, Aleksandr Dvornikov. was placed in overall command on 8 April 2022,[297] while still responsible for his own campaign. Russian forces benefited from the centralization of command under Dvornikov,[298] but continued failures to meet expectations in Moscow led to multiple changes in overall command:[299]\ncommander of the Eastern Military District Gennadii Zhidko (Eastern Military District, 26May \u2013 8October 2022)\nOn 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were cancelled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol.[307] On 9 August 2022, large explosions were reported at Saky Air Base in western Crimea. Satellite imagery showed at least eight aircraft damaged or destroyed. Initial speculation attributed the explosions to long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces or an accident;[308] Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi claimed responsibility on 7 September.[309]\nRussia has carried out waves of strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems.[315]\nOn 15 November 2022, Russia fired 85 missiles at the Ukrainian power grid, causing major power outages in Kyiv and neighboring regions.[316] On 31 December, Putin in his New Year address called the war against Ukraine a \"sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants\" as missiles and drones rained down on Kiev.[317]\nOn 10 March 2023, The New York Times reported that Russia had used new hypersonic missiles in a massive missile attack on Ukraine. Such missiles are more effective in evading conventional Ukrainian anti-missile defenses that had previously proved useful against Russia's conventional, non-hypersonic missile systems.[318]\nBy 3 March, Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv scuttled the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, the flagship of the Ukrainian navy, to prevent its capture by Russian forces.[325] On 14 March, the Russian source RT reported that the Russian Armed Forces had captured about a dozen Ukrainian ships in Berdiansk, including the Polnocny-class landing shipYuri Olefirenko.[326] On 24 March, Ukrainian officials said that a Russian landing ship docked in Berdiansk \u2013 initially reported to be the Orsk and then its sister ship, the Saratov \u2013 was destroyed by a Ukrainian rocket attack.[122][327] In March 2022, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) sought to create a safe sea corridor for commercial vessels to leave Ukrainian ports.[328] On 27 March, Russia established a sea corridor 80 miles (130 km) long and 3 miles (4.8 km) wide through its Maritime Exclusion Zone, for the transit of merchant vessels from the edge of Ukrainian territorial waters south-east of Odesa.[329][330] Ukraine closed its ports at MARSEC level 3, with sea mines laid in port approaches, until the end to hostilities.[331]\nThe Russian cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, was, according to Ukrainian sources and a US senior official,[332] hit on 13 April by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, setting the ship afire. The Russian Defence Ministry said the warship had suffered serious damage from a munition explosion caused by a fire, and that its entire crew had been evacuated.[333] Pentagon spokesman John Kirby reported on 14 April that satellite images showed that the Russian warship had suffered a sizeable explosion onboard but was heading to the east for expected repairs and refitting in Sevastopol.[334] Later the same day, the Russian Ministry of Defence stated that the Moskva had sunk while under tow in rough weather.[335] On 15 April, Reuters reported that Russia launched an apparent retaliatory missile strike against the missile factory Luch Design Bureau in Kyiv where the Neptune missiles used in the Moskva attack were manufactured and designed.[336] On 5 May, a US official confirmed that the US gave \"a range of intelligence\" (including real-time battlefield targetingintelligence)[337] to assist in the sinking of the Moskva.[338]\nIn early May, Ukrainian forces launched counterattacks on Snake Island. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed to have repelled these counterattacks. Ukraine released footage of a Russian Serna-class landing craft being destroyed in the Black Sea near Snake Island by a Ukrainian drone.[339] The same day, a pair of Ukrainian Su-27s conducted a high-speed, low level bombing run on Russian-occupied Snake Island; the attack was captured on film by a Baykar Bayraktar TB2 drone.[340] On 1 June, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted that Ukraine's policy of mining its own harbours to impede Russia maritime aggression had contributed to the food export crisis, saying: \"If Kyiv solves the problem of demining ports, the Russian Navy will ensure the unimpeded passage of ships with grain to the Mediterranean Sea.\"[341] On 30 June 2022, Russia announced that it had withdrawn its troops from the island in a \"gesture of goodwill.\"[208] The withdrawal was later confirmed by Ukraine.[342]\nFour days into the invasion, President Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert, raising fears that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine, or a wider escalation of the conflict could occur.[343] Putin alluded in April to the use of nuclear weapons, and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said there was a \"real\" danger of a World War III.[344] On 14 April, CIA director William Burns said that \"potential desperation\" in the face of defeat could encourage President Putin to use tactical nuclear weapons.[345] In response to Russia's disregard of safety precautions during its occupation of the disabled former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl and its firing of missiles in the vicinity of the active Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Zelenskyy called on 26 April for an international discussion on Russia's use of nuclear resources, saying: \"no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has ... If Russia has forgotten what Chernobyl is, it means that global control over Russia's nuclear facilities, and nuclear technology is needed.\"[346] In August shelling around Zaporizhzhia power plant became a crisis, prompting an emergency inspection by the IAEA. Ukraine described the crisis nuclear terrorism by Russia.[347] On 19 September Biden warned of a \"consequential response from the U.S.\"[348] Before the United Nations on 21 September he criticized Putin's nuclear sabre-rattling, calling Putin was \"overt, reckless and irresponsible... A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"[349] In March 2023, Putin announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.[350]\nUkrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion by volunteering for territorial defence units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, building barriers like Czech hedgehogs,[351] and helping to transport refugees.[352] Responding to a call from Ukravtodor, Ukraine's transportation agency, civilians dismantled or altered road signs,[353] constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways.[354] Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops.[355] By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country. The Ukrainian military announced plans for a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence.[356]\nPeople physically blocked Russian military vehicles, sometimes forcing them to retreat.[355][357] The Russian soldiers' response to unarmed civilian resistance varied from reluctance to engage the protesters,[355] to firing into the air, to firing directly into crowds.[358] There have been mass detentions of Ukrainian protesters, and Ukrainian media has reported forced disappearances, mock executions, hostage-taking, extrajudicial killings, and sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian military.[359] To facilitate Ukrainian attacks, civilians reported Russian military positions via a Telegramchatbot and Diia, a Ukrainian government app previously used by citizens to upload official identity and medical documents. In response, Russian forces began destroying mobile phone network equipment, searching door-to-door for smartphones and computers, and in at least one case killed a civilian who had pictures of Russian tanks.[360]\nAs of 21 May 2022, Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine had 700,000 service members on active duty fighting the Russian invasion.[361] Ukraine withdrew soldiers and military equipment back to Ukraine over the course of 2022 that had been deployed to United Nations peacekeeping missions like MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[362]\nAccording to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2023, 31 percent of the world's population live in countries that are leaning towards or supportive of Russia, 30.7 percent live in neutral countries, and 36.2 percent live in countries that are against Russia in some way.[376]\nBy October 2022, three countries\u2014Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia\u2014had declared Russia a \"terrorist state.\"[377] On 1 August, Iceland became the first European country to close its embassy in Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.[378]\nThe invasion prompted Ukraine,[379]Finland and Sweden to officially apply for NATO membership.[380] Finland became a member of NATO in April 2023.[381]\nThe Kiel Institute tracked $155.9 billion from 41 countries and European Union institutions in financial, humanitarian, and military aid to Ukraine from 24 January 2022 to 24 February 2023.[382] NATO is coordinating and helping member states to provide billions of dollars in military equipment and financial aid to Ukraine.[383] The United States has provided the most military assistance, having committed over $29.3 billion from 24 February 2022 to 3 February 2023.[384][e] Many NATO allies, including Germany, have reversed past policies against providing offensive military aid in order to support Ukraine. The European Union, for the first time in its history, supplied lethal arms, and has provided \u20ac3.1 billion to Ukraine.[387] Bulgaria, a major manufacturer of Soviet-pattern weapons, has covertly supplied more than \u20ac2 billion worth of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, including a third of the ammunition needed by the Ukrainian military in the critical early phase of the invasion; Bulgaria also provides fuel supplies and has, at times, covered 40% of the fuel needed by the Ukrainian armed forces.[388]\nCountries on Russia's \"Unfriendly Countries List\" The list includes countries that have imposed sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.[389]\nForeign involvement in the invasion has been worldwide and extensive, with support ranging from foreign military sales and aid, foreign military involvement, foreign sanctions and ramifications, and including foreign condemnation and protest.[390] The US adopted a policy of \"no boots on the ground\" in Ukraine.[391] Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia for recognising the separatist people's republics as independent nations. When the attack began, many countries applied new sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy.[392] The sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, bank transfers, exports, and imports.[390]\nBelarus has allowed Russia to use its territory to stage part of the invasion, and to launch Russian missiles into Ukraine.[393]\nPolitico reported in March 2023 that Chinese state-owned weapons manufacturer Norinco shipped assault rifles, drone parts, and body armor to Russia between June and December 2022, with some shipments via third countries including Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.[394] According to the United States, Chinese ammunition has been used on battlefields in Ukraine.[395] In May 2023, the EU identified that Chinese and UAE firms were supplying weapon components to Russia.[396]\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes.[399] On 17 March 2023 the ICC issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, charging him with individual criminal responsibility in the abduction of children forcibly deported to Russia.[400] It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council[400] (the world's five principal nuclear powers).[401] Moscow has denied any involvement in war crimes, a response Vittorio Bufacchi of University College in Cork says \"has bordered on the farcical,\"[402] and its contention that the images coming out of Bucha were fabricated \"a disingenuous response born by delusional hubris, post-truth on overdrive, (that) does not merit to be taken seriously.\" Even the usually fractured United States Senate came together to call Putin a war criminal.[403] One of several efforts to document Russian war crimes concerns its repeated bombardment of markets and bread lines, destruction of basic infrastructure and attacks on exports and supply convoys, in a country where deliberate starvation of Ukrainians by Soviets the Holodomor still looms large in public memory.[404] Forcible deportation of populations, such as took place in Mariuopol, is another area of focus, since \"(f)orced deportations and transfers are defined both as war crimes under the Fourth Geneva Convention and Protocol II and Article 8 of the Rome Statute\u2014and as crimes against humanity\u2014under Article 7 of the Rome Statute. As both war crimes and crimes against humanity, they have several mechanisms for individual accountability, the International Criminal Court and also, at the individual state level, universal jurisdiction and Magnitsky sanctions legislation.[405]\nRussian and Ukrainian sources have both been said to inflate the casualty numbers for opposing forces and downplay their own losses for the sake of morale.[406] Leaked US documents say that \"under-reporting of casualties within the [Russian] system highlights the military's 'continuing reluctance' to convey bad news up the chain of command.\"[407] Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll.[408] Russia and Ukraine have each admitted suffering \"significant\"[409] and \"considerable\" losses, respectively.[410][411]BBC News has reported that Ukrainian Russian casualty figures included the injured.[412]\nThe numbers of civilian and military deaths have been as always impossible to determine precisely.[413]Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that neither it nor independent conflict monitors were able to verify Russian and Ukrainian claims of enemy losses and suspected that they were inflated.[414] On 12 October 2022, the independent Russian media project iStories, citing sources close to the Kremlin, reported that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, seriously wounded, or gone missing in Ukraine.[415]\nWhile combat deaths can be inferred from a variety of sources including satellite imagery of military action, civilian deaths can be more difficult. On 16 June 2022, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence told CNN that he believed that tens of thousands of Ukrainians had died, adding that he hoped that the total death toll was below 100,000.[416] In the destroyed city of Mariupol alone, Ukrainian officials believe that at least 25,000 have been killed,[417][418] and bodies were still being discovered in September 2022.[419] The mayor said over 10,000 and possibly as many as 20,000 civilians died in the siege of Mariupol and that Russian forces had brought mobile cremation equipment with them when they entered the city.[420][421] Researcher Dan Ciuriak from C.D. Howe Institute in August 2022 estimates the number of killed Mariupol civilians at 25,000,[422] and an investigation by AP from the end of 2022 gives a number of up to 75,000 killed civilians in Mariupol area alone.[423][424]AFP says that \"a key gap in casualty counts is the lack of information from Russian-occupied places like the port city of Mariupol, where tens of thousands of civilians are believed to have died\".[425] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports similar issues and believed that the true civilian casualty numbers were significantly higher than it has been able to confirm.[426]\nOfficial and estimated numbers of prisoners of war (POW) have varied.[437] On 24 February Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of 74th Guards from Kemerovo Oblast had surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and tasked with killing Ukrainians.[438] Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers by 2 March 2022,[439] while Ukraine said it held 562 Russian soldiers as of 20 March.[440] It also released one soldier for five of its own and exchanged another nine for the detained mayor of Melitopol.[441]\nUkrainian soldiers released during the exchange between Ukraine and Russia on 6 May 2023\nOn 24 March 2022, 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russians and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged.[442] On 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged[443] for an unknown number of Russian troops.[444]The Independent on 9 June 2022 cited an intelligence estimate of more than 5,600 Ukrainian soldiers captured, while the Russian servicemen held prisoner fell to 550 from 900 in April after several prisoner exchanges.\nAn 25 August 2022 report by the Humanitarian Research Lab of the Yale School of Public Health identified some 21 filtration camps or Ukrainian \"civilians, POWs, and other personnel\" in the vicinity of Donetsk oblast. Imaging of one of these, Olenivka prison, found two sites with disturbed earth consistent with \"potential graves.\"[445] Kaveh Khoshnood, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said: \"Incommunicado detention of civilians is more than a violation of international humanitarian law\u2014it represents a threat to the public health of those currently in the custody of Russia and its proxies.\" Conditions described by freed prisoners include confinement include exposure, insufficient access to sanitation, food and water, cramped conditions, electrical shocks and physical assault.[445]\nIn March 2023, UN human rights commissioner Volker T\u00fcrk reported that more than 90% of the Ukrainian POWs interviewed by his office, which could only include those who were released from Russia, said in Russia \"they were tortured or ill-treated, notably in penitentiary facilities, including through so-called \u2013 it is an awful phrase \u2013 'welcoming beatings' on their arrival, as well as frequent acts of torture throughout detention.\"[446]\nIn April 2023, several videos started circulating on different websites purportedly showing Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soldiers.[447] Zelensky compared Russian soldiers to \"beasts\" after the footage was circulated.[448] Russian officials opened an investigation of the footage shortly thereafter.[449]\nThe humanitarian impact of the invasion has been extensive and has included negative impacts on international food supplies and the 2022 food crises.[450] An estimated 6.6 million Ukrainians were internally displaced by August 2022, and about the same number were refugees in other countries.[451] The invasion has devastated the cultural heritage of Ukraine,[452] with over 500 Ukrainian cultural heritage sites, including cultural centers, theatres, museums, and churches, affected by \"Russian aggression.\" Ukraine's Minister of Culture called it cultural genocide.[453] Deliberate destruction and looting of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites in this way is considered a war crime.[454][better source needed]\nThe Russian attacks on civilians, causing mass civilian casualties and displacement, have been characterized as genocide and democide.[455] On the 15th of September 2023, a U.N.-mandated investigative body presented their findings that Russian occupiers had tortured Ukrainians so brutally that some of their victims died, and forced families to listen as they raped women next door.[456] The commission has previously said that violations committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, including the use of torture, may constitute crimes against humanity.[457]\nThe war caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s;[458][459] the UN described it as the fastest growing such crisis since World War II.[460] As Russia built up military forces along the Ukrainian border, many neighbouring governments and aid organisations prepared for a mass displacement event in the weeks before the invasion. In December 2021, the Ukrainian defence minister estimated that an invasion could force three to five million people to flee their homes.[461]\nIn the first week of the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine; this subsequently reached over eight million by 31 January 2023.[462][463] On 20 May, NPR reported that, following a significant influx of foreign military equipment into Ukraine, a significant number of refugees are seeking to return to regions of Ukraine which are relatively isolated from the invasion front in south-eastern Ukraine.[464] However, by 3 May, another 8 million people were displaced inside Ukraine.[465]\nMost refugees were women, children, elderly, or disabled.[466] Most male Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from Ukraine as part of mandatory conscription,[467] unless they were responsible for the financial support of three or more children, single fathers, or were the parent/guardian of children with disabilities.[468] Many Ukrainian men, including teenagers, opted to remain in Ukraine voluntarily to join the resistance.[469]\nAccording to the UN High Commission for Refugees as of 13 May 2022, there were 3,315,711 refugees in Poland, 901,696 in Romania, 594,664 in Hungary, 461,742 in Moldova, 415,402 in Slovakia, and 27,308 in Belarus, while Russia reported it had received over 800,104 refugees.[470] By 13 July 2022, over 390,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in the Czech Republic, where the average refugee was a woman accompanied by one child. These refugees were twice as likely to have a college degree as the Czech population as a whole.[471] Turkey has been another significant destination, registering more than 58,000 Ukrainian refugees as of 22 March, and more than 58,000 as of 25 April.[472] The EU invoked the Temporary Protection Directive for the first time in its history, granting Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years.[473] Britain has accepted 146,379 refugees, as well as extending the ability to remain in the UK for 3 years with broadly similar entitlements as the EU, three years residency and access to state welfare and services.[474]\nAccording to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russia has engaged in \"massive deportation\" of over 1.3 million Ukrainian civilians, potentially constituting crimes against humanity.[475] The OSCE and Ukraine have accused Russia of forcibly moving civilians to filtration camps in Russian-held territory, and then into Russia. Ukrainian sources have compared this policy to Soviet-era population transfers and Russian actions in the Chechen War of Independence.[476] For instance, as of 8 April, Russia claimed to have evacuated about 121,000 Mariupol residents to Russia.[476] Also, on 19 October, Russia announced the forced deportation of 60,000 civilians from areas around the line of contact in Kherson oblast.[477]RIA Novosti and Ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to various centers in cities in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine,[478] from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of Russia.[479] In April, Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said that Russia planned to build \"concentration camps\" for Ukrainians in western Siberia, and likely planned to force prisoners to build new cities in Siberia.[480][i]\nBoth Russia and Ukraine faced the prospect of significant population decline even before the war, having among the lowest fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration. It is the first time that two countries with an average age above 40 have gone to war against each other.[482] Russia had a fighting-age (18- to 40-year-old) male population more than four times higher than Ukraine's and slightly higher birth rates, while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in Ukraine.[483]\nSeveral sources have pointed out that the war is considerably worsening Ukraine's demographic crisis, making significant shrinking very likely.[484] A July 2023 study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies stated that \"[r]egardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation, Ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war. Even in 2040 it will have only about 35 million inhabitants, around 20% fewer than before the war (2021: 42.8 million) and the decline in the working-age population is likely to be the most severe and far-reaching.\" The study took different scenarios, from a \"best case\" (end of the war in 2023 without much further escalation) to a \"worst case\" (end of the war in 2025 with further escalation) into account. Flight from war affected especially the southern and eastern regions and especially educated women of child-bearing age and their children. With an estimate of more than 20% of refugees not returning, study author Maryna Tverdostup concluded that long-term shrinking and will significantly impair the conditions for reconstruction.[485]\nSince February 2022, hundreds of thousands of Russians emigrated; estimates range from 370,000 to over 820,000. Combined with mobilization, this possibly removed roughly half a million to one million working-age males from Russia's population.[486] Studies report that this will have a demographic effect, especially in Russia, that lasts much longer than the conflict, and Putin's time in office.[487]\nThey come from different walks of life. Some are journalists like us, but there are also IT experts, designers, artists, academics, lawyers, doctors, PR specialists, and linguists. Most are under 50. Many share western liberal values and hope Russia will be a democratic country one day. Some are LGBTQ+. Sociologists studying the current Russian emigration say there is evidence that those leaving are younger, better educated and wealthier than those staying. More often they are from bigger cities.\nAccording to Johannes Wachs, \"The exodus of skilled human capital, sometimes called brain drain, out of Russia may have a significant effect on the course of the war and the Russian economy in the long run.\"[489]\nAccording to one survey, around 15 percent of those who left returned to Russia, either permanently or to settle their affairs.[490]\nBased on a preliminary assessment, the war has inflicted USD 51 billion in environmental damage in Ukraine; according to a report by the Yale School of the Environment, some 687,000 tons of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling, while nearly 1,600 tons of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water. Hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 70 acres of soil, and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible.[491] Around 30% of Ukraine's land is now littered with explosives and more than 2.4 million hectares of forest have been damaged.[492]\nAccording to Netherlands-based peace organization PAX, Russia's \"deliberate targeting of industrial and energy infrastructure\" has caused \"severe\" pollution, and the use of explosive weapons has left \"millions of tonnes\" of contaminated debris in cities and towns.[493] In early June 2023, the Kakhovka Dam, under Russian occupation, was damaged, causing flooding and triggering warnings of an \"ecological disaster.\"[494]\nThe Ukrainian government, international observers and journalists have described the damage as ecocide.[495] The Ukrainian government is investigating more crimes against the environment and ecocide (a crime in Ukraine).[496] Zelenskyy has met with prominent European figures (Heidi Hautala, Margot Wallstrom, Mary Robinson and Greta Thunberg) to discuss the environmental damage and how to prosecute it.[497]\nPeace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on 28 February, 3 March, and 7 March 2022, in the Gomel Region on the Belarus\u2013Ukraine border, with further talks held on 10 March in Turkey and a fourth round of negotiations beginning 14 March.[499]\nOn 13 July, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that peace talks were frozen and Ukraine must first recover the lost territories in the east of the country, before negotiations come.[500] On 19 July, former Russian President and current Deputy head of the Russian Security CouncilDmitry Medvedev, said: \"Russia will achieve all its goals. There will be peace \u2013 on our terms.\"[501]\nPutin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that any peace plan could only proceed from Ukraine's recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the regions it annexed from Ukraine in September 2022.[502][503] By 29 December, following the Russian declared annexation of multiple Ukrainian oblasts, hopes for Ukrainian peace talks with Russia dimmed significantly with Russia taking a hardline position that the full Russian occupation of the four oblasts would be non-negotiable under any circumstances.[504] In addition, Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine would not hold peace talks with Russia while Putin was president and signed a decree to ban such talks.[505] In January 2023, Putin's spokesperson Peskov said that \"there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine.\"[506]\nIn May 2023, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said peace negotiations to end the Russo-Ukrainian War were \"not possible at this moment\", saying it was clear that Russia and Ukraine were \"completely absorbed in this war\" and each \"convinced that they can win.\"[507]\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said that the peace plans presented by China, Brazil and Indonesia are attempts at mediation on behalf of Russia, and \"they all currently want to be mediators on Russia's side. That's why this sort of mediation currently doesn't fit for us at all because they aren't impartial.\"[508] He said that Ukraine was willing to accept China as a mediator only if Beijing could convince Russia to withdraw from all the territories it had occupied.[509]\n^ abThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were Russian-controlled puppet states that declared their independence from Ukraine in May 2014. In 2022 they received international recognition from each other, Russia, Syria and North Korea, and some other partially recognised states. On 30 September 2022, after a referendum, Russia declared it had formally annexed both entities.\n^By early September 2022 the US had given 126 M777 howitzer cannons and over 800,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition for them.[385] By January 2023 the US had donated 250,000 more 155 mm shells to Ukraine. The US is producing 14,000 155 mm shells monthly and plans to increase production to 90,000 shells per month by 2025.[386]\n^See here for a detailed breakdown of civilian deaths by oblast, according to Ukrainian authorities.\n^The DPR said 1,285 civilians were killed and 4,243 wounded between 1 January 2022 and 22 June 2023,[431][432] of which 8 died and 23 were wounded between 1 January and 25 February 2022,[433] leaving a total of 1,277 killed and 4,220 wounded in the period of the Russian invasion.\n^Most likely, new cities meant new industrial cities in Siberia, the construction plans of which were announced by Shoigu in the fall of 2021.[481]\nEvans, Michael (5 April 2008). \"President tells summit he wants security and friendship\". The Times. p. 46. President Putin, in a bravura performance before the world's media at the end of the Nato summit, warned President Bush and other alliance leaders that their plan to expand eastwards to Ukraine and Georgia \"didn't contribute to trust and predictability in our relations.\nWilson, Andrew (23 December 2021). \"Russia and Ukraine: 'One People' as Putin Claims?\".

        "context": "\nNorwegian world chess champion Magnus Carlsen has confirmed that he pulled out of a recent tournament and quit during a match against Hans Niemann because he believes the 19-year-old American has been cheating.\nCarlsen last week sent shockwaves across the chess world when he resigned after just one move during a match against Niemann in the Julius Baer Generation Cup. The move came just one week after the 31-year-old grandmaster withdrew from the Sinquefield Cup in the U.S. after losing to Niemann, who has admitted to cheating in online games in the past. Many speculated Carlsen's abrupt withdrawal was connected to the ongoing alleged cheating scandal, although he had initially refused to say so.\nOn Monday, Carlsen confirmed in a statement that he made the \"unprecedented\" decisions because he believed that Niemann's cheating goes beyond what the American has already admitted to.\n\"I know that my actions have frustrated many in the chess community,\" Carlsen wrote. \"I'm frustrated. I want to play chess. I want to continue to play chess at the highest level in the best events.\"\n\"I believe that cheating in chess is a big deal and an existential threat to the game,\" he continued. \"I also believe that chess organizers and all those who care about the sanctity of the game we love should seriously consider increasing security measures and methods of cheat detection for over the board chess.\"\nNiemann had previously admitted he had not played fairly in non-competitive games on chess.com when he was younger, Reuters reported. But he has denied any cheating while playing live games.\nAfter Carlsen resigned from the tournament, Sinquefield Cup chief arbiter Chris Bird said there had been \"no indication that any player has been playing unfairly,\" according to Reuters.\nBut Carlsen on Monday said that he believes that Niemann has cheated more than previously disclosed and said his demeanor during their match in the Sinquefield Cup confirmed his suspicions.\n\"I believe that Niemann has cheated more \u2014 and more recently \u2014 than he has publicly admitted,\" Carlsen wrote. \"His over the board progress has been unusual, and throughout our game in the Sinquefield Cup I had the impression that he wasn't tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as black in a way I think only a handful of players can do. This game contributed to changing my perspective.\"\nCarlsen alluded to their being more information he would like to share, but said he is \"limited\" in what he can reveal \"without explicit permission from Niemann to speak openly.\"\n\"We must do something about cheating, and for my part going forward, I don't want to play against people that have cheated repeatedly in the past, because I don't know what they are capable of doing in the future,\" he said.",

        "context": "\nThis is a record of Argentina's results at the FIFA World Cup. Argentina is one of the most successful teams in the tournament's history, having won three World Cups: in 1978, 1986, and 2022. Argentina has also been runner-up three times: in 1930, 1990 and 2014. In 18 World Cup tournaments, Argentina has 47 victories in 88 matches. The team was present in all but four of the World Cups, being behind only Brazil and Germany in number of appearances.\nThe inaugural FIFA World Cup tournament culminated with Argentina facing hosts and current Olympic champions Uruguay. The match was turned twice: Argentina went into half-time with a 2\u20131 lead in spite of an early goal for Uruguay, but the hosts ultimately won 4\u20132. Guillermo St\u00e1bile, one of Argentina's scorers, became the tournament's top striker with 8 goals total.\nArgentina hosted the 1978 edition of the World Cup and reached the final. The Netherlands had already played the previous final in West Germany 1974 - and also lost to the hosts.\nDiego Maradona was 17 years old at this point and already a star in his home country, but did not make the squad as coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti felt he was too inexperienced to handle the pressure of this major tournament. The playmaker position was instead filled by Mario Kempes, who ended up becoming the first Argentinian to win the Golden Ball in addition to being the tournament's top scorer with 6 goals.\nThe Dutch side was missing a superstar of their own: Johan Cruyff did not join the 1978 World Cup squads due to the aftermath of a kidnapping attempt which occurred in 1977. He only disclosed this information 30 years later.\nThe closely contested match was influenced by a hostile atmosphere and ended with the Dutch players refusing to attend the award ceremony after Argentina grabbed the title in extra time.\nEight years after the victory on home soil, Argentina won the World Cup title for the second time. Diego Maradona was voted Best Player of the tournament after scoring five goals and assisting the decisive 3-2 by Jorge Burruchaga in the 84th minute of the final. The match was played in front of a record attendance of 114,600 people.\nIn 1990, Argentina faced West Germany in a repeat of the 1986 edition. Pedro Monz\u00f3n became the first player ever to be sent off in a World Cup final, but was later joined by teammate Gustavo Dezotti. The match was decided by a penalty kick in favour of Germany.\nIn 2014, Argentina reached the final for the fifth time and for a third time had to face the German team, making it the most recurrent meeting for a final. In spite of a number of chances on both sides, regular time finished goalless. In the second half of extra time, substitute striker Mario G\u00f6tze scored the decisive goal for Germany.\nArgentina opened up the scoring when Messi scored a penalty kick, and doubled their lead with a Di Maria goal in the 36th minute.[4] France made two substitutions in the first half, but went into half-time trailing 0\u20132.[5] Despite not having a shot until after the 80th minute, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area. Mbapp\u00e9 scored the penalty, and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[5] With the scores tied, the match went to extra time. Messi scored again for Argentina in the second extra time half. Mbapp\u00e9 was awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute after his initial shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbapp\u00e9 scored his third goal, becoming the second player to score a hat-trick in the final of a men's World Cup.[5] With the scores tied at 3\u20133, the match was completed by a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4\u20132.[5]\nTeams in bold denote world cup winners, teams in italics show teams which played its first match ever in a World Cup against Argentina.\nTeams with a * mark no longer exist. East Germany was annexed to Germany. Soviet Union now plays as Russia.\n+Played as Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.\nThrough Argentinian team history, several coaches had trained it with different football styles from offensive to defensive tactics. There are two predominant 'football schools' about world champions coaches C\u00e9sar Menotti who propagates possession and well-look play and Carlos Bilardo who prioritize results and tactical order. These head coaches divides Argentine fans kindly.[6] Other managers such as Marcelo Bielsa has got his own football style. In another way this list shows records in World Cups and in qualifying stages excluding friendlies.\nFIFA delegates regional qualification and other organization affairs to continental conferences, so it divides into six differents of them grouped by geographical location. Argentina plays in CONMEBOL conference in South America. Due to World Cup rules that two teams of same confederation can not play in the same group in first round except for UEFA, it commonly faces teams which plays outside its continent most recently from Africa and Asia. Argentine national has never played versus an Oceanian (OFC) squad.\n'Albiceleste' has played against first-world-cup teams more than other, doing so 17 times, 7 of them being the first World Cup match ever. This list shows records versus those selections including all-debutants 1930 edition.

Even more, game against Brazil ended in a 0\u20130 draw.\nMost played penalty shoot-outs: 7 (twice in 1990, 1998, 2006, 2014 and twice in 2022).\nArgentina's game versus West Germany in 1958 featured a yellow jersey instead of the traditional light blue and white colors or blue as alternate. This was because both teams wore white jerseys, creating confusion. As the South American side forgot to bring an alternate one, they decided to borrow jerseys from local team club Malm\u00f6. Germany won 3\u20131.[11][12]\nIn the 1978 France - Hungary match something similar occurred. Both teams arrived to the match with white jerseys, so France was forced to borrow jerseys from Mar del Plata's local club Kimberley. France wore striped green and white keeping the traditional blue shorts and red socks. France won 3\u20131.[13][14]\nAs a major CONMEBOL member, Argentina has been represented by match officials in nearly every tournament. In 2006, Horacio Elizondo refereed the final between France and Italy, where he sent off Zinedine Zidane after a headbutt to an opponent. In 2018, N\u00e9stor Pitana did it when France played versus Croatia. They are also the only two who refereed the opening game in the same tournament.\n^ abThis is one of several goals for which the statistical details are disputed.

        "context": "\nCharles became king upon his mother's death on 8 September 2022. At the age of 73, he became the oldest person to accede to the British throne, after having been the longest-serving heir apparent and Prince of Wales in British history. His coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 2023.\nChristening of Charles (centre, wearing the royal christening gown) in 1948: (from left to right) his grandfather King George VI; his mother, Princess Elizabeth, holding him; his father, Philip; and his grandmother Queen Elizabeth\nWhen Charles turned five, a governess, Catherine Peebles, was appointed to oversee his education at Buckingham Palace.[11] Charles then commenced classes at Hill House School in west London on 7 November 1956.[12] He was the first heir apparent to attend school, rather than be educated by a private tutor.[13] He did not receive preferential treatment from the school's founder and headmaster, Stuart Townend, who advised the Queen to have Charles train in football, because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field.[14] Charles subsequently attended two of his father's former schools: Cheam School in Hampshire,[15] from 1958,[12] followed by Gordonstoun, in the north-east of Scotland, beginning classes there in April 1962.[12][16]\nWith his parents and sister Anne, October 1957\nIn his 1994 authorised biography by Jonathan Dimbleby, Charles's parents were described as physically and emotionally distant and Philip was blamed for his disregard of Charles's sensitive nature, including forcing him to attend Gordonstoun, where he was bullied.[17] Though Charles reportedly described Gordonstoun, noted for its especially rigorous curriculum, as \"Colditz in kilts\",[15] he later praised the school, stating it had taught him \"a great deal about myself and my own abilities and disabilities\". He said in a 1975 interview he was \"glad\" he had attended Gordonstoun and that the \"toughness of the place\" was \"much exaggerated\".[18] In 1966, Charles spent two terms at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia, during which time he visited Papua New Guinea on a school trip with his history tutor, Michael Collins Persse.[19][20] In 1973, Charles described his time at Timbertop as the most enjoyable part of his whole education.[21] Upon his return to Gordonstoun, Charles emulated his father in becoming head boy and left in 1967, with six GCE O-levels and two A-levels in history and French, at grades B and C respectively.[19][22] On his education, Charles later remarked, \"I didn't enjoy school as much as I might have; but, that was only because I'm happier at home than anywhere else\".[18]\nCharles began to take on more public duties, founding the Prince's Trust in 1976[32] and travelling to the United States in 1981.[33] In the mid-1970s, Charles expressed an interest in serving as governor-general of Australia, at the suggestion of Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser; however, because of a lack of public enthusiasm, nothing came of the proposal.[34] In reaction, Charles commented, \"so, what are you supposed to think when you are prepared to do something to help and you are just told you're not wanted?\"[35]\nCharles's great-uncle Lord Mountbatten advised him to \"sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down\", but, for a wife, he \"should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for ... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage\".[47] Early in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with 25-year-old Charles about a potential marriage to Amanda Knatchbull, Mountbatten's granddaughter.[48] Charles wrote to Amanda's mother, Lady Brabourne, who was also his godmother, expressing interest in her daughter. Lady Brabourne replied approvingly; though, she suggested that a courtship with a 16-year-old was premature.[49] Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 visit to India. Both fathers, however, objected; Prince Philip feared that his famous uncle[note 6] would eclipse Charles, while Lord Brabourne warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.[50]\nCharles first met Lady Diana Spencer in 1977, while he was visiting her home, Althorp. He was then the companion of her elder sister Sarah and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten. Soon, according to Dimbleby, \"without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride\" and she accompanied Charles on visits to Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House.[51]\nCharles's cousin Norton Knatchbull and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her.[52] Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and paparazzi. When Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.[53] He proposed to Diana in February 1981, with their engagement becoming official on 24 February; the wedding took place in St Paul's Cathedral on 29 July. Upon his marriage, Charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits of the Duchy of Cornwall from 50 per cent to 25 per cent.[54] The couple lived at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury, and had two children: William, in 1982, and Harry, in 1984.[13]\nWithin five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couple's incompatibility and near 13-year age difference.[55][56] By November 1986, Charles had fully resumed his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles.[57] In a videotape recorded by Peter Settelen in 1992, Diana admitted that she had been \"deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment.\"[58][59] It was assumed that she was referring to Barry Mannakee,[60] who had been transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986, after his managers determined his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate.[59][61] Diana later commenced a relationship with Major James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor.[62]\nCharles and Diana's evident discomfort in each other's company led to them being dubbed \"The Glums\" by the press.[63] Diana exposed Charles's affair with Parker Bowles in a book by Andrew Morton, Diana: Her True Story. Audio tapes of her own extramarital flirtations also surfaced,[63] as did persistent suggestions that Hewitt is Prince Harry's father, based on a physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry. However, Harry had already been born by the time Diana's affair with Hewitt began.[64]\nIn December 1992, John Major announced the couple's legal separation in the House of Commons. Early the following year, the British press published transcripts of a passionate, bugged telephone conversation between Charles and Parker Bowles that had taken place in 1989, which was dubbed \"Camillagate\" and \"Tampongate\".[65] Charles subsequently sought public understanding in a television film with Dimbleby, Charles: The Private Man, the Public Role, broadcast on 29 June 1994. In an interview in the film, Charles confirmed his own extramarital affair with Parker Bowles, saying that he had rekindled their association in 1986, only after his marriage to Diana had \"irretrievably broken down\".[66][67] This was followed by Diana's own admission of marital troubles in an interview on the BBC current affairs show Panorama, broadcast on 20 November 1995.[68] Referring to Charles's relationship with Parker Bowles, she said, \"well, there were three of us in this marriage. So, it was a bit crowded.\" She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability for kingship.[69] Charles and Diana divorced on 28 August 1996,[70] after being advised by the Queen in December 1995 to end the marriage.[71] The couple shared custody of their children.[72]\nDiana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. Charles flew to Paris with Diana's sisters to accompany her body back to Britain.[73] In 2003, Diana's butler Paul Burrell published a note that he claimed had been written by Diana in 1995, in which there were allegations that Charles was \"planning 'an accident' in [Diana's] car, brake failure and serious head injury\", so that he could marry again.[74] When questioned by the Metropolitan Police inquiry team as a part of Operation Paget, Charles told the authorities that he did not know about his former wife's note from 1995 and could not understand why she had those feelings.[75]\nCharles was the only member of the royal family to have a civil, rather than a church, wedding in England. British government documents from the 1950s and 1960s, published by the BBC, stated that such a marriage was illegal; these claims were dismissed by Charles's spokesman[79] and explained by the sitting government to have been repealed by the Registration Service Act 1953.[80]\nThe union was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, with a subsequent religious blessing at the castle's St George's Chapel. The wedding venue was changed to Windsor Guildhall after it was realised a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. Four days before the event, it was postponed from the originally scheduled date of 8 April until the following day in order to allow Charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.[81]\nIn 1965, Charles undertook his first public engagement by attending a student garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse.[85] During his time as Prince of Wales, he undertook official duties on behalf of the Queen,[86] completing 10,934 engagements between 2002 and 2022.[87] He officiated at investitures and attended the funerals of foreign dignitaries.[88] Charles made regular tours of Wales, fulfilling a week of engagements each summer, and attending important national occasions, such as opening the Senedd.[89] The six trustees of the Royal Collection Trust met three times a year under his chairmanship.[90] Charles also represented his mother at the independence celebrations in Fiji in 1970,[91] the Bahamas in 1973,[92] Papua New Guinea in 1975,[93] Zimbabwe in 1980,[94] and Brunei in 1984.[95]\nIn 1983, Christopher John Lewis, who had fired a shot with a .22 rifle at the Queen in 1981, attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Charles, who was visiting New Zealand with Diana and William.[96] While Charles was visiting Australia on Australia Day in January 1994, David Kang fired two shots at him from a starting pistol in protest of the treatment of several hundred Cambodian asylum seekers held in detention camps.[97] In 1995, Charles became the first member of the royal family to visit the Republic of Ireland in an official capacity.[98] In 1997, Charles represented the Queen at the Hong Kong handover ceremony.[99][100]\nCharles's ninth tour of New Zealand in 2015\nAt the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Charles caused controversy when he shook hands with the president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, who had been seated next to him. Charles's office subsequently released a statement saying that he could not avoid shaking Mugabe's hand and that he \"finds the current Zimbabwean regime abhorrent\".[101]\nCharles and Camilla made their first joint trip to the Republic of Ireland in May 2015. The trip was called an important step in \"promoting peace and reconciliation\" by the British Embassy.[105] During the trip, Charles shook hands in Galway with Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn F\u00e9in and widely believed to be the leader of the IRA, the militant group that had assassinated Lord Mountbatten in 1979. The event was described by the media as a \"historic handshake\" and a \"significant moment for Anglo-Irish relations\".[106]\nWith Queen Elizabeth II and other world leaders to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day on 5 June 2019\nCommonwealth heads of government decided at their 2018 meeting that Charles would be the next Head of the Commonwealth after the Queen.[107] The head is chosen and therefore not hereditary.[108] In March 2019, at the request of the British government, Charles and Camilla went on an official tour of Cuba, making them the first British royals to visit the country. The tour was seen as an effort to form a closer relationship between Cuba and the UK.[109]\nCharles contracted COVID-19 during the pandemic in March 2020.[110][111] Several newspapers were critical that Charles and Camilla were tested promptly at a time when many NHS doctors, nurses and patients had been unable to be tested expeditiously.[112] He tested positive for COVID-19 for a second time in February 2022.[113] He and Camilla, who also tested positive, had received doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021.[114]\nDelivering the Queen's Speech to the British Parliament on behalf of his mother, May 2022\nCharles acceded to the British throne on his mother's death on 8 September 2022. He was the longest-serving British heir apparent, having surpassed Edward VII's record of 59 years on 20 April 2011.[119] When he became monarch at the age of 73, Charles was the oldest person to do so, the previous record holder being William IV, who was 64 when he became king in 1830.[120]\nCharles gave his first speech to the nation at 6 pm on 9 September, in which he paid tribute to his mother and announced the appointment of his elder son, William, as Prince of Wales.[121] The following day, the Accession Council publicly proclaimed Charles as king, the ceremony being televised for the first time.[122][107] Attendees included the new queen consort, Camilla; William, Prince of Wales; and the prime minister, Liz Truss, along with her six living predecessors.[123] The proclamation was also read out by local authorities around the United Kingdom. Other realms signed and read their own proclamations, as did Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, British Overseas Territories, Crown Dependencies, Canadian provinces, and Australian states.[124]\nCharles and Camilla have engaged in two state visits and received one in return. In November 2022 they hosted the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, during the first official state visit to Britain of Charles's reign.[132] In March the following year, the King and Queen embarked on a state visit to Germany; Charles became the first British monarch to address the Bundestag.[133] Similarly, in September, he became the first British monarch to give a speech from France's Senate chamber during his state visit to the country.[134]\nSince founding the Prince's Trust in 1976, using his \u00a37,500 of severance pay from the Navy,[135] Charles has established 16 more charitable organisations and now serves as president of each.[136][86] Together, they form a loose alliance, the Prince's Charities, which describes itself as \"the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising over \u00a3100 million annually ... [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise, and international\".[136] As Prince of Wales, Charles became patron or president of over 800 other charities and organisations.[85]\nCharles has supported humanitarian projects; for example, he and his sons took part in ceremonies that marked the 1998 International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.[138] Charles was one of the first public figures to express strong concerns about the human rights record of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, initiating objections in the international arena,[140] and subsequently supported the FARA Foundation,[7] a charity for Romanian orphans and abandoned children.[141]\nTwo of Charles's charities, the Prince's Foundation and the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, came under scrutiny in 2021 and 2022 for accepting donations the media deemed inappropriate. In August 2021, it was announced that the Prince's Foundation was launching an investigation into the reports,[142] with Charles's support.[143] The Charity Commission also launched an investigation into allegations that the donations meant for the Prince's Foundation had been instead sent to the Mahfouz Foundation.[144] In February 2022, the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into the cash-for-honours allegations linked to the foundation,[145] passing their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service for deliberation on 31 October.[146] In August 2023, the Metropolitan Police announced that they had concluded their investigations and no further actions would be taken.[147]\nThe Times reported in June 2022 that, between 2011 and 2015, Charles accepted \u20ac3 million in cash from Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.[148][149] There was no evidence that the payments were illegal or that it was not intended for the money to go to the charity,[149] although, the Charity Commission stated it would review the information[150] and announced in July 2022 that there would be no further investigation.[151] In the same month, The Times reported that the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund received a donation of \u00a31 million from Bakr bin Laden and Shafiq bin Laden \u2013 both half-brothers of Osama bin Laden \u2013 during a private meeting in 2013.[152][153] The Charity Commission described the decision to accept donations as a \"matter for trustees\" and added that no investigation was required.[154]\nLetters sent by Charles to government ministers in 2004 and 2005 expressing his concerns over various policy issues \u2013 the so-called black spider memos \u2013 presented potential embarrassment following a challenge by The Guardian newspaper to release the letters under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In March 2015, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom decided that Charles's letters must be released[161] and the letters were published by the Cabinet Office on 13 May.[162] The reaction was largely supportive of Charles, with little criticism of him;[163] the press variously described the memos as \"underwhelming\"[164] and \"harmless\",[165] and concluded that their release had \"backfired on those who seek to belittle him\".[166] It was revealed in the same year that Charles had access to confidential Cabinet papers.[167]\nIn October 2020, a letter sent by Charles to Australian governor-general John Kerr, after Kerr's dismissal of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975, was released as part of the collection of palace letters regarding the Australian constitutional crisis.[168] In the letter, Charles was supportive of Kerr's decision, writing that what Kerr \"did last year was right and the courageous thing to do\".[168]\nThe Times reported in June 2022 that Charles had privately described the British government's Rwanda asylum plan as \"appalling\" and he feared that it would overshadow the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda that same month.[169] It was later claimed that Cabinet ministers had warned Charles to avoid making political comments, as they feared a constitutional crisis could arise if he continued to make such statements once he became king.[170]\nCharles has openly expressed his views on architecture and urban planning; he fostered the advancement of New Classical architecture and asserted that he \"care[s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life.\"[171] In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 30 May 1984, he described a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend\" and deplored the \"glass stumps and concrete towers\" of modern architecture.[172] Charles called for local community involvement in architectural choices and asked, \"why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right angles \u2013 and functional?\"[172] Charles has \"a deep understanding of Islamic art and architecture\" and has been involved in the construction of a building and garden at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, which combine Islamic and Oxford architectural styles.[173]\nIn Charles's 1989 book A Vision of Britain, and in speeches and essays, he has been critical of modern architecture, arguing that traditional designs and methods should guide contemporary ones.[174] He has continued to campaign for traditional urbanism, human scale, restoration of historic buildings, and sustainable design[175] despite criticism in the press.[176] Two of his charities \u2013 the Prince's Regeneration Trust and the Prince's Foundation for Building Community, which were later merged into one charity \u2013 promote his views. The village of Poundbury was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall to a master plan by L\u00e9on Krier, under the guidance of Charles and in line with his philosophy.[171] In 2013, developments for the suburb of Nansledan began on the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall with Charles's endorsement.[177] Charles helped purchase Dumfries House and its complete collection of 18th century furnishings in 2007, taking a \u00a320m loan from his charitable trust to contribute toward the \u00a345m cost.[178] The house and gardens remain property of the Prince's Foundation and serve as a museum and community and skills training centre.[179][180] This led to the development of Knockroon, called the \"Scottish Poundbury\".[181][182]\nSince the 1970s, Charles has promoted environmental awareness.[192] At the age of 21, he delivered his first speech on environmental issues in his capacity as the chairman of the Welsh Countryside Committee.[193] An avid gardener, Charles has also emphasised the importance of talking to plants, stating that \"I happily talk to the plants and trees, and listen to them. I think it's absolutely crucial\".[194] His interest in gardening began in 1980 when he took over the Highgrove estate.[195] His \"healing garden\", based on sacred geometry and ancient religious symbolism, went on display at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2002.[195]\nUpon moving into Highgrove House, Charles developed an interest in organic farming, which culminated in the 1990 launch of his own organic brand, Duchy Originals,[196] which sells more than 200 different sustainably produced products; the profits (over \u00a36 million by 2010) are donated to the Prince's Charities.[196][197] Charles became involved with farming and various industries within it, regularly meeting with farmers to discuss their trade. A prominent critic of the practice,[198] Charles has also spoken against the use of GM crops, and in a letter to Tony Blair in 1998, Charles criticised the development of genetically modified foods.[199]\nThe Sustainable Markets Initiative \u2013 a project that encourages putting sustainability at the centre of all activities \u2013 was launched by Charles at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos in January 2020.[200] In May of the same year, the initiative and the World Economic Forum initiated the Great Reset project, a five-point plan concerned with enhancing sustainable economic growth following the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[201]\nAs early as 1985, Charles was questioning meat consumption. In the 1985 Royal Special television programme, he told host Alastair Burnet that \"I actually now don't eat as much meat as I used to. I eat more fish.\" He also pointed out the societal double standard whereby eating meat is not questioned but eating less meat means \"all hell seems to break loose.\"[202] In 2021, Charles spoke to the BBC about the environment and revealed that, two days per week, he eats no meat nor fish and, one day per week, he eats no dairy products.[203] In 2022, it was reported that Charles eats a breakfast of fruit salad, seeds, and tea. He does not eat lunch, but takes a break for tea at 5:00 p.m. and eats dinner at 8:30 p.m., returning to work until midnight or after.[204] Ahead of Christmas dinner in 2022, Charles confirmed to animal rights group PETA that foie gras would not be served at any royal residences; he had stopped the use of foie gras at his own properties for more than a decade before taking the throne.[205] During a September 2023 state banquet at the Palace of Versailles, it was reported that Charles did not want foie gras or out-of-season asparagus on the menu. Instead he was served lobster. Charles does not like chocolate, coffee, or garlic.[206]\nThe holy chrism oil used at his coronation was vegan, made from oils of olive, sesame, rose, jasmine, cinnamon, neroli, and benzoin, along with amber and orange blossom. His mother's chrism oil contained animal-based oils.[207]\nCharles delivered a speech at the 2021 G20 Rome summit, describing COP26 as \"the last chance saloon\" for preventing climate change and asking for actions that would lead to a green-led, sustainable economy.[208] In his speech at the opening ceremony for COP26, he repeated his sentiments from the previous year, stating that \"a vast military-style campaign\" was needed \"to marshal the strength of the global private sector\" for tackling climate change.[209]\nCharles's Duchy Originals produced a variety of complementary medicinal products, including a \"Detox Tincture\" that Ernst denounced as \"financially exploiting the vulnerable\" and \"outright quackery\".[220] Charles personally wrote at least seven letters[221] to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency shortly before it relaxed the rules governing labelling of such herbal products, a move that was widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies.[222] It was reported in October 2009 that Charles had lobbied the health secretary, Andy Burnham, regarding greater provision of alternative treatments in the NHS.[220]\nFollowing accounting irregularities, the FIH announced its closure in April 2010.[223][224] The FIH was re-branded and re-launched later in the year as the College of Medicine,[224][225] of which Charles became a patron in 2019.[226]\nCharles has been a keen salmon angler since youth and supported Orri Vigf\u00fasson's efforts to protect the North Atlantic salmon. He frequently fishes the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and claims his most special angling memories are from his time spent in Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, Iceland.[230] Charles is a supporter of Burnley F.C..[231]\nApart from hunting, Charles has also participated in target rifle competitions, representing the House of Lords in the Vizianagram Match (Lords vs. Commons) at Bisley.[232] He became President of the British National Rifle Association in 1977.[233]\nCharles is a keen watercolourist, having published books on the subject and exhibited and sold a number of his works to raise money for charity; in 2016, it was estimated that he had sold lithographs of his watercolours for a total of \u00a32 million from a shop at his Highgrove House residence. For his 50th birthday, 50 of his watercolours were exhibited at Hampton Court Palace and, for his 70th birthday, his works were exhibited at the National Gallery of Australia.[238] In 2001, 20 lithographs of his watercolour paintings illustrating his country estates were exhibited at the Florence International Biennale of Contemporary Art[239] and 79 of his paintings were put on display in London in 2022. To mark the 25th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1994, the Royal Mail issued a series of postage stamps that featured his paintings.[238] Charles is Honorary President of the Royal Academy of Arts Development Trust[240] and, in 2015, 2022, and 2023, commissioned paintings of 12 D-Day veterans, seven Holocaust survivors, and ten members of the Windrush generation, respectively, which went on display at the Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace.[241][242][243]\nCharles is the author of several books and has contributed a foreword or preface to numerous books by others. He has also written, presented, or been featured in a variety of documentary films.[244]\nShortly after his accession to the throne, Charles publicly described himself as \"a committed Anglican Christian\";[245] at age 16, during Easter 1965, he had been confirmed into the Anglican communion by Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[246] The King is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England[247] and a member of the Church of Scotland; Charles swore an oath to uphold that church immediately after he was proclaimed king.[248] He attends services at various Anglican churches close to Highgrove[249] and attends the Church of Scotland's Crathie Kirk with the rest of the royal family when staying at Balmoral Castle.\nIn his 1994 documentary with Dimbleby, Charles said that, when king, he wished to be seen as a \"defender of faith\", rather than the British monarch's traditional title of Defender of the Faith, \"preferr[ing] to embrace all religious traditions and 'the pattern of the divine, which I think is in all of us.'\"[260] This attracted controversy at the time, as well as speculation that the coronation oath might be altered.[261] He stated in 2015 that he would retain the title of Defender of the Faith, whilst \"ensuring that other people's faiths can also be practised\", which he sees as a duty of the Church of England.[262] Charles reaffirmed this theme shortly after his accession and declared that his duties as sovereign included \"the duty to protect the diversity of our country, including by protecting the space for faith itself and its practice through the religions, cultures, traditions, and beliefs to which our hearts and minds direct us as individuals.\"[245] His inclusive, multi-faith approach and his own Christian beliefs were expressed in his first Christmas message as king.[263]\nSince his birth, Charles has received close media attention, which increased as he matured. It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and their aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king.[264]\nDescribed as the \"world's most eligible bachelor\" in the late 1970s,[265] Charles was subsequently overshadowed by Diana.[266] After her death, the media regularly breached Charles's privacy and printed expos\u00e9s. Known for expressing his opinions, when asked during an interview to mark his 70th birthday whether this would continue in the same way once he is king, he responded \"No. It won't. I'm not that stupid. I do realise that it is a separate exercise being sovereign. So, of course, you know, I understand entirely how that should operate\".[267]\nA 2018 BMG Research poll found that 46 per cent of Britons wanted Charles to abdicate immediately on his mother's death, in favour of William.[268] However, a 2021 opinion poll reported that 60 per cent of the British public had a favourable opinion of him.[269] On his accession to the throne, The Statesman reported an opinion poll that put Charles's popularity with the British people at 42 per cent.[270] More recent polling suggested that his popularity increased sharply after he became king.[271] According to YouGov, as of April 2023, Charles had an approval rating of 55 per cent.[272]\nIn 1994, German tabloid Bild published nude photos of Charles that were taken while he was vacationing in Le Barroux; they had reportedly been put up for sale for \u00a330,000.[273] Buckingham Palace reacted by stating that it was \"unjustifiable for anybody to suffer this sort of intrusion\".[274]\nCharles, \"so often a target of the press, got his chance to return fire\" in 2002, when addressing \"scores of editors, publishers, and other media executives\" gathered at St Bride's Fleet Street to celebrate 300 years of journalism.[note 7][275] Defending public servants from \"the corrosive drip of constant criticism\", he noted that the press had been \"awkward, cantankerous, cynical, bloody-minded, at times intrusive, at times inaccurate, and at times deeply unfair and harmful to individuals and to institutions.\"[275] But, he concluded, regarding his own relations with the press, \"from time to time we are probably both a bit hard on each other, exaggerating the downsides and ignoring the good points in each.\"[275]\nThe Independent noted in 2015 that Charles would only speak to broadcasters \"on the condition they have signed a 15-page contract, demanding that Clarence House attends both the 'rough cut' and 'fine cut' edits of films and, if it is unhappy with the final product, can 'remove the contribution in its entirety from the programme'.\"[278] This contract stipulated that all questions directed at Charles must be pre-approved and vetted by his representatives.[278]\nClarence House, previously the residence of the Queen Mother, was Charles's official London residence from 2003, after being renovated at a cost of \u00a34.5 million.[281][282] He previously shared apartments eight and nine at Kensington Palace with Diana before moving to York House at St James's Palace, which remained his principal residence until 2003.[282] Highgrove House in Gloucestershire is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, having been purchased for Charles's use in 1980, and which he rented for \u00a3336,000 per annum.[283][284] Since William became the Duke of Cornwall, Charles is expected to pay \u00a3700,000 per annum for use of the property.[285] Charles also owns a property near the village of Viscri in Romania.[286][287]\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles's primary source of income was generated from the Duchy of Cornwall, which owns 133,658 acres of land (around 54,090 hectares), including farming, residential, and commercial properties, as well as an investment portfolio. Since 1993, Charles has paid tax voluntarily under the Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation, updated in 2013.[288]Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs were asked in December 2012 to investigate alleged tax avoidance by the Duchy of Cornwall.[289] The Duchy is named in the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment that were leaked to the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.[290][291]\nCharles has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is sovereign of many orders in his own countries and has received honours and awards from around the world.[293][294][295][296][297] In each of his realms, he has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: King of Saint Lucia and of His other Realms and Territories in Saint Lucia, King of Australia and His other Realms and Territories in Australia, etc. In the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency rather than a separate realm, he is known as Lord of Mann. Charles is also styled Defender of the Faith.\nThere had been speculation throughout Elizabeth II's reign as to what regnal name Charles would choose upon his accession; instead of Charles III, he could have chosen to reign as George VII or used one of his other given names.[298] It was reported that he might use George in honour of his grandfather George VI and to avoid associations with previous controversial kings named Charles.[note 8][299][300] Charles's office asserted in 2005 that no decision had yet been made.[301] Speculation continued for a few hours following his mother's death,[302] until Liz Truss announced and Clarence House confirmed that Charles would use the regnal name Charles III.[303][304]\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles's coat of arms was based on the arms of the United Kingdom, differenced with a white label and an inescutcheon of the Principality of Wales, surmounted by the heir apparent's crown, and with the motto Ich dien (German:[\u026a\u00e7\u02c8di\u02d0n], \"I serve\") instead of Dieu et mon droit.\nWhen Charles became king, he inherited the royal coats of arms of the United Kingdom and of Canada.[306] The design of his royal cypher, featuring a depiction of the Tudor crown instead of St Edward's Crown, was revealed on 27 September 2022. According to the College of Arms, the Tudor crown will now be used in representations of the royal arms of the United Kingdom and on uniforms and crown badges.[307]\nThe banners used by Charles as Prince of Wales varied depending upon location. His personal standard for the United Kingdom was the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom differenced as in his arms, with a label of three points argent and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre. It was used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when Charles was acting in an official capacity associated with the British Armed Forces.[308]\nThe personal flag for use in Wales was based upon the Royal Badge of Wales.[308] In Scotland, the personal banner used between 1974 and 2022 was based upon three ancient Scottish titles: Duke of Rothesay (heir apparent to the King of Scots), High Steward of Scotland, and Lord of the Isles. In Cornwall, the banner was the arms of the Duke of Cornwall.[308]\nThe royal standard of the United Kingdom is used to represent the King in the United Kingdom and on official visits overseas, except in Canada. It is the royal arms in banner form undifferentiated, having been used by successive British monarchs since 1702. The royal standard of Canada is used by the King in Canada and while acting on behalf of Canada overseas. It is the escutcheon of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada in banner form undifferentiated.\n^\"Prince Charles dined with Bin Laden's brother\". The Guardian. 13 October 2001.

He was amazing \u2013 it wasn't just how he scored the goals but what he did for the team.\"\nLewandowski was born in Warsaw[10] and grew up in Leszno, Warsaw West County.[11] He took his first steps in football as an unregistered player for the local club, Partyzant Leszno.[12] In 1997, he joined MKS Varsovia Warsaw, where as a teen he played for seven years.[13] The following year he moved to 4th tier side Delta Warsaw, where he finally managed to play in the first team, scoring four goals at the end of the season.[14]\nFollowing press speculation that Lewandowski might move to one of a number of clubs,[21][22] he joined Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund in June 2010, signing a four-year contract with the German club[23] for a fee reported to be worth around \u20ac4.5 million.[24] On 19 September, he scored his first goal in the Bundesliga to make it 3\u20130 in the Revierderby against Schalke 04; the game ended 3\u20131.[25]\nFollowing the winter break, on 22 January 2012, Dortmund thrashed Hamburg 5\u20131 to move level on points with leaders Bayern Munich; Lewandowski netted twice and added an assist for Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski in the rout.[33] He scored in a 1\u20130 home win over Bayern Munich on 11 April.[34] The result gave Dortmund a six-point cushion over their title rivals with only four games left to play.[35] On 21 April, Lewandowski provided the assist for Shinji Kagawa's 59th-minute goal as Dortmund won 2\u20130 over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach to seal their second straight title.[36] In the final Bundesliga game of the campaign, Lewandowski scored two first-half goals as Dortmund beat Freiburg 4\u20130 and celebrated lifting the title.[37]\nLewandowski finished the year as the third top goal scorer with 22 goals, none from the penalty spot, and six assists.[38]\nHe netted his first goal in a 3\u20130 victory over Bayer Leverkusen on 15 September 2012, extending Dortmund's run to 31 games unbeaten and moved the club into third in the Bundesliga.[44] Three days later, in the club's first Champions League game of the season, Lewandowski scored an 87th-minute winner to defeat Ajax, 1\u20130.[45] He set club's new record of the longest scoring streak, having scored in 12 consecutive league games, surpassing Friedhelm Konietzka's record from 1964\u201365 season.[46] On 9 February 2013, he opened the scoring in a home match against Hamburg, but was sent off in the 31st minute for a foul on Per Ciljan Skjelbred and Dortmund lost 4\u20131.[citation needed]\nAccording to Borussia Dortmund director Michael Zorc, speaking in February 2013, Lewandowski would not be renewing his contract with the club, and would leave either in the summer of 2013 or after the 2013\u201314 season.[47] He finished season with 24 league goals, one goal short of the Bundesliga's top scorer, Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kie\u00dfling.[citation needed]\nOn 27 July 2013, Lewandowski won the 2013 DFL-Supercup with Dortmund, 4\u20132, against Bayern Munich.[52] He scored his first goal of the season in Dortmund's 4\u20130 win over Augsburg in the club's opening Bundesliga match on 10 August.[53] On 1 November, he scored his only hat-trick of the season in a 6\u20131 Bundesliga win against VfB Stuttgart.[54]\nLewandowski ended the 2013\u201314 season as the top goalscorer in the Bundesliga with 20 goals, which earned him the Torj\u00e4gerkanone [de].[57] He also scored six goals in the Champions League, as Dortmund reached the quarter-finals.[58] During the second leg of the round of 16 match between Borussia Dortmund and Zenit, Lewandowski received a second yellow card, which resulted in his suspension for the first leg of the quarter-final against Real Madrid.[citation needed]\nLewandowski played his final match for Dortmund in the 2014 DFB-Pokal Final against Bayern Munich on 17 May. Head coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp had excused him from some training ahead of the final due to injury concerns; although Lewandowski played all 120 minutes of the final, Dortmund lost, 0\u20132.[59] He finished the season with 28 goals in 48 matches.[52][60]\nIn November 2013, Lewandowski confirmed he would sign a pre-contractual agreement for Borussia Dortmund's rivals Bayern Munich,[61] which officially happened on 3 January 2014, when he signed a five-year contract beginning at the start of the 2014\u201315 season.[62] Lewandowski was officially presented as a Bayern Munich player on 9 July 2014.[63]\nHe made his competitive debut for his new club in a 0\u20132 loss to Borussia Dortmund in the 2014 DFL-Supercup on 13 August 2014,[67] and scored his first goal in a 1\u20131 draw against Schalke 04 in his second league match on 30 August.[68] On 21 October, Lewandowski scored his first Champions League goal for Bayern Munich in a 7\u20131 away win against Roma.[69] On 1 November, in his first league match against Dortmund, Lewandowski scored in a 2\u20131 win which put Bayern four points clear at the top of the table while leaving his former club in a relegation play-off place.[70] In his third match of the season against Dortmund on 4 April 2015, Lewandowski scored in the 36th minute in a 1\u20130 win, after Dortmund's goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller \"parried\" Thomas M\u00fcller's shot.[71][72]\nOn 21 February 2015, Lewandowski scored twice in Bayern's 6\u20130 win away at Paderborn, his second goal of the game was his 10th of the league season.[73] He scored twice in the first half on 21 April as Bayern overturned a deficit from the first leg to defeat Porto 7\u20134 on aggregate and advance to the semi-finals of the Champions League.[74] Five days later, after VfL Wolfsburg lost to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Bayern won the Bundesliga title.[75] He scored again on 28 April, opening a 1\u20131 draw in the DFB-Pokal semi-final against Dortmund, but was later involved in a mid-air collision with Mitchell Langerak in the 116th minute of extra time.[76] The game ended in Bayern's elimination via a penalty shoot-out (0\u20132), and, unusually, none of the four attempts were converted by the Munich side, at their own stadium.[77][78] Although Lewandowski stayed until the end of the match, he didn't participate in the shootout; and tests later confirmed that he had fractured jaw and nose bone, and had a concussion, ruling him out for approximately one week.[79][80][81] On 12 May, playing in a protective mask, he curled in at the 59th minute in his team's 3\u20132 home victory against eventual winners Barcelona in the Champions League semifinal second leg, albeit they were eliminated by an aggregate score of 3\u20135.[82] With 17 goals in 31 games, Lewandowski was joint-second highest scorer of the Bundesliga season alongside teammate Arjen Robben, behind Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier.[83] He finished the season with 25 goals in 49 appearances.[67][84]\nOn 22 September 2015, Lewandowski set a Bundesliga record by coming on as a substitute with Bayern trailing 0\u20131 to Wolfsburg and scoring five goals in 8 minutes and 59 seconds, the fastest by any player in Bundesliga history, to take a 5\u20131 lead. He also set Bundesliga records for the fastest hat-trick (three goals in four minutes), and most goals scored by a substitute (five).[88] Lewandowski's five goals in nine minutes was also the fastest in any major European football league since Opta began keeping records, and it ended Wolfsburg's 14-match unbeaten run.[89] He was awarded four certificates by Guinness World Records for this feat.[90]\nFour days later, he scored twice in a 3\u20130 win at Mainz, the first goal being his 100th Bundesliga goal on his 168th appearance, a league record for a foreign player. He also reached 10 goals in the opening 7 matches with this brace, a feat only achieved before by Gerd M\u00fcller.[91] On 29 September, he scored a Champions League hat-trick in a 5\u20130 win over Dinamo Zagreb, putting him on ten goals in three games in a week.[92] He added two in a 5\u20131 rout of Dortmund five days later, to total 12 goals in his last four appearances.[93] On 24 October, Lewandowski scored in a 4\u20130 home win over 1. FC K\u00f6ln, a result which made Bayern the first Bundesliga team ever to win all 10 of their opening games of a season.[94] The victory in Cologne was also Bayern's 1,000th win in the Bundesliga.[95] On 11 January 2016, he achieved fourth place at the 2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or awards.[96]\nOn 19 March 2016, Lewandowski scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win against K\u00f6ln to bring his league total up to 25 goals; a new personal best.[97] He had scored 24 goals for Borussia Dortmund during the 2012\u201313 season.[98] He also started Bayern's comeback with a 73rd-minute header in the second leg of the round of 16 on 16 March, after trailing 0\u20132 home to Juventus, which Munich eventually won 4\u20132 after extra time, and 6\u20134 on aggregate.[99] His goal against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on 3 May in the second leg of Bayern's Champions League semifinal exit saw him end the season's competition with nine goals.[100]\nOn 7 May 2016, Lewandowski scored both goals for Bayern in a 2\u20131 win at Ingolstadt to confirm the Bavarian club as champions of Germany for the fourth consecutive season.[101] A week later, he scored his 30th goal of the season in Bayern's final league match of the season at home to Hannover 96. This made him the first foreign player to score 30 goals in the Bundesliga, the first player since Dieter M\u00fcller in 1976\u201377, and secured him the Torj\u00e4gerkanone for the second time in three seasons.[102] He finished the season with 42 goals in 51 matches.[85][103]\nOn 11 March 2017, Lewandowski reached 100 goals for Bayern in his 137th appearance for the club, scoring twice in a 3\u20130 victory against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.[109] He finished the season with 42 goals in 47 matches.[104][110]\nThe season began with Bayern Munich winning the 2017 DFL-Supercup against Borussia Dortmund, in which Lewandowski scored the opening goal for the Bavarians by controlling a low cross from Joshua Kimmich to cancel out Christian Pulisic's opener. The match ended 2\u20132 after extra time. Lewandowski, again, scored the first penalty of the shootout as Bayern eventually won 5\u20134.[111]\nLewandowski started from where he left in the last season and once again was the top scorer in the early stages of the 2017\u201318 Bundesliga. On 13 December, in the league fixture against K\u00f6ln, he scored the only goal of the game, to reach Bundesliga's top ten goalscorers of all time.[112] A couple of months later, on Matchday 22, Lewandowski again found the back of the net against Schalke 04 at the Allianz Arena to equal the record of scoring in 11 successive home games in a single season, a record also held by then Bayern manager Jupp Heynckes.[113] He continued his goal scoring form by netting a hat-trick against Hamburg as the runaway leaders won 6\u20130, while he also missed a kick from the spot which would have been his fourth goal of the day. This was his first penalty missed for Bayern in the Bundesliga, nevertheless he scored the second spot kick to complete his hat-trick.[114]\nOn 11 February 2018, he was voted Poland's Footballer of the Year for the seventh time in a row.[115] On 22 February, he fired his long-time agent, Cezary Kucharski. Lewandowski hired renowned dealmaker Pini Zahavi as his new agent; the hiring of Zahavi was rumoured to be the start of Lewandowski trying to seal a summer move to Real Madrid.[116] On 24 February, he played his 250th Bundesliga game against Hertha BSC.[117] On 19 May, Lewandowski scored Bayern's only goal in a 3\u20131 defeat in the DFB-Pokal Final against Eintracht Frankfurt.[118]\nLewandowski finished the league as the Bundesliga's top goalscorer with 29 goals. This was the third time he won the Torj\u00e4gerkanone award.[119] He finished the season with 41 goals in 48 matches in all competitions.[120]\nOn 1 August, after a summer of transfer speculation, Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, confirmed in an interview that Lewandowski would not be allowed to leave Bayern at any price, saying \"the top quality we have at Bayern Munich will stay here. With Robert, we clearly want to send a signal to people within and outside the club: Bayern Munich are completely different to other clubs who get weak when certain sums are mentioned\"[121] On 12 August, Lewandowski recorded the first ever hat-trick in the DFL-Supercup in a 0\u20135 away victory against Eintracht Frankfurt in the 2018 edition as Bayern Munich went on to win the title for the record seventh time.[122] He also became the all-time top scorer in the German Supercup history.[123][124]\nOn 27 November, Lewandowski became the third-fastest player to score 50 goals (after Lionel Messi and Ruud van Nistelrooy) in the Champions League, when he scored two goals in a 5\u20131 group stage home win over Benfica. It took Lewandowski just 77 Champions League matches to reach the milestone.[125] He finished as the top scorer in the Champions League group stage with eight goals in six matches.[126] On 9 February 2019, Lewandowski scored in a 3\u20131 win over Schalke 04 and became the first player to score 100 competitive goals at the Allianz Arena. His goal was also his 119th league goal for Bayern Munich, which saw him draw level with Roland Wohlfarth as the club's third-highest goalscorer of all-time.[127]\nHe surpassed Wohlfarth the following month after scoring a brace in a 5\u20131 win over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, with his second goal also seeing him equal Claudio Pizarro's record of 195 league goals for the most Bundesliga goals by a foreign player.[128][129] In his very next fixture, he broke Pizarro's record by scoring twice in a 6\u20130 win over Wolfsburg.[130] On 6 April, in the 100th Bundesliga meeting between Bayern Munich and Dortmund, Lewandowski scored twice in a 5\u20130 win, with his first goal taking him to 200 goals in the league.[131][132]\nLewandowski ended the league campaign as the Bundesliga's top goalscorer with 22 goals for the fourth time.[133] On 25 May, he scored a brace as Bayern won against Leipzig 3\u20130 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final. With his goals, he became the all-time top scorer in the DFB-Pokal finals with six, surpassing Gerd M\u00fcller on five.[134] Lewandowski finished the season with 40 goals in 47 matches in all competitions, reaching the 40-goal landmark for the fourth consecutive season, also winning his second domestic double with Bayern.[135]\nOn 12 August, Lewandowski scored his first goal of the season when Bayern defeated Energie Cottbus 3\u20131 in the first round of the DFB-Pokal.[136] Four days later, he scored two goals in the 2019\u201320 Bundesliga opener against Hertha BSC. With his goals, Lewandowski set a Bundesliga record for scoring a goal in the season opener for the fifth year in a row.[137] He then scored a hat-trick against Schalke at the Veltins Arena on 24 August, as the Reds won 3\u20130.[138] On 29 August, Lewandowski extended his contract at Bayern until 2023.[139] Lewandowski scored his 200th goal for Bayern in a 3\u20130 win against Serbian club Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on 18 September.[140] Later that month, after scoring his tenth goal of the campaign during a 3\u20132 win over Paderborn 07, he became the first player in Bundesliga history to achieve double figures for goals scored after the first six match rounds.[141] Lewandowski then became the first player in Bundesliga history to score in each of the opening nine, ten and eleven matches of a season, surpassing the record of eight set by former Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.[142][143][144] On 26 November, Lewandowski scored 4 goals in under 15 minutes as Bayern defeated Red Star Belgrade 6\u20130 in their reverse fixture and clinched first place in their Champions League group, setting a new record for fastest time to score four goals in a Champions League match.

The match was preceded by a moment of silence for Gerd M\u00fcller, who died two days earlier.[176] On 28 August, he scored his 15th Bundesliga hat-trick in a 5\u20130 win over Hertha BSC,[177] setting a new club and German record for the most consecutive appearances in all competitions with a goal at 16,[178] surpassing the previous record of 15 held by Gerd M\u00fcller from 1969 to 1970.[179] In addition, he managed to reach more than 300 goals with Bayern Munich in all competitions.[180] On 18 September, Lewandowski scored in his 13th consecutive Bundesliga home match against VfL Bochum, surpassing the previous league record of 12 held by Gerd M\u00fcller (October 1969 to April 1970) and Jupp Heynckes (June 1972 to February 1973).[181]\n\"You deserve your Ballon d'Or. Last year everyone agreed that you were the winner. Hopefully France Football can give it to you to have in your home, because you were the true winner if it weren't for the pandemic. You should have one in your house too.\"\nOn 15 January 2022, Lewandowski scored his 16th hat-trick and 300th Bundesliga goal in a 4\u20130 away win over 1. FC K\u00f6ln.[186] On 8 March, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 7\u20131 win over Red Bull Salzburg in the second leg of Champions League round of 16. Coming inside the first 23 minutes of the match, Lewandowski's hat-trick becomes the earliest ever scored by a player from the start of a Champions League match. Taking just 11 minutes from first goal to last, Lewandowski's three-goal extravaganza against Salzburg also ranks as the quickest hat-trick ever scored in the knockout phases of the Champions League. With these goals he took himself beyond the 40-goal mark in all competitions for the seventh consecutive season.[187] However, Lewandowski finished the league with 35 goals as top scorer for the fifth consecutive season and seventh outright, equaling the record of Gerd M\u00fcller. He also broke the Bundesliga record for most away goals in a single season with 19 goals.[188] In addition, he won his second European Golden Shoe award for the second consecutive season.[189]\nOn 30 May 2022, Lewandowski stated his desire to leave Bayern Munich, saying \"My story with Bayern has come to an end, I cannot imagine further good cooperation... I hope they will not stop me (from leaving) just because they can. A transfer is the best solution for everyone.\"[190]\nAt Bayern Munich, Lewandowski established himself as one of the best players of his generation. On 16 July 2022, Barcelona confirmed they had reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for Lewandowski's transfer.[191] Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of \u20ac45 million, potentially rising to \u20ac50 million with add-ons.[192] The contract included a release clause set at \u20ac500 million.[193] Lewandowski became the most expensive Polish player in history and Bayern Munich's most expensive sale of all time.[194] Lewandowski was formally unveiled in front of 50,000 fans on 5 August at the Camp Nou, and was handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Memphis Depay, and was officially registered on 12 August, amid speculation that the club could not register him as they were over the league's salary cap limit, due to their financial difficulties.[195][196][197][198]\nOn 7 August 2022, he scored his first ever goal for Barcelona in a 6\u20130 victory over Mexican club UNAM in the Joan Gamper Trophy pre-season match held at the Camp Nou.[199] On 13 August, he made his competitive debut for the club in 0\u20130 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league.[200] On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goals for Blaugrana, netting a brace in a 4\u20131 victory over Real Sociedad on 21 August,[201] followed by another brace against Real Valladolid in a 4\u20130 victory on 28 August.[202] On 7 September, in his first game as a Barcelona player in Champions League, he scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 victory over Viktoria Plze\u0148, becoming the first player in history to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different clubs.[203][204] On 11 September, he scored his sixth league goal of the season in his sixth league match for Barcelona, in their 4\u20130 win over C\u00e1diz, breaking Cristiano Ronaldo's record of scoring five goals in five consecutive league games in La Liga,[205] and eventually registered eleven goal contributions including nine goals and two assists in seven matches, after scoring the only goal of an away win over Mallorca on 1 October.[206]\nOn 12 October, Lewandowski scored a brace in Barcelona's Champions League fixture against Inter Milan, with his last minute equalizer securing a 3\u20133 home draw for the Blaugrana at Camp Nou.[207] Despite scoring five goals in the competition, his goals were not able to help Barcelona, as they finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa Leagueknockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season.[208] On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David Garc\u00eda, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2\u20131 against Osasuna.[209][210] However, Lewandowski participated in the 1\u20131 tie against rivalsEspanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain's sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Girona and Getafe.[211]\nOn 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3\u20131 in El Cl\u00e1sico, winning his first title with the club.[212] On 14 May, he scored two goals as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4\u20132, confirming them as La Liga champions.[213][214] By the end of the 2022\u201323 La Liga season, Lewandowski won his first Pichichi Trophy with 23 goals in 34 matches[215] becoming the first player in top 5 European leagues to get top scorer award in six consecutive seasons.\nOn 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5\u20130 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023\u201324 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.[216][217] On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3\u20132 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century surpassing the record previoulsly held by Samuel Eto'o.[218]\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2\u20130 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.[220][221] Only W\u0142odzimierz Luba\u0144ski scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10\u20130 victory.[222]\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski and was named Man of the Match.[223] He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.[224][225]\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-\u00c9tienne.[234] Following the 1\u20131 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time.[235] In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1\u20131 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost.[236] At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.[236]\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by W\u0142odzimierz Luba\u0144ski to become the all-time top scorer for Poland.[237][238] On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4\u20132 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland.[239] He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.[239]\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1\u20131 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships.[242][243] On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2\u20133 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.[244]\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty;[245] however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2\u20130, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination.[246] He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3\u20131 loss to France in the round of 16.[247]\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world,[248][249][250][251] and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time.[252] An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed Lewangoalski.[253] A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet.[254] Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions; despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker.\nHe has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. Lewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.[255][256][257][258][259]\nLewandowski in 2010\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer.[257] Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005),[260] was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division.[261] His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno.[261] His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.[261]\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies.[266][267][268] In the same year, he bought a luxury apartment in Z\u0142ota 44 in Warsaw.[269]\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.[270][271]\nLewandowski and his wife, Anna, have supported, donated and raised money for various charitable organisations and for children throughout their career, including Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, for which they've raised more than PLN 150,000 during Anna's birthday party on 25 August 2018.[283] Lewandowski also donated PLN 100,000 for the treatment of Cyprian Gawe\u0142, a three-year-old boy from Hel;[284] and helps raising funds for the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity each year, donating his personal items or private meetings that are sold at online auctions.[285][286][287]\nIn March 2014, he was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[288] In June the same year, he visited a refugee camp in Zaatari, Jordan, and took part in the \"Voice of the Children\" campaign in which he appealed for support of children affected by humanitarian crises.[289]\nIn 2018, he and his wife donated PLN 500,000 to Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw.[290]\nIn January 2022, he won a charity auction in which he paid PLN 280,000 for Dawid Tomala's Olympic gold medal. The funds were used to finance the operation of a seriously ill boy.[292] Lewandowski subsequently returned the medal to Tomala.[293]\nIn February 2022, Lewandowski condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and showed his solidarity with the Ukrainian people by wearing a blue and yellow armband during a Bundesliga match.[294] The armband was later auctioned for PLN 27,000 and the money was used to purchase humanitarian aid for Ukraine.[295]\nBeside philanthropy, Lewandowski also invests primarily in startups, e-commerce, and websites, mainly through Protos Venture Capital, a company of which he is a shareholder.[296] He also owns Stor9_, an agency specialising in marketing communications.[297] In 2022, Lewandowski and his wife Anna's net worth was estimated at PLN 625 million (US$ 140 million), making them claim the 89th place on the \"List of 100 Richest Poles\" compiled by the Wprost magazine.[298]\nIn 2016, a mobile game Lewandowski: Euro Star 2016 was released on Android and iOS platforms.[307]\nIn March 2022, Lewandowski cancelled his sponsorship deal with Chinese telecom company Huawei after the company's reported support to Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lewandowski had signed on as the global ambassador for Huawei, after agreeing to a partnership in November 2015.[308][309]",

        "context": "\nBusiness magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 27, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company's workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. In June 2023, the Twitter service was rebranded as X.\nReactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk's planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation, disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform. Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk's intentions. Since becoming owner, Musk has faced backlash for his handling of the company and account suspensions.[1][2][3]\nBusiness magnate Elon Musk published his first tweet on his personal Twitter account in June 2010,[4] and had more than 80 million followers by April 2022.[5] In 2017, in response to a tweet suggesting that he buy Twitter, Inc., Musk replied, \"How much is it?\"[6] On March 24, 2022, Musk began tweeting criticisms of Twitter,[7] polling his followers on whether the company adhered to the principle that \"free speech is essential to a functioning democracy\".[8] Days later, he discussed the future of social media with Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey and explored the possibility of joining Twitter's board of directors with private equity firmSilver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban. He relayed this idea to Twitter board chairBret Taylor and CEO Parag Agrawal, proposing to either take the company private or start a rival social media platform.[9] Dorsey responded to Musk with a text message, saying he hoped Twitter could become open-sourced and that he had unsuccessfully pushed for Musk's induction into Twitter's board a year earlier, a move that had prompted his departure from his role as CEO.[10]\nMusk began purchasing Twitter stock on January 31, 2022.[7] On April 4, he announced that he had acquired 9.2 percent of the company's shares totaling $2.64 billion,[11] making him the company's largest shareholder.[12] Following the announcement, Twitter's stock experienced its largest intraday surge since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 2013, rising by as much as 27 percent.[13] The next day, Twitter invited Musk to join the company's board,[14] which Musk accepted.[15] This had been recommended to the board by Twitter's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee three days earlier, with some board members expressing concern about potential \"adverse impacts on stockholder value\".[9] The position would have prohibited Musk from going beyond a 14.9 percent ownership stake and limited his ability to speak publicly about the company.[16][9] That day, Musk phoned Dorsey, who declined Musk's suggestion for him to remain on the board.[9]\nOn April 11, after publishing several tweets critical of the company, Musk announced he had decided not to join the board.[17] Instead, he informed Twitter that he intended to make an offer to take the company private. On April 12, Twitter's board met with lawyers and financial advisors to deliberate the ramifications of such a deal as well as their options,[9] while company shareholder Marc Bain Rasella sued Musk for allegedly manipulating the company's stock price and violating Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.[18]\nOn April 14, Musk made an unsolicited and non-binding offer to Twitter to purchase the company for $43 billion, or $54.20 per share, and take it private.[20] Though the offer was made to company management, the bid was described as a hostile takeover attempt because of the implied threat to purchase the outstanding stock if management declined.[21][22] The board responded that it would \"carefully review the proposal\".[23] After making the offer, Musk spent the night playing the video game Elden Ring to alleviate his stress.[24]\nIn a TED interview, Musk said he aimed to make Twitter a \"platform for free speech around the globe\", hailing free speech a \"societal imperative for a functioning democracy\" and insisting that he had not made the offer to increase his wealth.[25][26] Critics noted that he showed more interest in altering Twitter's moderation policies than in fighting government censorship.[27] According to The Washington Post, the banning of accounts such as The Babylon Bee had prompted Musk to initiate the acquisition.[28] The price of $54.20 per share is believed to be a reference to 420, a slang term in cannabis culture for marijuana consumption.[29]\nOn April 15, Twitter's board of directors announced a \"poison pill\" strategy which would allow shareholders to purchase additional stock in the event of a hostile takeover; the plan expired on April 14, 2023.[30] On April 17, Taylor was urged by Twitter's largest institutional shareholders to \"seriously consider\" the offer.[9] On April 20, Musk disclosed that he had secured financing provided by a group of banks led by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, MUFG, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Mizuho Bank, and BNP Paribas, for a potential tender offer to acquire the company.[31][32] The funding included $7 billion of senior secured bank loans; $6 billion in subordinated debt; $6.25 billion in bank loans to Musk personally, secured by $62.5 billion of his Tesla stock; $20 billion in cash equity from Musk, to be provided by sales of Tesla stock and other assets; and $7.1 billion in equity from 19 independent investors.[33][34][35]\nThe initially proposed $13 billion in money borrowed by Twitter was equivalent to seven times the company's 2022 projected operating cash flow; some banks found that multiple too risky and opted to participate only in the $12.5 billion margin loan to Musk.[36] The debt was estimated to cost Twitter approximately $1 billion in annual interest and fees.[31] Two days after announcing his bid, Musk registered three holding companies under the name \"X Holdings\" in preparation for his takeover.[37] Tesla shares fell 12 percent on the day after the acquisition was announced, amid smaller declines in the broader markets. Musk incurred a $21 billion paper loss that day.[38]\nOn April 23, Musk informed Taylor that his offer was \"best and final\", urging him to accept in a letter sent the following day.[9] Multiple outlets subsequently reported that Twitter was in final negotiations to accept Musk's offer, with a deal expected to be reached by the next day,[39][40][41] though Reuters cautioned that the deal could still fall apart.[42] On April 25, Twitter shares rose by 5 percent following reports that Twitter was poised to accept Musk's offer.[43] Twitter advisors Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase approved of the deal, deeming it fair from a financial perspective.[9] Twitter's board publicly and unanimously accepted the buyout offer for $44 billion, and Twitter was to become a private company once the transaction was completed sometime in 2022.[44][45] Negotiations with Musk were led by the board's transaction committee, composed of Taylor, Martha Lane Fox, and Patrick Pichette.[46] The deal would require shareholder and regulatory approval before it could be finalized,[47] though analysts believed it was unlikely to be challenged by regulators.[48]\nMusk was barred from disparaging the company or its employees when tweeting about the acquisition before the transaction closed.[49] The agreement also stipulated that if Musk failed to close the acquisition, he would be required to pay Twitter a $1 billion breakup fee.[50][51] Agrawal was set to receive $39 million from the buyout, while Dorsey would receive $978 million.[52] Musk had privately selected a new CEO to replace Agrawal upon completion of the acquisition,[36] though he was expected to serve as interim CEO in the months after its completion.[53] Tesla's stock sank by more than $125 billion the next market day, causing Musk to lose about $30 billion of his net worth.[54][55] Within three days after Twitter agreed to be acquired, Musk had sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla shares.[56]\nAfter the acceptance was announced, Musk said that his first goal would be to make the algorithm that ranks tweets in the content feed open-sourced, in an effort to increase transparency. He has also stated that he intended to remove spambots and \"authenticate all real humans\",[57] suggesting that he might convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter.[58][59] Musk said he lacked confidence in Twitter's corporate management,[60] telling banks that he had considered reducing executive and board pay.[36] He published tweets critical of decisions made by Twitter executives such as Vijaya Gadde,[61] who was subsequently harassed by Twitter users using racist and sexist language.[62][63] On April 28, Twitter told advertising agencies that their work would not be seen next to offensive material.[64] Musk also discussed with bankers with the ideas of cutting jobs and costs, encouraging influencers to be creative, and adding subscription services to Twitter.[65][66]\nOn May 13, Musk revealed that he had placed the deal \"on hold\" in the wake of reports that 5 percent of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts,[73] causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.[74] Musk clarified that he remained committed to the acquisition,[75] and Agrawal stated he expected the deal to close.[76] In response to a May 16 Twitter thread in which Agrawal said an external review into the platform's users was impractical, Musk tweeted out a poop emoji.[77] The following day, Musk reiterated that the acquisition could not \"move forward\" until Twitter could prove the aforementioned reports false,[78][79] urging the SEC to investigate Twitter's daily user numbers.[80] The same day, Twitter filed new documents with the SEC, including a detailed timeline of Musk's purchase,[9] and affirmed they would \"enforce the merger agreement\" regardless of Musk's actions.[81] On May 25, Musk abandoned plans to partially fund the deal through margin loans against Tesla stock, instead opting to pledge an additional $6.25 billion in equity financing.[82][83] Dorsey departed Twitter's board the same day,[84] while Twitter investor William Heresniak filed a class-action lawsuit against Musk, alleging that he had violated corporate laws in California by manipulating the market.[85] The lawsuit further declared that Musk was not permitted by the acquisition contract to place the deal on hold, and that Musk's misleading statements had contributed to declining Twitter stock prices.[86][87]\nFormer Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko claimed that the company had misled the public on its privacy and security woes.\nOn June 3, the acquisition was cleared by U.S. antitrust review.[88] In an email sent by Musk's attorney to Twitter three days later, Musk threatened to terminate his agreement with Twitter because the company had refused to give him data pertaining to its users.[89][90] Twitter responded that they would continue to cooperate with Musk to ensure that the transaction was closed in accordance with their agreement.[91] On June 8, Twitter's board complied with Musk's demands, agreeing to provide him with a \"firehose\" data stream of tweets.[92][93] A week later, the SEC asked Agrawal to provide information on how Twitter estimated its number of spam accounts, to which the company obliged; the SEC concluded its inquiry on July 27.[94][95] Musk attended an all-hands meeting on June 16 to answer questions from Twitter employees,[96] discussing Twitter's content moderation policy, freedom of speech, potential layoffs, remote work, and \"the cosmic nature of Twitter\".[97][98][99] Musk also expressed his desire for Twitter to reach one billion active users,[100] and pledged his commitment to advertising as a source of revenue for Twitter.[101]\nIn a complaint filed by Whistleblower Aid with the SEC, U.S. Justice Department, and FTC on July 6, former Twitter security officer Peiter Zatko accused several Twitter executives, including Agrawal and certain board members, of making false or misleading statements about privacy, security, and content moderation on the platform in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and SEC disclosure rules. These included misrepresentations to Musk made during the course of the acquisition bid, with the complaint specifically calling Agrawal's May 16 thread deceptive.[102][103][104] In a July 7 conference call, Twitter revealed that over one million spam accounts were removed daily, and reiterated that it was impossible to externally determine the exact number of these accounts as it would involve private user data.[105] That same day, The Washington Post reported that the deal was \"in peril\" amid a slowdown in discussions on funding.[106]\nTwitter formally launched its lawsuit against Musk at the Delaware Court of Chancery on July 12,[114] with Musk tweeting in response, \"Oh the irony lol\".[115] Twitter requested that the trial be held from September 19 through September 22,[116] before the deal's originally scheduled \"drop dead\" date on October 24.[117] Musk's legal team objected to this, asking for the trial to be held from February 13 through February 22, 2023.[118] On July 19, judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the trial would last for five days in October,[119][120] with Twitter seeking an October 10 start date.[121] During its quarterly earnings investor call on July 22, Twitter cited the \"chaos\" caused by the proposal as the primary factor for its decline in revenue.[122] In a letter to McCormick on July 26, Musk's lawyers complained that Twitter had hindered them from commencing the discovery process and requested an October 17 start date,[121] which McCormick granted three days later with a duration of five days.[123]\nIn a tweet on August 6, Musk challenged Agrawal to a public debate on Twitter's spambot accounts, before polling his followers on whether they believed that less than 5 percent of Twitter accounts were \"fake/spam\".[124] On August 10, Musk sold 7.92 million Tesla shares worth a total of $6.9 billion as backup should he lose the lawsuit, despite previously stating he would no longer sell Tesla stock.[125] The next week, McCormick ordered Twitter to produce documents from Beykpour, which Musk's team had requested along with files from 22 other Twitter employees and 41 \"custodians\".[126] Shortly thereafter, Musk subpoenaed Dorsey.[127] Other businessmen and investors subpoenaed include Marc Andreessen, Ellison, David Sacks, and Joe Lonsdale, while Twitter and Musk also subpoenaed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Salesforce, Mastercard, and more. Sacks and Lonsdale were both irritated that they were being subpoenaed, with the former filing a failed motion to dismiss the subpoena. In total, lawyers for Twitter issued over 84 subpoenas, while Musk's lawyers issued more than 36.[113]\nFacing increasing pressure from Musk, Twitter announced that it would combine its health team, tasked with preventing non-consensual nudity and child sexual exploitation on the platform, with its anti-spam team.[128] McCormick rejected much of Musk's team's \"absurdly broad\" request for data pertaining to all of Twitter's users, but ordered the company to produce data from 9,000 accounts it previously audit sampled.[129] Musk filed a \"termination letter\" with the SEC on August 29, citing Zatko's claims as evidence Twitter breached their contract,[130][131] before asking McCormick to delay the trial by a few weeks.[132] McCormick rejected the request,[133] and Musk's team sent a third termination letter to Twitter.[134] On September 13, Zatko testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee,[135][136][137] while Twitter shareholders voted in favor of the acquisition.[138][139] Musk privately offered to purchase Twitter at the reduced prices of $31 billion and $39.6 billion, both of which the company rejected.[140][141]\nOn October 3, Musk's legal team informed Twitter that Musk had changed his mind and decided to move forward with his proposed acquisition at the originally agreed-upon price of $54.20 per share, on the condition that Twitter drop its lawsuit.[142] The reason for this reversal was attributed to concerns from Musk's team that they would not be able to prove that there was a material adverse effect justifying a break from contract. Musk and Agrawal's depositions were originally scheduled for October 6 and 10, respectively.[143] Musk stated that his purchase of Twitter was part of his ambition to create an \"everything app\" called X, which would offer many different services.[144] In response, McCormick asked both sides to propose to her how they should proceed. Twitter shares surged by 23 percent as a result of Musk's announcement.[143] Neither Twitter nor Musk responded to McCormick's request, prompting her to announce that the trial would go forward as planned.[145]\nOn October 6, McCormick agreed to a request by Musk to postpone the trial to October 28 so Musk could finalize his debt financing for the acquisition, adding that the trial would be rescheduled to November if the deal did not close by then.[146][147] During this time, Musk deposited a $1 billion loan from his company SpaceX, paying back the loan with interest the following month.[148][149] On October 13, court filings revealed that Musk was being investigated by the U.S. government for his conduct in the proposed buyout.[150][151] Musk later stated that he believed Twitter's long-term value would exceed the price of $54.20 per share, which he considered an overpayment.[152] On October 20, The Washington Post reported that Musk intended to terminate 75 percent of Twitter's staff, and that Twitter executives were keen on selling the company to Musk so they could mitigate their planned payroll and infrastructure cuts.[153][154] In an open letter, Twitter employees condemned Musk's intentions and warned of negative consequences on the future of Twitter.[155][156]Bloomberg News and the Post further reported that officials in the Biden administration were considering a national security review of Musk's proposed acquisition and other ventures via the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS),[157][158] with the possibility of U.S. PresidentJoe Biden blocking the purchase if need be;[159] the White House denied the reports.[160][161]\nBy October 21, both parties' bankers and lawyers were set to complete the paperwork for the acquisition by the end of the month, with the deal expected to close by then.[162][163] The banks funding the acquisition were to hold the $13 billion worth of debt incurred as opposed to selling it.[164][165] In a video call with banks who helped Musk fund the acquisition, Musk assured them he would complete the buyout by the deadline.[166] Musk made a trip to Twitter's headquarters on October 26, tweeting a video of him carrying a kitchen sink at the site's lobby and changing his Twitter bio to \"Chief Twit\".[167][168][169] Musk also told Twitter employees that while layoffs were still likely to happen, he did not intend to do so at the scale the Post had previously reported.[170][171] The next day, Musk wrote in an open letter to advertisers that Twitter would not become a \"free-for-all hellscape\", reiterating that his motives for the purchase were not based on greed but rather a desire to create \"a common digital town square\".[172] He then asked Tesla engineers to meet with Twitter's product managers in order to assess the platform's codebase,[173] which was frozen until November 1.[174]\nIn the afternoon of October 27, Musk and Twitter closed the deal, with Musk tweeting \"the bird is freed\". Musk immediately became Twitter's new owner, promptly firing Agrawal, chief financial officer (CFO) Ned Segal, Gadde, and general counsel Sean Edgett,[175][176][177] with the executives escorted out of the company's headquarters by security.[178] This move came to the surprise of many involved, who had expected Musk to allow the executives to voluntarily resign; Agrawal had prepared a draft of his resignation letter before his access to his Twitter email account was cut off. According to Walter Isaacson's biography Elon Musk (2023), Musk \"meticulously\" changed his plans so \"he could terminate their employment before their stock options would vest\", seeking retribution for Agrawal's handling of the spambot incident.[179] Agrawal, Segal, and Gadde were set to receive \"golden parachute\" sums of $38.7 million, $25.4 million, and $12.5 million, respectively,[180][181] but The New York Times reported that Musk was unlikely to make the payments because the executives had been dismissed for cause.[182] According to the Financial Times, Musk's justification for this assertion was that the company had been mismanaged, and the executives were \"weighing their legal options over the decision\".[183] Dorsey retained his $1 billion ownership stake,[184][185] and several other executives departed Twitter in the ensuing days.[186][187][188]\nMusk assumed the position of CEO,[189][190] merging the company with X Holdings and dissolving Twitter's board of directors.[191] With this merger, Twitter ceased to be an independent company, with X Corp. later created in March 2023 to house the company.[192][193] Musk uses the title \"Chief Twit\" to refer to his position as CEO.[194] A \"war room\" was established at Twitter, with Musk meeting with Spiro, Sacks, and others to discuss his next steps.[195] According to The New York Times, the group's two primary objectives were to reduce the size of Twitter's workforce and overhaul the platform's mobile app.[196] Twitter employees were not formally informed of the change in management,[197] with Musk originally said to be planning a town hall meeting with employees but ultimately not doing so.[175][198] The next day, Twitter shares ceased trading in accordance with Musk's pledge to take the company private;[199][200][201] the company's stock ticker was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 8.[202]\nSince becoming owner, Musk has enacted a series of reforms, including overhauling Twitter's verification system by requiring new applicants to purchase a Twitter Blue subscription.[203] Many Twitter staff members were directed to extend their working hours in order to meet Musk's deadlines for his desired changes to the platform.[204] On November 4, Musk laid off roughly half of Twitter's workforce,[205][206] and two weeks later, he issued an ultimatum to employees to commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work in order to realize Musk's vision of \"Twitter 2.0\", or leave.[207][208] Hundreds of employees resigned in response.[209][210]\nMusk's acquisition of Twitter was principally responsible for the development of Threads, a social media platform which closely resembles Twitter, by rival company Meta Platforms. Work began on the service in November 2022, and it was released on July 5, 2023, amidst continued backlash to changes to Twitter enacted by Musk and Yaccarino.[227][228] In response, Twitter threatened to sue Meta over intellectual property infringement.[229] Agrawal, Segal, and Gadde filed a lawsuit against Twitter in April 2023, claiming that the company had failed to pay them for the legal fees they had incurred during their tenure.[230] McCormick ruled in the executives' favor in October.[231]\nIn June, X Corp. sued Wachtell to recoup a portion of the $90 million fee the law firm had paid, accusing the firm of \"unjust enrichment\" for charging a bonus fee on successful completion of the acquisition when the agreement with prior Twitter management stipulated billing only on an hourly basis.[232][233] The Twitter app was rebranded as X in July, an unprecedented decision which has created confusion among users.[234] In September, Musk failed to appear before the SEC in response to the agency's investigation into his purchasing of Twitter stock the year prior, prompting a lawsuit.[235]The Wall Street Journal reported in October 2023 that the seven major banks that had provided Musk's acquisition loans failed to follow the standard practice of quickly selling down their exposure to other banks due to a lack of appetite for the debt since Musk took over, instead expected to mark down the debt by at least 15 percent in order to sell it.[236]\nFollowing Musk's induction to Twitter's board of directors on April 5, Agrawal wrote that he believed Musk's appointment would bring long-term value to the company, while Dorsey wrote that Musk \"cares deeply about our world and Twitter's role in it\".[15] Dorsey privately relayed his appreciation to Musk for his commitment, texting that he trusted Musk.[10] On April 11, Agrawal stated that he believed Musk's withdrawal from the board was \"for the best\", noting that the company would \"remain open to his input\".[17]\nAgrawal applauded the purchase and assured employees that no layoffs were planned at that time,[247][248] adding he was proud of Twitter employees \"despite the noise\" around the company.[61] He also led an all-hands meeting on April 29 to address concerns raised by employees.[249] Dorsey endorsed the sale, saying that \"taking [Twitter] back from Wall Street is the correct first step\" and that he trusted Musk to be the owner of the company.[250] Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo denounced Musk's criticism of the company.[61] Gadde allegedly cried during a meeting about the announcement and was subjected to online trolling.[251] Musk's June 17 meeting with employees was generally negatively received by participants, who found Musk's statements \"incoherent\" and \"uninspiring\".[252] Musk was repeatedly derided and mocked by Twitter employees on their internal Slack channels after the deal was brokered.[143]\nEdgett instructed employees not to share commentary on the purported cancellation; nonetheless, several Twitter employees posted humorous messages making light of the situation.[275] Tesla shares rose 2.11 percent in the hours after Musk's announcement.[276] Trump criticized Musk and called the acquisition \"rotten\",[277] which led to a protracted feud between the two.[278][279] With the exception of Trump, most conservatives sided with Musk, with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon attacking Twitter for allegedly lying about the prevalence of its spambot accounts and Turning Point USA CEO Charlie Kirk musing that Musk may have been seeking to \"expose\" Twitter the whole time.[280] In an email sent to Twitter's employees in response to Zatko's complaint, Agrawal sharply rejected the claims and called them a \"false narrative\".[281]\nInternally, Twitter employees expressed concern that Musk would lay off employees before they receive their compensation payments,[181] among other messages criticizing Musk and voicing solidarity with each other.[287] Amid conflicting reports on whether Musk was planning sweeping layoffs, many employees expressed uncertainty and fear on Slack, Discord, and LinkedIn.[293][294] Women's rights activist Seyi Akiwowo tweeted her disappointment with Gadde's dismissal, while children's rights activist Beeban Kidron said that Musk's newfound power would not result in more free speech.[292] Podcaster Joe Rogan praised Musk for his aspirations,[289] while right-wing Twitter account Libs of TikTok rejoiced over the news of the purchase.[288] Media personality Stew Peters, who had been blocked from Twitter for months, attempted to circumvent the block after the purchase using a new account, which was later suspended.[287]Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Russian state-controlled RT broadcasting service, demanded that Musk lift her Twitter suspension.[198] Bin Talal Al Saud congratulated Musk on the purchase,[287] and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon urged Musk to eradicate spambot accounts.[295] Tesla rival General Motors announced it would temporarily stop paid advertising on Twitter.[291] Advertising agencies IPG Mediabrands and Omnicom Media Group recommended their clients temporarily pause advertising on Twitter due to safety and trust concerns over Musk's ownership.[296][297] A slew of companies proceeded to do so, including Audi, Bentley, the Carlsberg Group, General Mills, Lamborghini, Mondelez International, Porsche, Pfizer, REI, and the Volkswagen Group.[298][299]Media buying agency GroupM also advised its clients against procuring advertisements from Twitter.[300] Alt-tech social media platform Parler welcomed Musk's purchase, while alt-tech platform Gettr was more skeptical, believing Twitter was \"fundamentally broken\".[301] Similarities have been drawn between the acquisition and the 2022 film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, with some viewers comparing Musk to the character of Miles Bron, though director Rian Johnson stated that the similarities were purely coincidental.[302][303]\nOnline reception to Musk's completion of the purchase was mixed.[304] According to Memetica, a digital investigations company, several far-right figures experienced a significant increase in followers after the deal was finalized, while many progressives experienced a significant decrease, although it is unclear if Musk's takeover drove the changes in followers.[305] Mastodon once again experienced a surge in sign-ups.[306] Multiple celebrities in the entertainment industry announced their departure from the platform,[307][308] while some left-wing influencers such as John Pavlovitz and Rob Reiner urged fellow leftists to remain on Twitter for the time being.[307][305] The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) observed a 500 percent spike in the use of the racial slur \"nigger\" in the 12 hours after Musk completed the acquisition, while The Washington Post noted an increase in pro-Nazi, misogynistic, and anti-LGBTQ+ tweets.[198] Basketball player LeBron James expressed concern over the NCRI's report, condemning \"unfit people saying hate speech is free speech\".[309] Twitter responded by saying that the accounts using racial slurs were part of a \"trolling campaign\" and would be banned summarily.[310][311] The Center for Countering Digital Hate reported that anti-Black, anti-gay, and anti-transgender slurs had increased since Musk took control of Twitter, while the Anti-Defamation League reported an increase in antisemitic content.[312]\nAnticipating a takeover, Elizabeth Lopatto of The Verge predicted that it would lead to a mass employee exodus and a possible reinstatement of Trump's Twitter account.[313] After the acquisition announcement, Alex Werpin of The Hollywood Reporter warned of widespread repercussions.[314] Greg Bensinger of The New York Times argued that Musk's acquisition was \"about controlling a megaphone\" rather than free speech,[315] while Elizabeth Dwoskin of The Washington Post remarked that Musk's free speech vision for Twitter was considered by technologists to be outdated and impractical.[316] Don Pittis of CBC News noted the controversy associated with the wealthy gaining control of media platforms.[317]Brendan O'Neill of Spiked observed that Musk's purchase of Twitter and the resulting backlash represented a \"battle for control of the Internet\",[318] with Business Insider's Ben Gilbert calling the purchase the latest \"battleground\" in the culture war between Democrats and Republicans.[319]Michael Hiltzik of The Seattle Times commented that Musk's impact on Twitter would depend on his policies and how he chooses to implement them.[320]David Auerbach of UnHerd saw the purchase as indicative of a \"major flashpoint\" in the transition of society to \"a more decentralized, chaotic, and devolved world\".[321] Paul R. La Monica of CNN Business suggested that Tesla's declining stock price indicated that Wall Street investors were doubtful on whether Musk's purchase would go through.[322]CleanTechnica's Matt Pressman believed that Musk's purchase would benefit Tesla because owners of the company's cars often engaged on the platform,[323] and Lindsey Bakes of Deseret News wrote that Musk could integrate cryptocurrency within Twitter.[324]\nFelix Salmon of Axios noted that a clause in the contract opened the door for a judge to grant specific performance and order Musk to move forward with the deal.[352] CNBC's Jonathan Vanian described Musk's withdrawal as the product of months of buyer's remorse,[353] while his colleague Alex Sherman observed that paying the stipulated breakup fee would not relieve Musk of compensations or sanctions.[354] Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Holman W. Jenkins Jr. questioned whether Musk had proposed the acquisition \"out of mouth momentum or excessive enjoyment of the limelight or for some mysterious reason that causes an onlooker to throw up his hands\".[355] Various news publications believed that Zatko's complaint provided potential evidence in Musk's favor,[356][357][358] though Bloomberg News columnist Matt Levine argued that the complaint confirmed Twitter's monetizable daily active users counts do not include spambots.[359]\nConservative commentators celebrated the purchase's closure.[285][288][362]Fox News host Tucker Carlson argued that Musk's laissez-faire approach to moderation on Twitter would reshape American political discourse.[362] Shapiro wrote that he hoped other social media platforms would implement Musk's proposals and called on Musk to reverse Peterson's suspension from Twitter.[285][288][362] Political commentator Matt Walsh saw the purchase as an opportunity to rally opposition against the \"trans agenda\".[198][362] Political columnist Benny Johnson called on Musk to reverse the suspensions of several prominent conservatives.[285]Spiked's O'Neill claimed that liberals' negative reaction to the closure reflected their fear of freedom and liberty,[363] while Washington Examiner's Christopher Tremoglie disapproved of Musk's idea for a moderation council as continued censorship.[364]\nLauren Hirsch of The New York Times observed that Musk would face financial challenges in owning Twitter, including the company's difficulty in turning a profit.[365] Richard Waters of the Financial Times echoed Hirsch's sentiments, adding that it would difficult for Musk to allow the right amount of free speech on the platform.[366] Kate Ferguson of Deutsche Welle viewed Musk as unreliable and therefore unfit to operate Twitter,[367] and Hamilton Nolan of The Guardian felt the purchase was an attempt by Musk to \"control the conversation\".[368] Barbara Ortutay, Tom Krisher and Matt O'Brien of the Associated Press noted Musk's contradictory and vague messages in the past regarding his vision for Twitter,[369] while Ben Burgis of Jacobin criticized liberals' technocratic views and their downplaying of the importance of free speech in response to the purchase, though he remarked that Musk had a history of suppressing his critics.[370] Also writing for The New York Times, Kate Conger, Ryan Mac, and Tiffany Hsu noted that Musk's meetings with civil rights activists and his plans for a content moderation council were reminiscent of the actions taken by Zuckerberg following backlash on Facebook's handling of the 2016 U.S. elections.[371]Politico'sJack Shafer noted that media coverage of Musk's purchase foretold \"chaos, greater political oversight, and outright failure.\"[372]\nMedia Matters for America president Angela Carusone warned that Musk's leadership would lead to an increase in disinformation, conspiracy theories, and harassment on Twitter.[373] Literary group PEN America opined that the midterm elections in November would serve as a test as to whether Musk would allow disinformation to spread rapidly on the platform,[374] while American left-wing activist coalition Stop the Deal warned of real-world consequences if a rise in hate speech occurs on Twitter.[291][198] Over 40 civil rights groups signed an open letter to 20 Twitter advertisers urging them to abandon the platform if Musk lifts its content moderation measures.[186] Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the purchase, but expressed concerns over a potential rise in hate speech.[373]Fight for the Future director Evan Greer appreciated Musk's idea for a moderation council, but noted that Musk had supreme authority on any decisions made.[195]Eliot Higgins of Bellingcat believed that Musk's attempts to promote free speech would backfire under increased government regulation.[284] LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign voiced concern at Twitter's new ownership and argued that Twitter has the responsibility to stop its platform from turning into a \"dangerous media environment\".[198]\nOn the first anniversary of the acquisition, Musk valued the company at $19 billion, a 55 percent decrease from the buyout's $44 billion purchase price.[375][376]Fidelity, which contributed $300 million to the acquisition, depressed the value by 65 percent.[377] Statistics indicated a 30 percent decline in active users, 60 percent decline in advertising,[378] 14 percent decline in website traffic,[379] and 38 percent decline in app downloads.[380] The company has refuted these metrics, reporting an increase in engagement.[379] A nonfiction book about the acquisition, Breaking Twitter: Elon Musk and the Most Controversial Corporate Takeover in History, was announced by author Ben Mezrich in December 2022 and released in November 2023.[381][382]\nMany publications reflected on Twitter's first year under Musk's ownership. Journalists for The Washington Post, citing data from the University of Washington, wrote that the platform had \"become a cacophony of misinformation and confusing reports\", remarking on Twitter's stark shift toward conservatism.[383] Pranav Dixit of The Guardian lambasted the changes and reforms Musk had instituted in the past year,[384] while Miles Klee of Rolling Stone criticized Musk's alleged pandering to \"right-wing extremists and peddlers of misinformation\".[385]The Verge's Jay Peters pointed to Musk's radical changes and declining user numbers as evidence that the takeover was a \"disaster\",[386] while Bloomberg's Aisha Counts zeroed in on the increase in misinformation and hate speech.[387] Kate Conger of The New York Times and Alex Kirshner of Slate lamented that Musk's acquisition had fundamentally changed the meaning of Twitter.[388][389] Annika Burgess of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation declared, \"Twitter as the world knew it is dead\".[390] Musk has largely dismissed this negative commentary.[391][392][393]\n^Murphy, Hannah; McGee, Patrick; Fontanella-Khan, James; Indap, Sujeet (October 30, 2022). \"Elon Musk moves quickly to shake up Twitter with plans for job cuts\".

In this instance, Musk's argument is that Twitter has been mismanaged and that if it were not for his bid, the value of the company's stock would have collapsed, one of the people said. The executives, according to a person familiar with their thinking, are weighing their legal options over the decision. Denying severance payments related to acquisitions is unusual and the \"for cause\" clause typically requires misconduct to have taken place.",

        "context": "\nFirst extension of AlphaZero to mathematics unlocks new possibilities for research\nAlgorithms have helped mathematicians perform fundamental operations for thousands of years. The ancient Egyptians created an algorithm to multiply two numbers without requiring a multiplication table, and Greek mathematician Euclid described an algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor, which is still in use today.\nDuring the Islamic Golden Age, Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi designed new algorithms to solve linear and quadratic equations. In fact, al-Khwarizmi\u2019s name, translated into Latin as Algoritmi, led to the term algorithm. But, despite the familiarity with algorithms today \u2013 used throughout society from classroom algebra to cutting edge scientific research \u2013 the process of discovering new algorithms is incredibly difficult, and an example of the amazing reasoning abilities of the human mind.\nIn our paper, published today in Nature, we introduce AlphaTensor, the first artificial intelligence (AI) system for discovering novel, efficient, and provably correct algorithms for fundamental tasks such as matrix multiplication. This sheds light on a 50-year-old open question in mathematics about finding the fastest way to multiply two matrices.\nThis paper is a stepping stone in DeepMind\u2019s mission to advance science and unlock the most fundamental problems using AI. Our system, AlphaTensor, builds upon AlphaZero, an agent that has shown superhuman performance on board games, like chess, Go and shogi, and this work shows the journey of AlphaZero from playing games to tackling unsolved mathematical problems for the first time.\nMatrix multiplication is one of the simplest operations in algebra, commonly taught in high school maths classes. But outside the classroom, this humble mathematical operation has enormous influence in the contemporary digital world and is ubiquitous in modern computing.\nExample of the process of multiplying two 3x3 matrices.\nThis operation is used for processing images on smartphones, recognising speech commands, generating graphics for computer games, running simulations to predict the weather, compressing data and videos for sharing on the internet, and so much more. Companies around the world spend large amounts of time and money developing computing hardware to efficiently multiply matrices. So, even minor improvements to the efficiency of matrix multiplication can have a widespread impact.\nFor centuries, mathematicians believed that the standard matrix multiplication algorithm was the best one could achieve in terms of efficiency. But in 1969, German mathematician Volker Strassen shocked the mathematical community by showing that better algorithms do exist.\nStandard algorithm compared to Strassen\u2019s algorithm, which uses one less scalar multiplication (7 instead of 8) for multiplying 2x2 matrices. Multiplications matter much more than additions for overall efficiency.\nThrough studying very small matrices (size 2x2), he discovered an ingenious way of combining the entries of the matrices to yield a faster algorithm. Despite decades of research following Strassen\u2019s breakthrough, larger versions of this problem have remained unsolved \u2013 to the extent that it\u2019s not known how efficiently it\u2019s possible to multiply two matrices that are as small as 3x3.\nIn our paper, we explored how modern AI techniques could advance the automatic discovery of new matrix multiplication algorithms. Building on the progress of human intuition, AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that are more efficient than the state of the art for many matrix sizes. Our AI-designed algorithms outperform human-designed ones, which is a major step forward in the field of algorithmic discovery.\nFirst, we converted the problem of finding efficient algorithms for matrix multiplication into a single-player game. In this game, the board is a three-dimensional tensor (array of numbers), capturing how far from correct the current algorithm is. Through a set of allowed moves, corresponding to algorithm instructions, the player attempts to modify the tensor and zero out its entries. When the player manages to do so, this results in a provably correct matrix multiplication algorithm for any pair of matrices, and its efficiency is captured by the number of steps taken to zero out the tensor.\nThis game is incredibly challenging \u2013 the number of possible algorithms to consider is much greater than the number of atoms in the universe, even for small cases of matrix multiplication. Compared to the game of Go, which remained a challenge for AI for decades, the number of possible moves at each step of our game is 30 orders of magnitude larger (above 1033 for one of the settings we consider).\nEssentially, to play this game well, one needs to identify the tiniest of needles in a gigantic haystack of possibilities. To tackle the challenges of this domain, which significantly departs from traditional games, we developed multiple crucial components including a novel neural network architecture that incorporates problem-specific inductive biases, a procedure to generate useful synthetic data, and a recipe to leverage symmetries of the problem.\nWe then trained an AlphaTensor agent using reinforcement learning to play the game, starting without any knowledge about existing matrix multiplication algorithms. Through learning, AlphaTensor gradually improves over time, re-discovering historical fast matrix multiplication algorithms such as Strassen\u2019s, eventually surpassing the realm of human intuition and discovering algorithms faster than previously known.\nSingle-player game played by AlphaTensor, where the goal is to find a correct matrix multiplication algorithm. The state of the game is a cubic array of numbers (shown as grey for 0, blue for 1, and green for -1), representing the remaining work to be done.\nFor example, if the traditional algorithm taught in school multiplies a 4x5 by 5x5 matrix using 100 multiplications, and this number was reduced to 80 with human ingenuity, AlphaTensor has found algorithms that do the same operation using just 76 multiplications.\nAlgorithm discovered by AlphaTensor using 76 multiplications, an improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms.\nBeyond this example, AlphaTensor\u2019s algorithm improves on Strassen\u2019s two-level algorithm in a finite field for the first time since its discovery 50 years ago. These algorithms for multiplying small matrices can be used as primitives to multiply much larger matrices of arbitrary size.\nMoreover, AlphaTensor also discovers a diverse set of algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity \u2013 up to thousands of matrix multiplication algorithms for each size, showing that the space of matrix multiplication algorithms is richer than previously thought.\nAlgorithms in this rich space have different mathematical and practical properties. Leveraging this diversity, we adapted AlphaTensor to specifically find algorithms that are fast on a given hardware, such as Nvidia V100 GPU, and Google TPU v2. These algorithms multiply large matrices 10-20% faster than the commonly used algorithms on the same hardware, which showcases AlphaTensor\u2019s flexibility in optimising arbitrary objectives.\nAlphaTensor with an objective corresponding to the runtime of the algorithm. When a correct matrix multiplication algorithm is discovered, it's benchmarked on the target hardware, which is then fed back to AlphaTensor, in order to learn more efficient algorithms on the target hardware.\nFrom a mathematical standpoint, our results can guide further research in complexity theory, which aims to determine the fastest algorithms for solving computational problems. By exploring the space of possible algorithms in a more effective way than previous approaches, AlphaTensor helps advance our understanding of the richness of matrix multiplication algorithms. Understanding this space may unlock new results for helping determine the asymptotic complexity of matrix multiplication, one of the most fundamental open problems in computer science.\nBecause matrix multiplication is a core component in many computational tasks, spanning computer graphics, digital communications, neural network training, and scientific computing, AlphaTensor-discovered algorithms could make computations in these fields significantly more efficient. AlphaTensor\u2019s flexibility to consider any kind of objective could also spur new applications for designing algorithms that optimise metrics such as energy usage and numerical stability, helping prevent small rounding errors from snowballing as an algorithm works.\nWhile we focused here on the particular problem of matrix multiplication, we hope that our paper will inspire others in using AI to guide algorithmic discovery for other fundamental computational tasks. Our research also shows that AlphaZero is a powerful algorithm that can be extended well beyond the domain of traditional games to help solve open problems in mathematics. Building upon our research, we hope to spur on a greater body of work \u2013 applying AI to help society solve some of the most important challenges in mathematics and across the sciences.",

        "context": "\nThe ATP Finals is the season-ending championship of the ATP Tour. It is the most significant tennis event in the men's annual calendar after the four majors, as it features the top eight singles players and top eight doubles teams based on their results throughout the season. The eighth spot is reserved, if needed, for a player or team who won a major in the current year and is ranked from ninth to twentieth.\nThe tournament uses a unique format, not seen in other ATP Tour events, where the singles players\u2013and doubles teams\u2013are separated into two groups of four, within which they each play three round-robin matches. After the round-robin stage, the top two singles players\u2013and two top doubles teams\u2013from each group play in a knock-out semifinals and final to determine the champion(s).\nThe tournament was first held in 1970, although it was then known by a different name. Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic hold the record for the most singles titles with six, while Peter Fleming and John McEnroe jointly hold the record for the most doubles titles with seven.\nIn the tournament's current format, the champion can earn a maximum of 1,500 ranking points, if they win the event after going undefeated in the round-robin stage.\nBy winning the 2022 title, Djokovic earned a record $4,740,300, the highest payout for a tournament winner in tennis.[1] Also, Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury claimed $930,300, the highest payout in doubles history.[2]\nThe ATP Finals is the fifth iteration of a championship which began in 1970. It was originally known as the Masters Grand Prix and was part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit.[3] It was organised by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) and ran alongside the competing WCT Finals from 1971 to 1989. The Masters was a year-end showpiece event between the best players on the men's tour, but did not count for any world ranking points.\nIn 1990, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) took over the running of the men's tour and replaced the Masters with the \"ATP Tour World Championships\".[3] World ranking points were now at stake, with an undefeated champion earning the same number of points they would earn for winning one of the four Grand Slam events.[4] The ITF, who continued to run the Grand Slam tournaments, created a rival year-end event known as the Grand Slam Cup, which was contested by the 16 players with the best records in the Grand Slam tournaments of the season (1990\u201399).\nIn December 1999, the ATP and ITF agreed to discontinue the two separate events and create a new jointly-owned event called the \"Tennis Masters Cup\".[3] As with the Masters Grand Prix and the ATP Tour World Championships, the Tennis Masters Cup was contested by eight players and teams. However, the player or team ranked number eight in the ATP Race world rankings was not guaranteed a spot: if a player or team won one of the year's majors and finished the year ranked from ninth to twentieth, they were included in the Tennis Masters Cup instead. If two outside the top eight won majors, the higher-ranked of the two in the world rankings took the final spot. This accommodation for major champions continues in the event's current form.\nIn 2009, the championship was renamed the \"ATP World Tour Finals\" and was held at The O2 Arena in London.[3] The contract ran through 2013,[5] but was extended multiple times until it was last held there in 2020.[6][7][8] In 2017 the event was renamed the \"ATP Finals.\"[3][9][10] In April 2019, the ATP announced that Turin would host the ATP Finals from 2021 to 2025.[11]\nYears\nChampionships name\n1970\u201389\nMasters Grand Prix\n1990\u201399\nATP Tour World Championships\n2000\u201308\nTennis Masters Cup\n2009\u201316\nATP World Tour Finals\n2017\u2013\nATP Finals\nFor most of its history, the event has been considered the most important indoor tennis tournament in the world (there were a few exceptions when the event was held outdoors: 1974 in Melbourne & 2003\u201304 in Houston). The indoor atmosphere allows for controlled conditions of play, both in terms of the court surface and the court's illumination.\nIn recent years it has been played on indoor hard courts, however, indoor carpet was used in some previous editions. On one occasion, when Melbourne hosted the event in 1974, the grass courts of Kooyong Stadium were used;[12] the tournament was staged only 1\u20132 weeks before the 1975 Australian Open, which was also played on grass. Apart from 1974, all tournaments have been on a hard court variant, which has prompted calls from some players (such as Rafael Nadal)[13] to feature a greater variety of surfaces, including clay courts.[14][15]\nFor many years, the doubles event was held as a separate tournament staged the week after the singles competition, but more recently both events have been held together during the same week and in the same venue.\nIn 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to reduce the number of staff on-site, the ATP introduced live electronic line-calling powered by Hawk-Eye Live. Instead of line umpires, the system detects the relevant movements of the player and where the ball bounces on court. A pre-recorded voice announces \"Out\", \"Fault\", and \"Foot fault.\" Video review can be used for suspected double bounces, touches, and other reviewable calls.[16]\nThe tournament has traditionally been sponsored by the title sponsor of the tour; however, in 1990\u20132008 the competition was not sponsored, even though the singles portion of the event, as part of the ATP Tour, was sponsored by IBM. In 2009, the tournament gained Barclays PLC as its title sponsor.[17] Barclays confirmed in 2015 that they would not renew their sponsorship deal once it expires in 2016.[18] On 25 May 2017, it was announced that Nitto Denko would be the main sponsor for the tournament through 2020.[19] In September 2020, Nitto Denko announced it will extend its title partnership of the ATP Finals for another five years, until 2025.[20]\nIf more than one player or team won a Grand Slam event in the season and are ranked from eighth to twentieth, then whoever is highest-ranked is awarded the eighth spot; whoever is second highest-ranked is made first alternate.\nIf there is no player who won a major in the season and is ranked from eighth to twentieth, then the eight spot is awarded to the player ranked eighth.\nTwo alternates also attend the ATP Finals. If the first alternate has already been selected according to (3) mentioned above, then the second alternate is the highest-ranked player who has not otherwise qualified for the event. If both alternate spots are available, they are awarded to the two highest-ranked players who did not otherwise qualify for the event.\nAn alternate can replace a player who withdraws before the round-robin stage is over, so long as the player who withdraws still has at least one round-robin match left to play. When an alternate enters the competition, his results are considered separately, i.e. the alternate does not inherit the results of the player he is replacing. If an alternate's round-robin results qualify him for the semifinals, then he may continue into the single-elimination rounds.\nUnlike other events on the ATP Tour, the ATP Finals is not a straightforward single-elimination tournament. The eight players and teams are divided into two groups of four and each play three round-robin matches against the others in their group. After the round-robin stage, the top two performers in each group advance to the semifinals in a knock-out stage. The two winners of the semifinals play a final to determine the champion. In this format, it is theoretically possible to advance to the semifinals with two round-robin losses, but no player in the history of the singles tournament has won the title after losing more than one round-robin match.\nTo create the groups, the eight players and teams are seeded according to rank. The first and second seeds are placed in Group A and Group B, respectively. The remaining seeds are drawn in pairs (third and fourth, fifth and sixth, seventh and eighth); the first of the pair to be drawn goes to Group A and the other to Group B, and so on.\nThe format described above has been in place for all editions of the tournament except the following years:\n1970\u201371: All round robin (no groups), no semifinals or finals, the winner was decided based on round-robin standings.\n1982\u201384: 12-player three-round single-elimination tournament (no round robin), the top four seeds received byes in the first round.\nSince 2019, the group standings at the end of the round-robin stage are determined by, in order:[21]\nMost matches won.\nMost matches played (for example: the record 1\u20132 beats 1\u20131, and 2\u20131 beats 2\u20130).\nIf some players are tied, the following tiebreakers are used depending on how many players are tied (two or three):\nIf two players are tied, then:\nHead-to-head round-robin result.\nIf three players are tied, then the following tiebreakers are used, in order, until all three players are no longer tied OR until only two players are tied, at which point the two-player tie is broken by the head-to-head round robin result:\nHighest % of sets won.\nHighest % of games won.\nHighest ranking at the start of the tournament.\nWhen calculating tiebreakers, a match that ended in a retirement is counted as a 0\u20132 sets loss for the retiring player and a 2\u20130 sets win for their opponent, regardless of the actual score when the retirement occurred. When calculating the \"Highest % of games won\" tiebreaker, a match that ended in a retirement is disregarded.\n^John Barrett, ed. (1991). The International Tennis Federation : World of Tennis 1991.

The first Rugby World Cup for women was held in 1991, but it was not until the 1998 tournament that the tournament received official backing from the International Rugby Board (IRB, now World Rugby); by 2009, the IRB had retroactively recognized the 1991 and 1994 tournaments and their champions.[1]\nNormally, the tournament is held every four years; it was moved forward in 2017 so that the competition could be held in the year before the Commonwealth Games. The 2021 tournament was postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but still marketed as the 2021 Rugby World Cup.\nThree countries have won the women's Rugby World Cup since its establishment, with New Zealand having won the tournament a record six times.\nThe championship was previously branded as the Women's Rugby World Cup. As part of an effort to promote greater parity between the championship and its men's counterpart, the Rugby World Cup, World Rugby announced in 2019 that the women's championship would be marketed as the Rugby World Cup with no gender designation beginning in 2021.\nBefore the first Women's Rugby World Cup officially sanctioned by the International Rugby Board there had been three previous tournaments of a similar nature. The first of these was an event held in August 1990 in New Zealand. Though not considered a world cup, the tournament was referred to as the World Rugby Festival for Women. The competition included teams representing the United States, the Netherlands, Russia, and the hosts, New Zealand \u2013 who emerged as winners after defeating the United States in the final.\nThe first tournament referred to as the Women's Rugby World Cup was held in 1991 and hosted by Wales. Twelve countries were divided into four groups of three. The United States, against expectations, took the first championship with a 19\u20136 victory over England.[2] In the Plate competition Canada prevailed over Spain 18\u20134. Following the first tournament, it was decided to move the tournament schedule to the year prior to the next men's world cup, therefore reducing the quadrennial cycle to just three years.\nThe next event was originally scheduled to take place in Amsterdam but ended up being moved to Scotland. Eleven countries competed in the tournament with the English meeting the United States in the final for the second time; however, in this instance England emerged as winners.[3]\nThe 1998 tournament became the first women's world cup officially sanctioned by the International Rugby Board. Amsterdam, who were originally scheduled to host the previous world cup, hosted the largest ever tournament with all matches played at the new National Rugby Centre in the city's west end.[4] The tournament also saw a record sixteen teams compete. New Zealand, who withdrew from the previous tournament, also competed. The final saw New Zealand defeat the United States and claim their first world cup title.\nThe next event was taken to Spain in 2002. New Zealand won the title for the second time by defeating England 19\u20139 in the final.\nThe 2006 World Cup took place in Edmonton, Canada, and was the first major international rugby union tournament and women's world cup held in North America. New Zealand defeated England in the final to win their third successive world cup title.[5]\nWales v South Africa match in 2010\nA record four countries expressed interest in hosting the 2010 World Cup. After considering bids from England, Germany, Kazakhstan and South Africa, the IRB announced that the 2010 event would take place in England.[6] The tournament was staged in London, with the final played at the Twickenham Stoop.[7]\nIn August 2019, World Rugby announced that in an effort to \"elevate the profile of the women's game\", the women's championship will be marketed under the \"Rugby World Cup\" branding, with no gender designation, beginning in 2021. World Rugby stated that the decision was intended to promote gender equality and \"[eliminate] any inherent or perceived bias\" towards men's events, with chairman Bill Beaumont explaining that it \"demonstrates our ongoing and unwavering commitment to advancing women in rugby both on and off the field in line with our ambitious strategic plan.\" World Rugby became the first major sports federation to rebrand its events in such a way.[11]\nThe 2021 tournament in New Zealand was postponed by one year to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it will still be branded as the 2021 Rugby World Cup.[12]\nFrom 2025 the competition finals will be expanded to 16 teams, from the 12 competing in 2021.[13] On 12 May 2022, World Rugby announced that England, Australia and the United States would host the next three women's tournaments in 2025, 2029, and 2033 respectively. As part of a new strategy, Australia and the United States were also awarded the preceding men's tournaments in 2027 and 2031 respectively\u2014marking the first time that the men's and women's Rugby World Cup will be held successively in the same host nation.[14]\nQ = nation qualified for Final Tournament not yet played\nw = nation withdrew from (final) Tournament\ne = nation eliminated in qualifying stage and did not reach Final Tournament\n\u2013 = nation did not enter competition.\nThe following nations have participated in qualifying stages, but have never reached the Final Tournament:\ne = nation eliminated in qualifying stage and did not reach Final Tournament\nw = nation withdrew from qualifying stage\np = nation possibly eliminated in qualifying stage and will need to be successful in Repechage in order to reach Final Tournament\n\u2013 = nation did not enter qualifying stage competition.\nApart from the African region, the nations involved in the continental qualifying stages have not been announced as at 20 October 2019.\nThe format for the 2006 tournament split the 12 participating nations into four pools of three teams. Each nation played three games, after the completion of which a re-seeding process took place. Nations were moved into divisions dictated by their respective overall tournament ranking with the top teams proceeding to the knockout stages.\nThe 2010 event maintained the number of teams participating at twelve, with regional qualifying tournaments.[19] The 2021 tournament retained the same format, but with the classification round replaced with quarter-finals, as with the men's Rugby World Cup.[20][21] In 2025, the tournament will expand to 16 teams.[13]\nThe tournament has grown considerably in the past fifteen years although television audiences and event attendance still remain relatively low, especially in comparison to other women's world cup events. The final of the 2006 event in Canada was broadcast in a number of countries and streamed live via the internet.\nSky Sports broadcast 13 live matches from the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup, including the semi-finals, the third and fourth place play-off match and the final. The pool matches shown included all of England's matches, while each of the home nations' featured live too. There were also highlights shown from all other matches during the pool stages.[22]\nIn Ireland the Women's Rugby World Cup was broadcast by TG4 in 2014, the Irish language channel received praise for airing the tournament. TG4 provided coverage to all of the Irish matches as well as the final and semi-final.[23]\nCertain matches in the 2017 WRWC knockout phases drew strong TV viewership in England and France, and were broadcast live in the United States.[24]\nIn 2017, ITV started televising Women's Rugby Union World Cup matches on free-to-air TV for the first time in history, starting with the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup in Ireland.\n^A third place match was played \u2013 won by France, probably by 3\u20130. However, the game can only be considered as \"unofficial\" as it was not part of the original tournament plan, and the result was not recorded in any official tournament reports. The game is also not included in NZRFU international records.",

        "context": "\nThe Nazca Lines (/\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0zk\u0259/, /-k\u0251\u02d0/[1]) are a group of geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca Desert in southern Peru.[2] They were created between 500 BC and 500 AD by people making depressions or shallow incisions in the desert floor, removing pebbles and leaving different-colored dirt exposed.[3] There are two major phases of the Nazca lines, Paracas phase, from 400 to 200 BC, and Nazca phase, from 200 BC to 500 AD.[4] In the years leading up to 2020, between 80 and 100 new figures had been found with the use of drones, and archaeologists believe that there are more to be found.[5]\nMost lines run straight across the landscape, but there are also figurative designs of animals and plants. The combined length of all the lines is more than 1,300 km (800 mi), and the group covers an area of about 50 km2 (19 sq mi). The lines are typically 10 to 15 cm (4\u20136 in) deep. They were made by removing the top layer of reddish-brown iron oxide-coated pebbles to reveal a yellow-grey subsoil.[6][3] The width of the lines varies considerably, but more than half are slightly more than 33 cm (13 in) wide.[2][7] In some places they may be only 30 cm (12 in) wide, and in others reach 1.8 m (6 ft) wide.[2]\nSome of the Nazca lines form shapes that are best seen from the air (at around 500 m [1,600 ft]), although they are also visible from the surrounding foothills and other high places.[8][9][10] The shapes are usually made from one continuous line. The largest ones are about 370 m (400 yd) long.[6] Because of its isolation and the dry, windless, stable climate of the plateau, the lines have mostly been preserved naturally. Extremely rare changes in weather may temporarily alter the general designs. As of 2012, the lines are said to have been deteriorating because of an influx of squatters inhabiting the lands.[11][needs update]\nThe figures vary in complexity. Hundreds are simple lines and geometric shapes; more than 70 are zoomorphic designs, including a hummingbird, spider, fish, condor, heron, monkey, lizard, dog, cat, and a human. Other shapes include trees and flowers.[3] Scholars differ in interpreting the purpose of the designs, but in general, they ascribe religious significance to them.[12][13][14][15] They were designated in 1994 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe high, arid plateau stretches more than 80 km (50 mi) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa on the Pampas de Jumana, approximately 400 km (250 mi) south of Lima. The main PE-1S Panamericana Sur runs parallel to it. The main concentration of designs is in a 10 by 4 km (6 by 2 mi) rectangle, south of the hamlet of San Miguel de la Pascana. In this area, the most notable geoglyphs are visible.[citation needed]\nIn 1569, Luis Monz\u00f3n reported having seen ancient ruins in Peru, including the remains of \"roads\".[17]\nAlthough the lines were partially visible from nearby hills, the first to report them in the twentieth century were Peruvian military and civilian pilots. In 1927 Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mej\u00eda Xesspe spotted them while he was hiking through the foothills. He discussed them at a conference in Lima in 1939.[18]\nPaul Kosok, an American historian from Long Island University in New York, is credited as the first scholar to study the Nazca Lines in depth. While in Peru in 1940\u201341 to study ancient irrigation systems, he flew over the lines and realized that one was in the shape of a bird. Another chance observation helped him see how lines converged on the horizon at the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. He began to study how the lines might have been created, as well as to try to determine their purpose. He was joined by archaeologist Richard P. Schaedel from the United States, and Maria Reiche, a German mathematician and archaeologist from Lima, to try to determine the purpose of the Nazca Lines. They proposed that the figures were designed as astronomical markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose on significant dates. Archaeologists, historians, and mathematicians have all tried to determine the purpose of the lines.\nDetermining how they were made has been easier than determining why they were made. Scholars have theorized that the Nazca people could have used simple tools and surveying equipment to construct the lines. Archaeological surveys have found wooden stakes in the ground at the end of some lines, which supports this theory. One such stake was carbon-dated and was the basis for establishing the age of the design complex.[19]\nJoe Nickell, an American investigator of the paranormal, religious artifacts, and folk mysteries, reproduced the figures in the early twenty-first century by using the same tools and technology that would have been available to the Nazca people. In so doing, he refuted the 1969 hypothesis of Erich von D\u00e4niken,[20] who suggested that \"ancient astronauts\" had constructed these works. Scientific American characterized Nickell's work as \"remarkable in its exactness\" when compared to the existing lines.[21] With careful planning and simple technologies, Nickell proved that a small team of people could recreate even the largest figures within days, without any aerial assistance.[22]\nMost of the lines are formed on the ground by a shallow trench, with a depth between 10 and 15 cm (4 and 6 in). Such trenches were made by removing for a portion of the design, the reddish-brown, iron oxide-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca Desert. When this gravel is removed, the light-colored clay earth exposed in the bottom of the trench contrasts sharply in color and tone with the surrounding land surface, producing visible lines. This sub-layer contains high amounts of lime. With moisture from morning mist, it hardens to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds, thereby preventing erosion.[23]\nThe Nazca used this technique to \"draw\" several hundred simple, but huge, curvilinear animal and human figures. In total, the earthwork project is huge and complex: the area encompassing the lines is nearly 450 km2 (170 sq mi), and the largest figures can span nearly 370 m (1,200 ft).[6] Some figures have been measured: the hummingbird is 93 m (305 ft) long, the condor is 134 m (440 ft), the monkey is 93 by 58 m (305 by 190 ft), and the spider is 47 m (154 ft). The very dry, windless, and constant climate of the Nazca region has preserved the lines well.[4]\nThe discovery of two new small figures was announced in early 2011 by a Japanese team from Yamagata University. One of these resembles a human head and is dated to the early period of Nazca culture or earlier. The other, undated, is an animal. The team has been conducting fieldwork there since 2006, and by 2012 has found approximately 100 new geoglyphs.[24] In March 2012, the university announced that it would open a new research center at the site in September 2012, related to a longterm project to study the area for the next 15 years.[25]\nA June 2019 article in Smithsonian magazine describes recent work by a multi-disciplinary team of Japanese researchers who identified or re-identified some of the birds depicted.[26] They note that birds are the animals most frequently depicted in the Nazca geoglyphs. The team believes that some of the bird images that previous researchers assumed to be indigenous species more closely resemble exotic birds found in non-desert habitats. They speculated that \"The reason exotic birds were depicted in the geoglyphs instead of indigenous birds is closely related to the purpose of the etching process.\"[27]\nThe discovery of 143 new geoglyphs on the Nazca Pampa and in the surrounding area was announced in 2019 by Yamagata University and IBM Japan.[28] One of these was found by using machine learning-based methods.[29]\nLines forming the shape of a cat were discovered on a hill in 2020.[30] The figure is on a steep slope prone to erosion, explaining why it had not previously been discovered [31] until archaeologists carefully studied the image.[32] Drones are revealing sites for further research.[33]\nThe number of known Nazca geoglyphs amounted to 358 in 2022. Drones now are being used to assist the anthropologists researching the area and are expected to enable them to discover many more.[34]\nPaul Kosok and Maria Reiche advanced a purpose related to astronomy and cosmology, as has been common in monuments of other ancient cultures: the lines were intended to act as a kind of observatory, to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set at the solstices. Many prehistoric indigenous cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late Mississippian culture at Cahokia and other sites in present-day United States. Another example is Stonehenge in England. Newgrange in Ireland has tombs that are oriented to admit light at the winter solstice.\nMaria Reiche asserted that some or all of the figures represented constellations. By 1998, Phyllis B. Pitluga, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Reiche and senior astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, had concluded that the animal figures were \"representations of heavenly shapes.\" According to The New York Times, Pitluga \"contends they are not shapes of constellations, but of what might be called counter constellations, the irregularly-shaped dark patches within the twinkling expanse of the Milky Way.\"[36] Anthony Aveni criticized her work for failing to account for all the details.[citation needed]\nAlberto Rossell Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs. He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations.[37]\nIn 1985, archaeologist Johan Reinhard published archaeological, ethnographic, and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times. He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops. He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped. The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water. The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown.[citation needed]\nHenri Stierlin, a Swiss art historian specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping mummies of the Paracas culture.[38] He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive looms to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area. According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes. This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines. They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture.[citation needed]\nThe first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Isla. Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites. They compared the iconography of the lines to ceramics of the cultures. As archeologists, they believe that the figurative motifs of geoglyphs can be dated to having been made between 600 and 200 BC.[39]\nBased on the results of geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, David Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifers from which aqueducts (or puquios) collected water.[40]\nNicola Masini and Giuseppe Orefici have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco, about 10 km (6 mi) south of Pampa de Nasca, which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of Cahuachi.[41] In particular, using remote sensing techniques (from satellite to drone based remote sensing), they investigated and found \"five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function.\"[41][42] They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs. Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset. As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar. These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs.[41]\nOther theories were that the geometric lines could indicate water flow or irrigation schemes, or be a part of rituals to \"summon\" water. The spiders, birds, and plants may be fertility symbols. It also has been theorized that the lines could act as an astronomical calendar.[43]\nPhyllis Pitluga, senior astronomer at the Adler Planetarium and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Reiche, performed computer-aided studies of star alignments. She asserted the giant spider figure is an anamorphic diagram of the constellation Orion. She further suggested that three of the straight lines leading to the figure were used to track the changing declinations of the three stars of Orion's Belt. In a critique of her analysis, Dr. Anthony F. Aveni noted she did not account for the other 12 lines of the figure.[citation needed]\nHe commented generally on her conclusions, saying:\nI really had trouble finding good evidence to back up what she contended. Pitluga never laid out the criteria for selecting the lines she chose to measure, nor did she pay much attention to the archaeological data Clarkson and Silverman had unearthed. Her case did little justice to other information about the coastal cultures, save applying, with subtle contortions, Urton's representations of constellations from the highlands. As historian Jacquetta Hawkes might ask: was she getting the pampa she desired?[44]\nSwiss writer Erich von D\u00e4niken was fascinated by Nazca and was also a strong believer in extraterrestrial visitations. Von D\u00e4niken writes about his beliefs about archaeological sites such as the Egyptian pyramids, Stonehenge, and Easter Island, and how they are connected to extraterrestrials. He often explains the origins of religions as reactions of ancient people when they came in contact with an alien race. Von D\u00e4niken published a best-selling book titled Chariots of the Gods? in 1968. In this book he describes[45] his theory that these mysterious lines were used as landing sites for UFOs. He theorized that the shapes and lines were made by aliens and were created to help steer their spaceships, as well as work as landing pads. Von D\u00e4niken claimed the patterns at this site looked very similar to a modern airport and used this as evidence that proved that aliens used this area as a landing place for their spaceships. D\u00e4niken claimed that the Nazca lines site reflected visits by astronauts from other worlds, who became the creators of ancient civilizations. According[46] to Von D\u00e4niken, Sanskrit literature describes a story in which an aircraft landed on Earth, and the local people watched in amazement as \"human-like beings with golden, shimmering skins\" walked, mined for metals and then flew away in their ship. These ancient astronauts supposedly soon returned where they built landing tracks and then eventually left forever. The amazed Native Americans then considered Nazca a place of pilgrimage and generations of their people built more figures and runways as an invitation for gods to return, but they never did. Another of Erich von D\u00e4niken's theories about the Nazca was that figures that were found on Nazca clay vessels, which he assumed to be astronauts, were \"flying gods\" that were visiting from other worlds. He trashes and rebukes scientists who have studied Nazca, their research using radiocarbon tests to date the figures, their analyses of ceramic shards at the various sites, and also their careful dissections of Native American religious beliefs.\nAt the time[47] of Erich von D\u00e4niken's publishing of Chariots of the Gods?, scientists and archeologists such as Maria Reiche declared that his ideas were absurd and should be discarded. These scientists and archeologists also were able to prove that these lines could have been made using simple tools that would have been available to the people at the time they were created. Erich von D\u00e4niken's books \"Arrival of the Gods\" and \"Chariots of the Gods?\" were considered to not have any intellectual credibility or literary merit. Before Von D\u00e4niken's work other authors had presented ideas of extraterrestrial contact with ancient humans, but he failed to credit these authors, even when making the same claims and also using identical or similar evidence. Nevertheless, Von D\u00e4niken's books drew in thousands of visitors and believers to the site.\nThe Lines themselves are superficial, they are only 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in) deep and could be washed away... Nazca has only ever received a small amount of rain. But now there are great changes to the weather all over the world. The Lines cannot resist heavy rain without being damaged.\nAfter flooding and mudslides in the area in mid-February 2007, Mario Olaechea Aquije, archaeological resident from Peru's National Institute of Culture, and a team of specialists surveyed the area. He said, \"[T]he mudslides and heavy rains did not appear to have caused any significant damage to the Nazca Lines\". He noted that the nearby Southern Pan-American Highway did suffer damage, and \"the damage done to the roads should serve as a reminder to just how fragile these figures are.\"[49]\nIn 2012, squatters occupied land in the area, damaging a Nazca-era cemetery and allowing their pigs to have access to some of the land.[50]\nIn 2013, machinery used in a limestone quarry was reported to have destroyed a small section of a line, and caused damage to another.[51]\nIn December 2014, a controversy arose involving Greenpeace activity on the site, as Greenpeace activists set up a banner within the lines of one of the geoglyphs, damaging the site. Greenpeace issued an apology following the incident,[52] though one of the activists was convicted and fined for their part in causing damage.[53]\nThe Greenpeace incident also directed attention to other damage to geoglyphs outside of the World Heritage area caused in 2012 and 2013 by off-road vehicles of the Dakar Rally,[54] which is visible from satellite imagery.[55]\nIn January 2018, an errant truck driver was arrested but later released for lack of evidence indicating any intent other than a simple error. He had damaged three of the geoglyphs by leaving substantial tire marks across an area of approximately 46 m by 107 m (150 by 350 feet).[56][57]\nThe Paracas culture is considered by some historians to be the possible precursor that influenced the development of the Nazca Lines. In 2018, drones used by archaeologists revealed 25 geoglyphs in the Palpa province that are being assigned to the Paracas culture. Many predate the associated Nazca lines by a thousand years. Some demonstrate a significant difference in the subjects and locations, such as some being on hillsides.[58] Their co-discoverer, Peruvian archaeologist Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, indicates that many of these newly discovered geoglyphs represent warriors.[59] The Paracas is the same group that some believe created the well-known geoglyph known as the Paracas Candelabra.\n^page 141 Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n, La Chronica del Peru (The Chronicle of Peru), (Antwerp, (Belgium): Martin Nucio, 1554), p. 141. Note: Cieza discussed the Nazca region of Peru and said that \"y por algunas partes delos arenales se veen se\u00f1ales, paraque atinen el camino que han de llevar\" (\"and in some parts of the desert are seen signs, so that they [i.e., the Indians] find the path that has to be taken\").",

        "context": "\nThe Fields Medal is regarded as one of the highest honors a mathematician can receive, and has been described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics,[2][3][4] although there are several major differences, including frequency of award, number of awards, age limits, monetary value, and award criteria.[5] According to the annual Academic Excellence Survey by ARWU, the Fields Medal is consistently regarded as the top award in the field of mathematics worldwide,[6] and in another reputation survey conducted by IREG in 2013\u201314, the Fields Medal came closely after the Abel Prize as the second most prestigious international award in mathematics.[7][8]\nThe prize includes a monetary award which, since 2006, has been CA$15,000.[9][10] Fields was instrumental in establishing the award, designing the medal himself, and funding the monetary component, though he died before it was established and his plan was overseen by John Lighton Synge.[1]\nThe medal was first awarded in 1936 to Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. In 2014, the Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani became the first female Fields Medalist.[11][12][13] In total, 64 people have been awarded the Fields Medal.\nThe most recent group of Fields Medalists received their awards on 5 July 2022 in an online event which was live-streamed from Helsinki, Finland. It was originally meant to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but was moved following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nThe Fields Medal has for a long time been regarded as the most prestigious award in the field of mathematics and is often described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics.[2][3][4] Unlike the Nobel Prize, the Fields Medal is only awarded every four years. The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 on 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded. The under-40 rule is based on Fields's desire that \"while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others.\"[14] Moreover, an individual can only be awarded one Fields Medal; winners are ineligible to be awarded future medals.[15]\nFirst awarded in 1936, 64 people have won the medal as of 2022.[16] With the exception of two PhD holders in physics (Edward Witten and Martin Hairer),[17] only people with a PhD in mathematics have won the medal.[18]\nIn certain years, the Fields medalists have been officially cited for particular mathematical achievements, while in other years such specificities have not been given. However, in every year that the medal has been awarded, noted mathematicians have lectured at the International Congress of Mathematicians on each medalist's body of work. In the following table, official citations are quoted when possible (namely for the years 1958, 1998, and every year since 2006). For the other years through 1986, summaries of the ICM lectures, as written by Donald Albers, Gerald L. Alexanderson, and Constance Reid, are quoted.[19] In the remaining years (1990, 1994, and 2002), part of the text of the ICM lecture itself has been quoted.\n\"Achieved major results on the homotopy groups of spheres, especially in his use of the method of spectral sequences.

Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions.\nIn 1970, Sergei Novikov, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Nice to receive his medal.[125]\nIn 1978, Grigory Margulis, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Helsinki to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: \"I cannot but express my deep disappointment\u2014no doubt shared by many people here\u2014in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration.\"[126]\nIn 1982, the congress was due to be held in Warsaw but had to be rescheduled to the next year, because of martial law introduced in Poland on 13 December 1981. The awards were announced at the ninth General Assembly of the IMU earlier in the year and awarded at the 1983 Warsaw congress.[citation needed]\nIn 1998, at the ICM, Andrew Wiles was presented by the chair of the Fields Medal Committee, Yuri I. Manin, with the first-ever IMU silver plaque in recognition of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Don Zagier referred to the plaque as a \"quantized Fields Medal\". Accounts of this award frequently make reference that at the time of the award Wiles was over the age limit for the Fields medal.[128] Although Wiles was slightly over the age limit in 1994, he was thought to be a favorite to win the medal; however, a gap (later resolved by Taylor and Wiles) in the proof was found in 1993.[129][130]\nThe medal was designed by Canadian sculptor R. Tait McKenzie.[136] It is made of 14KT gold, has a diameter of 63.5mm, and weighs 169g.[137]\nOn the obverse is Archimedes and a quote attributed to 1st century AD poet Manilius, which reads in Latin: \"Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri\" (\"To surpass one's understanding and master the world\").[138][139] The year number 1933 is written in Roman numerals and contains an error (\"MCNXXXIII\" rather than \"MCMXXXIII\").[140] In capital Greek letters the word \u0391\u03a1\u03a7\u0399\u039c\u0397\u0394\u039f\u03a5\u03a3, or \"of Archimedes,\" is inscribed.\nOn the reverse is the inscription (in Latin):\nCONGREGATI\nEX TOTO ORBE\nMATHEMATICI\nOB SCRIPTA INSIGNIA\nTRIBUERE\nTranslation: \"Mathematicians gathered from the entire world have awarded [understood but not written: 'this prize'] for outstanding writings.\"\nIn the background, there is the representation of Archimedes' tomb, with the carving illustrating his theorem On the Sphere and Cylinder, behind an olive branch. (This is the mathematical result of which Archimedes was reportedly most proud: Given a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter, the ratio between their volumes is equal to 2\u20443.)\nThe Fields Medal gained some recognition in popular culture due to references in the 1997 film, Good Will Hunting. In the movie, Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) is an MIT professor who won the award prior to the events of the story. Throughout the film, references made to the award are meant to convey its prestige in the field.[142]\n^Riehm, C. (2002). \"The early history of the Fields Medal\"(PDF). Notices of the AMS. 49 (7): 778\u2013782. The Latin inscription from the Roman poet Manilius surrounding the image may be translated 'To pass beyond your understanding and make yourself master of the universe.' The phrase comes from Manilius's Astronomica 4.392 from the first century A.D.

        "context": "\nComic book collecting is a hobby that treats comic books and related items as collectibles or artwork to be sought after and preserved. Though considerably more recent than the collecting of postage stamps (philately) or books (bibliophilia), it has a major following around the world today and is partially responsible for the increased interest in comics after the temporary slump experienced during the 1980s.\nAs comic books regained their popularity in the 1960s during the boom of the Silver Age, fans organized comic book conventions, where they could meet to discuss their favorite comics with each other and eventually with the creators themselves. As of 2010[update], numerous conventions and festivals are held around the world, with Comic-Con International, held annually in San Diego, being the largest and best-known convention in the United States.\nWhile some people collect comic books for personal interest in the medium or characters, others prefer to collect for profit. To assist both types of comic book collector, comic book price guides are available and provide estimates of comic book values as well as information on comic book creators and characters. The price guides assign values for comic books based on demand, availability, and the copy's condition. The longest running price guide is the annual Overstreet Price Guide, first published in 1970. Another current monthly price guide is Comics Buyer's Guide. The growth of the Internet in the late 1990s saw development of online databases to track creator, character appearances, and storylines, as well as websites combining comic book price guides with personalized collection tracking to provide collection values in real-time. The Grand Comics Database is a popular online resource for comic book creator and character information. Popular online price guide and collection tracking services include comicbookrealm.com, comicspriceguide.com, and GPAnalysis. The increased popularity of online auctioning services like eBay or Heritage Auctions for buying and selling comic books has greatly increased the visibility of actual comic book sale prices, leading to improved price guide accuracy, particularly for online price guides such as comicspriceguide.com and GPAnalysis. GPA only tracks sales of slabbed books, and therefore is not an accurate indicator of overall comic sales.\nIn response to collectors' interest in preserving their collections, products designed for the protection and storage of comic books became available, including special bags; boxes; and acid-free \"backing boards\", designed to keep the comic book flat.\nBefore the late 1960s, virtually no specialized comic stores existed and the notion of comics as collectible art was in its infancy. A few collector-based retail establishments existed, most notably Pop Hollinger's retail and mail order shop for new and used comics in Concordia, Kansas, which was in full swing by 1940. Claude Held had followed suit in Buffalo, New York, by 1946.[1]\nThe origins of comic book collecting as an organized hobby has its roots in early science fiction fandom and comic book letters pages.[2] In the early 1960s, DC Comics began publishing the full addresses of the people writing in, which allowed comic fans to reach out to each other.[3]\nIn the US a few specialist shops had opened their doors by the 1960s, but were still a small market. In the UK, the only distribution channels available were ordinary news stands and mail order publications like Exchange and Mart or through zines run by the early panelologists themselves. Denver, Colorado-based retailer Chuck Rozanski played a large role in the growth of the comics speculation market in 1977 when he acquired the high-value \"Mile High Collection\" \u2013 16,000 comic books dating from 1937 to 1955 \u2013 and slowly began releasing select books into the marketplace.[4]\nDuring the late 1970s\u2013early 1980s major comic publishers like Marvel[5] and DC Comics started to recognize the new movements and started publishing material that was intended for sale in specialist shops only. When Marvel tested the new comics specialty market with the title Dazzler in 1981, the comic sold over 400,000 copies, a very respectable figure and one that astounded the company. Hereafter, comics publishers started tailoring ever-increasing percentages of marketing and production solely for the sale in specialist stores. While the bulk of the revenues still came from sales through regular channels, the ability to focus more specifically on specific target groups as well as distributing comics not on a sale-or-return basis, but in limited runs according to sales predictions from the retailers themselves, over-printing and overhead costs could be drastically reduced. From the 1970s to the present day, comics publishers have been targeting more and more of their titles to collector audiences with features such as limited editions, the use of high quality paper, or the inclusion of novelty items.\nOnce aware of this niche market, the mainstream press focused on its potential for making money. Features appeared in newspapers, magazines and television shows detailing how rare, high-demand comics such as Action Comics #1 and Incredible Hulk #181 (the first appearances of Superman and Wolverine, respectively) had sold for thousands of dollars, with Action #1 breaking the $1 million mark.[7]\nDuring this time, mainstream comic book publishers began to pander specifically to the collectors' market. Techniques used included variant covers, polybags, and gimmick covers. When a comic was polybagged, the collector had to choose between either reading the comic book or keeping it in pristine condition for potential financial gain, or buying two or more copies to do both. Gimmicks included glow-in-the-dark, hologram-enhanced, die-cut, embossing, foil stamped or foil-embossed covers.[7] Gimmicks were almost entirely cosmetic in nature, and almost never extended to improved content of the comics. However, many speculators would buy multiple copies of these issues, anticipating that demand would allow them to sell them for a substantial profit in the future.[citation needed]\nLow-budget independent publishers also proliferated during this period. The low price of producing comics, and the ease and efficiency of the direct market enabled fly-by-night publishers to flood the market with product, much of it of low quality.[8] A number of these publishers attempted to cash in on current trends \u2013 for every Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (itself a nod to the popularity of the Uncanny X-Men), there were multitudes of blatant rip-offs like Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters, Geriatric Gangrene Jujitsu Gerbils, and Pre-Teen Dirty Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos.[9]\nThis period also saw a corresponding expansion in price guide publications, most notably Wizard Magazine, which helped fuel the speculator boom[10] with monthly columns such as the \"Wizard Top 10\" (highlighting the \"hottest\" back-issues of the month), \"Market Watch\" (which not only reported back-issue market trends, but also predicted future price trends), and \"Comic Watch\" (highlighting key \"undervalued\" back-issues).\nThe speculators who made a profit or at least broke even on their comic book \"investments\" did so only by selling to other speculators.[citation needed] In truth, very few of the comics produced in the early 1990s have retained their value in the current market; with hundreds of thousands (or, in several prominent cases, over ten million) copies produced of certain issues, the value of these comics has all but disappeared. \"Hot\" comics like X-Men #1 and Youngblood #1[11] can today be found selling for under a dollar apiece.[citation needed]\nVeteran comic book fans pointed out an important fact about the collectors market that was largely overlooked by speculators: popular Golden Age comic books were valuable because they were genuinely rare. Since comic books were originally marketed to children and not viewed as collectible until much later, most Golden Age comics didn't survive to the present era. And before the 1990s, comic books were typically printed on cheap paper stock that aged very poorly. As a result, popular comic books published from the 1940s through the 1960s are extremely difficult to find and thus highly prized by collectors. By contrast, the speculator boom of the 1990s saw large print runs of comics on high-grade paper that were carefully stored by multitudes of collectors, creating a glut of product in the collectors market.[citation needed]\nThe comic book speculator market reached a saturation point in the early 1990s, and finally collapsed between 1993 through 1997. Two-thirds of all comic book specialty stores closed in this period,[7] and numerous publishers were driven out of business. Even industry giant Marvel Comics was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1997, although they were able to continue publishing. It is surmised that one of the main factors in Marvel's downfall was the decision to switch to self-distribution (via their purchase of Heroes World Distribution). Until then, many publishers went through secondary distributors (such as the current and only mass distributor, Diamond Comic Distributors), and Marvel felt it could preserve some of its cash flow if it made the move to becoming one of the few publishers to also distribute directly to the comic market. This backfired terribly when the bottom fell out of the market, as they were stocked with multiple printings of variant and \"collectible\" issues that were no longer in high demand, and they could not cover the costs of their distribution service.[citation needed]\nThe bust can also be linked back to some of the series that caused the boom a few years earlier. DC's decision to publish two blockbuster stories depicting the loss of their two major superheroes (\"Knightfall\" \u2013 the breaking of the Batman \u2013 and \"The Death of Superman\"), and their subsequent flooding of the press as to their supposed finality, is considered by some collectors to have started a slow decay within the non-regular buyer comic community which then led to drops in sales. Many comic retailers believe that numerous comic speculators took the death and crippling of two major characters to signify the end of the Batman and Superman series. As many comic readers and retailers knew full well, very little in comics actually changes with any finality. Many aspects of the status quo returned after the story arcs were over (Superman died, but was resurrected, and Batman was crippled, but eventually recovered).[citation needed]\nMany comic speculators who were only in the market to see important comics mature, then sell them for a profit, did not quite understand how quick the turnaround would be on the story recant, and many rushed out to scoop up as many copies of whatever issues were to be deemed significant. Comic shops received not only staggering sales during the week that Superman died,[7] but also had to try to meet the demand. This led to the saturation of the market and the devaluing of what was thought to be the end of an American icon. Some comic book retailers and theorists deem DC's practices in the press forum, and their relationship with the non-specialized consumer, to be grossly negligent of the status of the market, and that their marketing campaign, most likely not malicious in intent, spelled doom for the speculator market and comic sales in general. Others place the blame for the comic market crash on Marvel (whose product line had bloated to hundreds of separate titles by late 1993, including the poorly received \"Marvel UK\" and \"2099\" lines), or creator-owned upstart Image Comics, who fed the speculator feeding frenzy more than any other comics publisher.[12]\nOther publishing houses had different problems. Valiant Comics \u2013 at one point the third-largest comic book publisher \u2013 was sold to the video game giant Acclaim Entertainment for $65 million in June 1994.[13] Acclaim renamed the line Acclaim Comics in 1996. Their primary motivation was to make the properties more suitable for use in video game development. Eventually, Acclaim filed for bankruptcy following the collapse of its video game business. The miniseries Deathmate \u2013 a crossover between Image Comics and Valiant Comics \u2013 is often considered to have been the final nail in the speculation market's coffin; although heavily hyped and highly anticipated when initially solicited, the books from the Image Comics side shipped so many months late that reader interest disappeared by the time the series finally materialized, leaving some retailers holding hundreds of unsellable copies of the various Deathmate books.[14] Other companies, such as Broadway Comics, Comico, Continuity Comics, Defiant Comics, Eclipse Comics, First Comics, and Malibu Comics also ceased publication in the period between 1993 and 1997.[15]\nSince 1997, comic book sales have fallen to a fraction of early-1990s levels, with print runs of many popular titles down as much as 90% from their peaks. Currently, most of the hype generated around the major companies' comics involves changes to the characters, well-known creators writing or illustrating a title, and media coverage surrounding an adaptation to another medium such as film or television.[citation needed]\nThe one remaining bastion for comic speculation remains in online auction sites such as eBay; but even there, comic books remain a buyer's market. In the 2000s, prices for genuinely rare near-mint comics rose steadily, doubling in some cases. This was aided in part by newly established comic book grading companies, such as Comic Guaranty LLC (CGC) and Professional Grading eXperts LLC (PGX). Improved accountability has increased collector confidence, although some collectors have complained that the market has once again become more about speculation, instead of being focused on the art and stories.[16]\nUntil February 2002, the highest price paid for a comic book was $350,000 for Marvel Comics #1, bought by Jay Parrino (USA) in November 2001. The sale of a CGC-graded 8.0 \"very fine\" issue of Action Comics #1 reportedly sold between an undisclosed buyer and seller on the comic book online auction site \"Comic Connect\" for $1,000,000 topped the list[17] for a few days. It was quickly eclipsed by a CGC-graded 8.0 Very Fine Detective #27 (the first Batman comic book) at Heritage Auctions, which realized $1,075,500.[18] In July 2010, another Action Comics #1, a CGC-graded 8.5 was reportedly sold between an undisclosed buyer and seller on \"Comics Connect\" for $1.5 million, thus setting the current record for the highest sum ever paid for a comic book.[19]\nTo preserve comics, which are a printed medium, it is prescribed that they be stored in cool, dark places, as sunlight can bleach the inks and yellow the paper stock. Some collectors advise against storing comics in cardboard boxes, or using backing boards, as these are both sources of acid which can react with the fibers of the paper of comics, eventually destroying a comic. If these products are used to store comics, these collectors advise using products marked as acid free.[20]\nPET film, polyethylene or polypropylene storage bags are popular, and allow a comic to be \"bagged\" in a contained environment, and have become the traditional way of storing comics. Some comic shops now sell comics already in bags, although the quality of the bag can vary. These types of bags are not considered \"archival safe\" because various plastic compositions may contain elements or have other properties that could harm the comic in years to come. Mylars are the only bags available that are archival safe. Corrugated plastic boxes, preferred by some collectors, offer greater protection against acid while also offering better protection against moisture damage and vermin damage.[citation needed]\nOriginal art, typically 11x17 bristol boards with the pencils and ink, can be protected against direct sunlight as well as acid deterioration by using an archival quality frame coupled with glass which has been treated to protect against ultraviolet rays.[21][22]\nIn the column Comic Book Vitamins[23] on the Project Fanboy website, Steven Sykora discussed preserving collections by submitting comic books to the CGC, where comics are inspected for flaws, graded accordingly and placed in an inner well \u2013 a sealed sleeve of Barex, a highly gas-impermeable plastic polymer.[24] Then, the comics are sealed through a combination of compression and ultrasonic vibration in a transparent, hard plastic capsule. This process is often referred to in slang as \"slabbing\" and there is debate as to whether this provides better protection for the books than an acid-free backing board and Mylar sleeve.[citation needed]\nStoring a comic as a computer file (scanning and saving the comic as a comic book file or .cbz/.cbr) is also an option, allowing those without access to the comic itself a chance to see at the least the story for themselves. However, as with other digital means of storing media, this also allows for the possibility of copyright infringement via unauthorized digital distribution, such as peer-to-peer file sharing networks.[citation needed]\nA subscription crease describes a specific flaw in the condition of a comic book, particularly a crease through the entire book running from top to bottom. It is a term commonly used by comic book collectors. When comic book publishers began mailing comics directly to monthly subscribers they would simply fold the comic in half and stuff it into a standard #10 business envelope. This method was expedient and cost effective \u2013 the comic book business survived on razor-thin margins \u2013 but resulted in a clearly visible line running from top to bottom of a comic. The \"memory\" factor inherent in paper assured that this crease would be visible forever. Consequently, collectors, who prize condition, consider this a defect that lowers the desirability of a particular issue. This practice faded away in the early 1970s when publishers found a marketing opportunity in mailing comics in larger envelopes, unfolded. Hence the appearance of in-issue ads touting that monthly comics were \"Mailed flat!\"[25]\nCollecting original art is the collecting of the artists' production pencils and inks used in the creation of comic books. Unlike mass-produced comic books, there is only one piece of original art for each individual comic book page or cover.\nComic collectors are people who collect comics or comic books. Many comic readers keep their comics for an indefinite period and have large accumulations, but a true collector differs in enthusiasm and degree; collectors will generally at least seek past issues rather than being content to read what new comics come along.[citation needed]\nAs comic book characters become more mainstream through adaptations in other media (primarily television and film), a number of notable people have professed to be comic book collectors, such as:\nActor Nicolas Cage, who changed his original last name of Coppola (part of an extended family working in film, including his uncle Francis Ford Coppola) to the stage name \"Cage\", based on the Marvel Comics character Luke Cage, to avoid the appearance of nepotism[28] when he entered the film industry. A longtime comics fan, Cage amassed an impressive collection over the years, but in October 2002, he auctioned off most of his collection for combined proceeds of over $1.68 million[29] through Heritage Auctions. Heritage sold Nicolas Cage's remaining comics privately over the next year for approximately another $325,000, and in 2009 they also auctioned part of Cage's movie poster collection. Cage also starred in the 2007 film Ghost Rider and its 2012 sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.\nWriter, director and actor Kevin Smith, whose love for comics has been reflected in much of his film work in the so-called \"View Askewniverse\", particularly the film Mallrats. Smith has also written stories for comics published by Marvel and DC; as a nod to his work on the Daredevil comic, he had a cameo in the film adaptation as a morgue worker.\nActor Samuel L. Jackson is a reader and collector well into middle age, stating as recently as a July 2006 interview that he was reading currently-published comic books.[31] Jackson gave Marvel Comics permission to use his likeness for the re-imagined \"Ultimate\" version of Nick Fury,[32] and later played a similar version of Fury in several of the film and television projects comprising the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nWith comics being a popular topic on the Internet, many websites dedicated to helping users manage their comic collections have been created.

        "context": "\nThe 60th TOP500 was published in November 2022. Since June 2022, the United States' Frontier is the most powerful supercomputer on TOP500, reaching 1102 petaFlops (1.102 exaFlops) on the LINPACK benchmarks.[2] The United States has by far the highest share of total computing power on the list (nearly 50%),[3] while China currently leads the list in number of systems with 173 supercomputers, with the U.S. not far behind in second place.\nRapid growth of supercomputer performance, based on data from the top500.org website. The loga\u00adrithmic y-axis shows performance in GFLOPS.\nCombined performance of 500 largest supercomputers\nFastest supercomputer\nSupercomputer in 500th place\nIn the early 1990s, a new definition of supercomputer was needed to produce meaningful statistics. After experimenting with metrics based on processor count in 1992, the idea arose at the University of Mannheim to use a detailed listing of installed systems as the basis. In early 1993, Jack Dongarra was persuaded to join the project with his LINPACK benchmarks. A first test version was produced in May 1993, partly based on data available on the Internet, including the following sources:[4][5]\n\"List of the World's Most Powerful Computing Sites\" maintained by Gunter Ahrendt[6]\nDavid Kahaner, the director of the Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP);[7] published a report in 1992, titled \"Kahaner Report on Supercomputer in Japan\"[5] which had an immense amount of data.[citation needed]\nThe information from those sources was used for the first two lists. Since June 1993, the TOP500 is produced bi-annually based on site and vendor submissions only.\nSince 1993, performance of the No. 1 ranked position has grown steadily in accordance with Moore's law, doubling roughly every 14 months. In June 2018, Summit was fastest with an Rpeak[8] of 187.6593 PFLOPS. For comparison, this is over 1,432,513 times faster than the Connection Machine CM-5/1024 (1,024 cores), which was the fastest system in November 1993 (twenty-five years prior) with an Rpeak of 131.0 GFLOPS.[9]\nTwo computers which first appeared on the list in 2018 are based on architectures new to the TOP500. One was a new x86-64 microarchitecture from Chinese manufacturer Sugon, using Hygon Dhyana CPUs (these resulted from a collaboration with AMD, and are a minor variant of Zen-based AMD EPYC) and was ranked 38th, now 117th,[12] and the other was the first ARM-based computer on the list \u2013 using Cavium ThunderX2 CPUs.[13] Before the ascendancy of 32-bitx86 and later 64-bitx86-64 in the early 2000s, a variety of RISC processor families made up most TOP500 supercomputers, including SPARC, MIPS, PA-RISC, and Alpha.\nShare of operating systems families in TOP500 supercomputers by time trend\nSince November 2015, no computer on the list runs Windows (while Microsoft reappeared on the list in 2021 with Ubuntu based on Linux). In November 2014, Windows Azure[16] cloud computer was no longer on the list of fastest supercomputers (its best rank was 165th in 2012), leaving the Shanghai Supercomputer Center's Magic Cube as the only Windows-based supercomputer on the list, until it also dropped off the list. It was ranked 436th in its last appearance on the list released in June 2015, while its best rank was 11th in 2008.[17] There are no longer any Mac OS computers on the list. It had at most five such systems at a time, one more than the Windows systems that came later, while the total performance share for Windows was higher. Their relative performance share of the whole list was however similar, and never high for either. In 2004 System X supercomputer based on Mac OS X (Xserve, with 2,200 PowerPC 970 processors) once ranked 7th place.[18]\nIt has been well over a decade since MIPS systems dropped entirely off the list[19] though the Gyoukou supercomputer that jumped to 4th place[20] in November 2017 had a MIPS-based design as a small part of the coprocessors. Use of 2,048-core coprocessors (plus 8\u00d7 6-core MIPS, for each, that \"no longer require to rely on an external Intel Xeon E5 host processor\"[21]) made the supercomputer much more energy efficient than the other top 10 (i.e. it was 5th on Green500 and other such ZettaScaler-2.2-based systems take first three spots).[22] At 19.86 million cores, it was by far the largest system by core-count, with almost double that of the then-best manycore system, the Chinese Sunway TaihuLight.\nAs of November 2023[update], the number one supercomputer, Frontier, an AMD-based system, is also the number two system on Green500. [23] The leader on Green500 is the even smaller new Henri, Nvidia-based supercomputer. In June 2022, the top 4 systems of Graph500 both used AMD CPUs and AMD accelerators.\nAfter an upgrade, for the 56th TOP500 in November 2020,\nFugaku grew its HPL performance to 442 petaflops, a modest increase from the 416 petaflops the system achieved when it debuted in June 2020. More significantly, the ARMv8.2 based Fugaku increased its performance on the new mixed precision HPC-AI benchmark to 2.0 exaflops, besting its 1.4 exaflops mark recorded six months ago. These represent the first benchmark measurements above one exaflop for any precision on any type of hardware.[24]\nSummit, a previously fastest supercomputer, is currently highest-ranked IBM-made supercomputer; with IBM POWER9 CPUs. Sequoia became the last IBM Blue Gene/Q model to drop completely off the list; it had been ranked 10th on the 52nd list (and 1st on the June 2012, 41st list, after an upgrade).\nFor the first time, all 500 systems deliver a petaflop or more on the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, with the entry level to the list now at 1.022 petaflops.\" However, for a different benchmark \"Summit and Sierra remain the only two systems to exceed a petaflop on the HPCG benchmark, delivering 2.9 petaflops and 1.8 petaflops, respectively. The average HPCG result on the current list is 213.3 teraflops, a marginal increase from 211.2 six months ago.[25]\nMicrosoft is back on the TOP500 list with six Microsoft Azure instances (that use/are benchmarked with Ubuntu, so all the supercomputers are still Linux-based), with CPUs and GPUs from same vendors, the fastest one currently 11th,[26] and another older/slower previously made 10th.[27] And Amazon with one AWS instance currently ranked 64th (it was previously ranked 40th). The number of Arm-based supercomputers is 6, currently all Arm-based supercomputers use the same Fujitsu CPU as in the number 2 system, with the next one previously ranked 13th, now 25th.[28]\nRank \u2013 Position within the TOP500 ranking. In the TOP500 list table, the computers are ordered first by their Rmax value. In the case of equal performances (Rmax value) for different computers, the order is by Rpeak. For sites that have the same computer, the order is by memory size and then alphabetically.\nNumbers below represent the number of computers in the TOP500 that are in each of the listed countries or territories. As of 2023, United States has the most supercomputers on the list, with 150 machines. The United States has the highest aggregate computational power at 2,344 Petaflops Rmax with Japan second (639 Pflop/s) and China third (455 Pflop/s).\nDistribution of supercomputers in the TOP500 list by country (as of June 2023[update])[32]\nNote: All operating systems of the TOP500 systems are Linux-family based, but Linux above is generic Linux.\nSunway TaihuLight is the system with the most CPU cores (10,649,600). Tianhe-2 has the most GPU/accelerator cores (4,554,752). Fugaku is the system with the greatest power consumption with 29,900 kilowatts.\nIn November 2014, it was announced that the United States was developing two new supercomputers to exceed China's Tianhe-2 in its place as world's fastest supercomputer. The two computers, Sierra and Summit, will each exceed Tianhe-2's 55 peak petaflops. Summit, the more powerful of the two, will deliver 150\u2013300 peak petaflops.[76] On 10 April 2015, US government agencies banned selling chips, from Nvidia to supercomputing centers in China as \"acting contrary to the national security ... interests of the United States\";[77] and Intel Corporation from providing Xeon chips to China due to their use, according to the US, in researching nuclear weapons \u2013 research to which US export control law bans US companies from contributing \u2013 \"The Department of Commerce refused, saying it was concerned about nuclear research being done with the machine.\"[78]\nIn June 2016, Japanese firm Fujitsu announced at the International Supercomputing Conference that its future exascale supercomputer will feature processors of its own design that implement the ARMv8 architecture. The Flagship2020 program, by Fujitsu for RIKEN plans to break the exaflops barrier by 2020 through the Fugaku supercomputer, (and \"it looks like China and France have a chance to do so and that the United States is content \u2013 for the moment at least \u2013 to wait until 2023 to break through the exaflops barrier.\"[80]) These processors will also implement extensions to the ARMv8 architecture equivalent to HPC-ACE2 that Fujitsu is developing with Arm.[80]\nIn June 2016, Sunway TaihuLight became the No. 1 system with 93 petaflop/s (PFLOP/s) on the Linpack benchmark.[81]\nIn November 2016, Piz Daint was upgraded, moving it from 8th to 3rd, leaving the US with no systems under the TOP3 for only the 2nd time ever.[82][83]\nInspur has been one of the largest HPC system manufacturer based out of Jinan, China. As of May 2017[update], Inspur has become the third manufacturer to have manufactured 64-way system \u2013 a record which has been previously mastered by IBM and HP. The company has registered over $10B in revenues and have successfully provided a number of HPC systems to countries outside China such as Sudan, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela. Inspur was also a major technology partner behind both the supercomputers from China, namely Tianhe-2 and Taihu which lead the top 2 positions of TOP500 supercomputer list up to November 2017. Inspur and Supermicro released a few platforms aimed at HPC using GPU such as SR-AI and AGX-2 in May 2017.[84]\nIn November 2017, for the second time in a row there were no system from the US under the TOP3. No. 1 and No. 2 were installed in China, a system in Switzerland at #3, and a new system in Japan was #4 pushing the top US system to #5.[85]\nIn June 2018, Summit, an IBM-built system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee, US, took the No. 1 spot with a performance of 122.3 petaflop/s (PFLOP/s), and Sierra, a very similar system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, CA, USA took #3. These two system took also the first two spots on the HPCG benchmark. Due to Summit and Sierra, the US took back the lead as consumer of HPC performance with 38.2% of the overall installed performance while China was second with 29.1% of the overall installed performance. For the first time ever, the leading HPC manufacturer is not a US company. Lenovo took the lead with 23.8% of systems installed. It is followed by HPE with 15.8%, Inspur with 13.6%, Cray with 11.2%, and Sugon with 11%.\n[86]\nOn 7 May 2019, The U.S. Department of Energy announced a contract with Cray to build the \"Frontier\" supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Frontier is anticipated to be operational in 2021 and, with a performance of greater than 1.5 exaflops, should then be the world's most powerful computer.[89]\nSince June 2019, all TOP500 systems deliver a petaflop or more on the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, with the entry level to the list now at 1.022 petaflops.[90]\nIn May 2022, the Frontier supercomputer broke the exascale barrier, completing more than a quintillion 64-bit floating point arithmetic calculations per second. Frontier clocked in at approximately 1.1 exaflops, beating out the previous record-holder, Fugaku.[91][92]\nSome major systems are not on the list. A prominent example is the NCSA's Blue Waters which publicly announced the decision not to participate in the list[93] because they do not feel it accurately indicates the ability of any system to do useful work.[94] Other organizations decide not to list systems for security and/or commercial competitiveness reasons. One such example is the National Supercomputing Center at Qingdao's OceanLight supercomputer, completed in March 2021, which was submitted for, and won, the Gordon Bell Prize. The computer is an exaflop computer, but was not submitted to the TOP500 list; the first exaflop machine submitted to the TOP500 list was Frontier. Analysts suspected that the reason the NSCQ did not submit what would otherwise have been the world's first exascale supercomputer was to avoid inflaming political sentiments and fears within the United States, in the context of the United States \u2013 China trade war.[95] Additional purpose-built machines that are not capable or do not run the benchmark were not included, such as RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 and MDGRAPE-4. A Google Tensor Processing Unit v4 pod is capable of 1.1 exaflops of peak performance,[96] however these units are highly specialized to run machine learning workloads and the TOP500 measures a specific benchmark algorithm using a specific numeric precision.\n^\"The 2,048-core PEZY-SC2 sets a Green500 record\". WikiChip Fuse. 1 November 2017. Archived from the original on 16 November 2017. Retrieved 15 November 2017. Powering the ZettaScaler-2.2 is the PEZY-SC2. The SC2 is a second-generation chip featuring twice as many cores \u2013 i.e., 2,048 cores with 8-way SMT for a total of 16,384 threads. [..] The first-generation SC incorporated two ARM926 cores and while that was sufficient for basic management and debugging its processing power was inadequate for much more. The SC2 uses a hexa-core P-Class P6600 MIPS processor which share the same memory address as the PEZY cores, improving performance and reducing data transfer overhead. With the powerful MIPS management cores, it is now also possible to entirely eliminate the Xeon host processor. However, PEZY has not done so yet.\n^Summit, an IBM-built supercomputer now running at the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), captured the number one spot June 2018 with a performance of 122.3 petaflops on High Performance Linpack (HPL), the benchmark used to rank the TOP500 list.

        "context": "\nCross-linked DNA extracted from the 4,000-year-old liver of the ancient Egyptian priest Nekht-Ankh\nAncient DNA (aDNA) is DNA isolated from ancient specimens.[1][2] Due to degradation processes (including cross-linking, deamination and fragmentation)[3] ancient DNA is more degraded in comparison with contemporary genetic material.[4] Even under the best preservation conditions, there is an upper boundary of 0.4\u20131.5 million years for a sample to contain sufficient DNA for sequencing technologies.[5] The oldest sample ever sequenced is estimated to be 1.65 million years old.[6] Genetic material has been recovered from paleo/archaeological and historical skeletal material, mummified tissues, archival collections of non-frozen medical specimens, preserved plant remains, ice and from permafrost cores, marine and lake sediments and excavation dirt. On 7 December 2022, The New York Times reported that two-million year old genetic material was found in Greenland, and is currently considered the oldest DNA discovered so far.[7][8]\nThe first study of what would come to be called aDNA was conducted in 1984, when Russ Higuchi and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley reported that traces of DNA from a museum specimen of the Quagga not only remained in the specimen over 150 years after the death of the individual, but could be extracted and sequenced.[9] Over the next two years, through investigations into natural and artificially mummified specimens, Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo confirmed that this phenomenon was not limited to relatively recent museum specimens but could apparently be replicated in a range of mummified human samples that dated as far back as several thousand years.[10][11][12]\nThe laborious processes that were required at that time to sequence such DNA (through bacterial cloning) were an effective brake on the study of ancient DNA (aDNA) and the field of museomics. However, with the development of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in the late 1980s, the field began to progress rapidly.[13][14][15] Double primer PCR amplification of aDNA (jumping-PCR) can produce highly skewed and non-authentic sequence artifacts. Multiple primer, nested PCR strategy was used to overcome those shortcomings.\nThe post-PCR era heralded a wave of publications as numerous research groups claimed success in isolating aDNA. Soon a series of incredible findings had been published, claiming authentic DNA could be extracted from specimens that were millions of years old, into the realms of what Lindahl (1993b) has labelled Antediluvian DNA.[16] The majority of such claims were based on the retrieval of DNA from organisms preserved in amber. Insects such as stingless bees,[17][18] termites,[19] and wood gnats,[20] as well as plant[21] and bacterial[22] sequences were said to have been extracted from Dominican amber dating to the Oligocene epoch. Still older sources of Lebanese amber-encased weevils, dating to within the Cretaceous epoch, reportedly also yielded authentic DNA.[23] Claims of DNA retrieval were not limited to amber.\nReports of several sediment-preserved plant remains dating to the Miocene were published.[24][25] Then in 1994, Woodward et al. reported what at the time was called the most exciting results to date[26] \u2014 mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences that had apparently been extracted from dinosaur bones dating to more than 80 million years ago. When in 1995 two further studies reported dinosaur DNA sequences extracted from a Cretaceous egg,[27][28] it seemed that the field would revolutionize knowledge of the Earth's evolutionary past. Even these extraordinary ages were topped by the claimed retrieval of 250-million-year-old halobacterial sequences from halite.[29][30]\nThe development of a better understanding of the kinetics of DNA preservation, the risks of sample contamination and other complicating factors led the field to view these results more skeptically. Numerous careful attempts failed to replicate many of the findings, and all of the decade's claims of multi-million year old aDNA would come to be dismissed as inauthentic.[31]\nSingle primer extension amplification was introduced in 2007 to address postmortem DNA modification damage.[32] Since 2009 the field of aDNA studies has been revolutionized with the introduction of much cheaper research techniques.[33] The use of high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques in the field of ancient DNA research has been essential for reconstructing the genomes of ancient or extinct organisms. A single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library preparation method has sparked great interest among ancient DNA (aDNA) researchers.[34][35]\nIn addition to these technical innovations, the start of the decade saw the field begin to develop better standards and criteria for evaluating DNA results, as well as a better understanding of the potential pitfalls.[31][36]\nOn 7 December 2022, The New York Times reported that two-million year old genetic material was found in Greenland, and is currently considered the oldest DNA discovered so far.[7][8]\nDue to degradation processes (including cross-linking, deamination and fragmentation),[3] ancient DNA is of lower quality than modern genetic material.[4] The damage characteristics and ability of aDNA to survive through time restricts possible analyses and places an upper limit on the age of successful samples.[4] There is a theoretical correlation between time and DNA degradation,[37] although differences in environmental conditions complicate matters. Samples subjected to different conditions are unlikely to predictably align to a uniform age-degradation relationship.[38] The environmental effects may even matter after excavation, as DNA decay-rates may increase,[39] particularly under fluctuating storage conditions.[40] Even under the best preservation conditions, there is an upper boundary of 0.4 to 1.5 million years for a sample to contain sufficient DNA for contemporary sequencing technologies.[5]\nResearch into the decay of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in moa bones has modelled mitochondrial DNA degradation to an average length of 1 base pair after 6,830,000 years at \u22125 \u00b0C.[4] The decay kinetics have been measured by accelerated aging experiments, further displaying the strong influence of storage temperature and humidity on DNA decay.[41] Nuclear DNA degrades at least twice as fast as mtDNA. Early studies that reported recovery of much older DNA, for example from Cretaceousdinosaur remains, may have stemmed from contamination of the sample.\nA critical review of ancient DNA literature through the development of the field highlights that few studies have succeeded in amplifying DNA from remains older than several hundred thousand years.[42] A greater appreciation for the risks of environmental contamination and studies on the chemical stability of DNA have raised concerns over previously reported results. The alleged dinosaur DNA was later revealed to be human Y-chromosome.[43] The DNA reported from encapsulated halobacteria has been criticized based on its similarity to modern bacteria, which hints at contamination,[36] or they may be the product of long-term, low-level metabolic activity.[44]\naDNA may contain a large number of postmortem mutations, increasing with time. Some regions of polynucleotide are more susceptible to this degradation, allowing erroneous sequence data to bypass statistical filters used to check the validity of data.[31] Due to sequencing errors, great caution should be applied to interpretation of population size.[45] Substitutions resulting from deamination of cytosine residues are vastly over-represented in the ancient DNA sequences. Miscoding of C to T and G to A accounts for the majority of errors.[46]\nAnother problem with ancient DNA samples is contamination by modern human DNA and by microbial DNA (most of which is also ancient).[47][48] New methods have emerged in recent years to prevent possible contamination of aDNA samples, including conducting extractions under extreme sterile conditions, using special adapters to identify endogenous molecules of the sample (distinguished from those introduced during analysis), and applying bioinformatics to resulting sequences based on known reads in order to approximate rates of contamination.[49][50]\nDevelopment in the aDNA field in the 2000s increased the importance of authenticating recovered DNA to confirm that it is indeed ancient and not the result of recent contamination. As DNA degrades over time, the nucleotides that make up the DNA may change, especially at the ends of the DNA molecules. The deamination of cytosine to uracil at the ends of DNA molecules has become a way of authentication. During DNA sequencing, the DNA polymerases will incorporate an adenine (A) across from the uracil (U), leading to cytosine (C) to thymine (T) substitutions in the aDNA data.[51] These substitutions increase in frequency as the sample gets older. Frequency measurement of the C-T level, ancient DNA damage, can be made using various software such as mapDamage2.0 or PMDtools [52][53] and interactively on metaDMG.[54] Due to hydrolytic depurination, DNA fragments into smaller pieces, leading to single-stranded breaks. Combined with the damage pattern, this short fragment length can also help differentiate between modern and ancient DNA.[55][56]\nDespite the problems associated with 'antediluvian' DNA, a wide and ever-increasing range of aDNA sequences have now been published from a range of animal and plant taxa. Tissues examined include artificially or naturally mummified animal remains,[9][57] bone,[58][59][60][61] paleofaeces,[62][63] alcohol preserved specimens,[64] rodent middens,[65] dried plant remains,[66][67] and recently, extractions of animal and plant DNA directly from soil samples.[68]\nResearchers in 2016 measured chloroplast DNA in marine sediment cores, and found diatom DNA dating back to 1.4 million years.[74] This DNA had a half-life significantly longer than previous research, of up to 15,000 years. Kirkpatrick's team also found that DNA only decayed along a half-life rate until about 100 thousand years, at which point it followed a slower, power-law decay rate.[74]\nMap of human fossils with an age of at least ~40,000 years that yielded genome-wide data[75]\nDue to the considerable anthropological, archaeological, and public interest directed toward human remains, they have received considerable attention from the DNA community. There are also more profound contamination issues, since the specimens belong to the same species as the researchers collecting and evaluating the samples.\nDue to the morphological preservation in mummies, many studies from the 1990s and 2000s used mummified tissue as a source of ancient human DNA. Examples include both naturally preserved specimens, such as the \u00d6tzi the Iceman frozen in a glacier[76] and bodies preserved through rapid desiccation at high altitude in the Andes,[12][77] as well as various chemically treated preserved tissue such as the mummies of ancient Egypt.[78] However, mummified remains are a limited resource. The majority of human aDNA studies have focused on extracting DNA from two sources much more common in the archaeological record: bones and teeth. The bone that is most often used for DNA extraction is the petrous ear bone, since its dense structure provides good conditions for DNA preservation.[79] Several other sources have also yielded DNA, including paleofaeces,[80] and hair.[81][82] Contamination remains a major problem when working on ancient human material.\nAncient pathogen DNA has been successfully retrieved from samples dating to more than 5,000 years old in humans and as long as 17,000 years ago in other species. In addition to the usual sources of mummified tissue, bones and teeth, such studies have also examined a range of other tissue samples, including calcified pleura,[83] tissue embedded in paraffin,[84][85] and formalin-fixed tissue.[86] Efficient computational tools have been developed for pathogen and microorganism aDNA analyses in a small (QIIME[87]) and large scale (FALCON [88]).\nTaking preventative measures in their procedure against such contamination though, a 2012 study analyzed bone samples of a Neanderthal group in the El Sidr\u00f3n cave, finding new insights on potential kinship and genetic diversity from the aDNA.[89] In November 2015, scientists reported finding a 110,000-year-old tooth containing DNA from the Denisovan hominin, an extinctspecies of human in the genus Homo.[90][91]\nThe research has added new complexity to the peopling of Eurasia. A study from 2018 [92] showed that a Bronze Age mass migration had greatly impacted the genetic makeup of the British Isles, bringing with it the Bell Beaker culture from mainland Europe.\nIt has also revealed new information about links between the ancestors of Central Asians and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. In Africa, older DNA degrades quickly due to the warmer tropical climate, although, in September 2017, ancient DNA samples, as old as 8,100 years old, have been reported.[93]\nMoreover, ancient DNA has helped researchers to estimate modern human divergence.[94] By sequencing African genomes from three Stone Age hunter gatherers (2000 years old) and four Iron Age farmers (300 to 500 years old), Schlebusch and colleagues were able to push back the date of the earliest divergence between human populations to 350,000 to 260,000 years ago.",

        "context": "\nAbel Makkonen Tesfaye[a] was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario.[21] He is the only child of Ethiopian immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu,[b] who separated shortly after his birth.[23][24] He was brought up in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother.[21][25] He has an estranged relationship with his father, telling Rolling Stone in 2015 that \"I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived \u2014 I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there.\"[24]\nWhen he was 17, Tesfaye dropped out of school and moved to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends; including his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor.[31] He has described this period as being like the 1995 film Kids \"without the AIDS\", as they lived a hedonistic lifestyle.[21][32] He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to \"smarten up, to focus.\"[33][34]\nTesfaye often used drugs and abused illegal substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup.[35] In December 2016, he stated that drugs were a \"crutch\" for him when it came to writing music.[36] In August 2021, during a cover story with GQ, he described himself as being \"sober lite\", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: \"I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there.\"[37]\nIn August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube.[38][39] The following year, he met Jeremy Rose, a producer who had an idea for a dark contemporary R&B project. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyle rapped over it. Rose produced three songs \u2013 \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Party & The After Party\" \u2013 and others that Tesfaye had sung on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would be credited for them.[40] In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Morning\" to YouTube under the username \"xoxxxoooxo\".[41][42] His identity was initially unknown. The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from rapper Drake.[40][43] The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including Pitchfork and The New York Times.[44]\nBefore adopting the stage name the Weeknd, Tesfaye released music under the aliases the Noise and Kin Kane.[24] His current stage name was chosen in tribute to when he dropped out of school, took his mattress, \"left one weekend and never came home.\" However, Rose claims the name was his idea.[26][45] The last 'e' was excluded to avoid trademark problems with pop rock band the Weekend.[46] In the beginning of his career, Tesfaye worked at American Apparel. Due to his anonymity, his co-workers listened to his music without knowing it was him.[47][48][49]\nIn July 2011, Tesfaye held his first live performance at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto.[58] After the performance, Drake met with Tesfaye to discuss collaborations, which led to Tesfaye earning an appearance at his OVO Festival.[59] He also participated in concerts hosted by the Black Student Association at the University of Toronto.[49] Tesfaye contributed to four songs on Drake's second studio album Take Care, which was released on November 15, as a songwriter, producer and a featured artist on the album's seventh single \"Crew Love\".[60]\nOn May 17, 2013, Tesfaye released the title track to his debut studio album Kiss Land,[78] and announced the album's release date of September 10.[79] Upon release, the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 96,000 copies,[80] and received generally positive reviews from music critics.[81] The album was later supported by the singles \"Belong to the World\", \"Love in the Sky\" and \"Live For\" featuring Drake. Tesfaye embarked on a fall tour from September 6 to November 26.[82] As of August 2015, the album had sold 273,000 copies in the United States.[83]\nOn May 27, 2015, Tesfaye released the second single from Beauty Behind the Madness, \"The Hills\".[92] The single debuted at number twenty on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at number one, becoming Tesfaye's first number-one single. In June 2019, \"The Hills\" was certified diamond by the RIAA, marking Tesfaye's first diamond-certified record.[93][94]\nIn September 2016, Tesfaye announced that his third studio album, Starboy, would be released on November 25, and included collaborations with now-disbanded French electronic music duo Daft Punk.[126][127] He released the album's title track, which featured the duo on September 21.[128] The song debuted at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at number one, making it Tesfaye's third number-one single.[129] As of March 2023, the song is certified Diamond by the RIAA.[130] Their second collaboration, \"I Feel It Coming\" was released on November 24. The single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100.[131] On October 1, Tesfaye made a second appearance on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest alongside actress Margot Robbie. During the show, he performed \"Starboy\" and \"False Alarm\".[132] On November 23, he released the short film M A N I A. Directed by Grant Singer, it featured excerpts from the album, including snippets from \"All I Know\" featuring Future, \"Sidewalks\" featuring Kendrick Lamar, \"Secrets\" and \"Die for You\".[133] Upon release, the album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with 348,000 units, making it Tesfaye's second consecutive number-one album.[134] As of January 2019, the album is certified triple platinum by the RIAA.[135] The album won Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, making it Tesfaye's second win in the category.[136]\nOn February 2, 2018, Tesfaye contributed to the soundtrack for Black Panther on the song \"Pray for Me\" with Kendrick Lamar. The track served as the third single from the soundtrack, and peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[141][142]\nOn November 24, 2019, Tesfaye teased his single \"Blinding Lights\" through a Mercedes-Benz commercial.[157] On November 27, he released \"Heartless\" as the lead single from his fourth studio album. The song debuted at number thirty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number one, making it Tesfaye's fourth number-one single.[158][159] \"Blinding Lights\" was released two days after the release of \"Heartless\" on November 29. The single debuted at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number one, making it Tesfaye's fifth number-one single.[160] \"Blinding Lights\" would then go on to become the first song in the chart's history to hold a spot in the top ten for an entire year.[161] It also became the longest charting song on the Hot 100 of all-time at 90 weeks, ending the week of September 11, 2021.[162][163] On November 23, 2021, \"Blinding Lights\" was ranked as the #1 Greatest Hot 100 Hit of All Time by Billboard, surpassing \"The Twist\" by Chubby Checker.[164] On January 1, 2023 it became the most streamed song on Spotify with 3.3 billion streams.[165]\nOn February 19, 2020, Tesfaye revealed that his fourth studio album would be titled After Hours, and would be released on March 20. He also released the album's title track as a promotional single.[166] On March 7, he made his third appearance as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, alongside actor Daniel Craig. On the show, he performed \"Blinding Lights\" and debuted the track \"Scared to Live\".[167] Tesfaye released the album's third single \"In Your Eyes\" on March 24. The track peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100.[168]\nUpon release,[169]After Hours debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 444,000 units, marking Tesfaye's fourth consecutive number-one album.[170] It became the most streamed R&B album of all-time, surpassing Tesfaye's own Starboy.[171][9] In the album's first charting week, Tesfaye also became the first artist to lead the Billboard 200, Billboard Hot 100, Billboard Artist 100, Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts simultaneously, and repeated his lead the following week.[172][173] The deluxe version of After Hours was released on March 29, 2020, and contained the tracks \"Nothing Compares\", \"Missed You\" and \"Final Lullaby\".[174]\nOn February 5, 2021, Tesfaye released his second greatest hits album The Highlights. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, making it Tesfaye's highest charting compilation album and the biggest first week debut for a greatest hits album since Fully Loaded: God's Country (2019).[181]\nIn March 2021, Tesfaye reissued his debut mixtape House of Balloons in its authentic form with the original mixes and samples to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release.[196] In a collaboration with architect Daniel Arsham, limited edition merchandise was also released alongside the reissue. Six months later, in August, Tesfaye reissued his second 2011 mixtape Thursday to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release.[197] Like House of Balloons, limited edition merchandise was released to accompany the reissue, designed by artist Mr. Yanen.[198] Four months later, in December, Tesfaye reissued his final 2011 mixtape Echoes of Silence to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release.[199] Following the earlier two mixtapes, limited edition merchandise was released alongside the reissue, designed by illustrator Hajime Sorayama.[200] Tesfaye began to tease new music in May 2021. When asked about a new album during an interview with Variety, he explained that \"if the last record is the After Hours of the night, then The Dawn is coming\".[201] On May 11, Tesfaye performed \"Save Your Tears\" at the Brit Awards. He also accepted his first Brit Award for International Male Solo Artist, which was presented to him by former first lady of the United StatesMichelle Obama.[202][203] On May 24, Tesfaye performed \"Save Your Tears\" at the Billboard Music Awards. He was nominated for a record sixteen awards, and won ten, including Top Artist and Top Hot 100 Song. When accepting his awards, Tesfaye continued to tease new music by saying \"the After Hours are done, and The Dawn is coming\".[204] On May 28, he performed the remix of \"Save Your Tears\" at the iHeartRadio Music Awards with Ariana Grande. On June 25, Tesfaye appeared on Doja Cat's single \"You Right\" from her third studio album Planet Her.[205] On July 22, he appeared on Belly's single \"Better Believe\" with Young Thug from his third studio album See You Next Wednesday.[206]\nOn October 4, 2021, during an episode of Memento Mori, Tesfaye revealed that his fifth studio album was complete and that he was waiting on a \"couple characters that are key to the narrative.\"[213] On October 18, Tesfaye announced that his upcoming tour, originally titled the After Hours Tour, would be held entirely in stadiums due to arena constraints and was scheduled to commence in July 2022.[214] The tour was renamed as the After Hours til Dawn Tour, and would incorporate elements from his fourth and fifth studio albums.[215][216]\nTesfaye released his fifth studio album Dawn FM on January 7, 2022.[226] Upon release, the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 148,000 units, marking Tesfaye's eighth top ten entry and his second non-consecutive album to debut at number two.[227][228] He also broke the record for the most simultaneous entries for a male soloist on the Billboard Global 200, with twenty-four songs on the chart.[229][230] In addition to \"Take My Breath\", Dawn FM was supported by the singles \"Sacrifice\" and \"Out of Time\".[231][232] February 26, Tesfaye premiered The Dawn FM Experience, a television music special in partnership with Amazon Prime Video.[233]\nOn February 24, 2023, following months-long renewed interest in and virality of the Weeknd's 2016 song \"Die for You,\" which began charting in 2022 and reached a new peak of 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 6 years after its release, a remix of the song featuring Ariana Grande was released. The remix marked their fourth collaboration.[238][239] In the Billboard Hot 100 issue dated March 11, 2023, the remix reached the top of the chart, becoming both artists' seventh number one hit.[240] On February 27, 2023, in the wake of the remix's success, the Weeknd became the first artist to surpass 100 million monthly listeners on Spotify.[241]\nOn March 3, 2023, the Weeknd released his first live album, titled Live at SoFi Stadium.[242] It featured recordings from his HBO concert film of the same name, showcasing the last concert of the North American leg of his After Hours til Dawn Tour at SoFi Stadium. He subsequently featured on four songs \u2014 \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"Defame Moi,\" \"More Coke!!,\" and \"Emotionless\" \u2014 from Mike Dean's album 4:23, released on April 29, 2023. In May 2023, the Weeknd stated that he was intending to retire the moniker of \"the Weeknd\" in favor of performing under his birth name, or adopting a new pseudonym altogether. He explained that his upcoming album would most likely serve as his \"final hurrah\" under the name.[243]\nThe Weeknd co-created the HBO drama series The Idol with Sam Levinson, and stars in the show alongside Lily-Rose Depp. The series premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival out of competition, where it received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of onscreen nudity and sexual content. The series debuted to widespread negative reviews from critics. The Hollywood Reporter stated that the series confirms the allegations that \"Instead of subtly skewering the misogynistic and predatory nature of the business, The Idol became a forbidden love story \u2014 the stuff of a toxic man\u2019s fantasy\", and called it \"regressive rather than transgressive\".[244] He received negative reviews for his acting, with critic Robert Daniels of The Playlist writing, \"Tesfaye is also a terrible actor. He lacks the comfortability, the gravitas, charisma, and charm to increase the viability of Jocelyn being attracted to him. In most scenes, Tesfaye either hides under the cover of dim lighting, obtrusive coverage, or re-recorded dialogue dubbed into several scenes.\"[245] On August 28, 2023, HBO announced it had cancelled The Idol after one season.[246]\nHis emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex,[262] drugs, and partying; this is seen especially in After Hours and House of Balloons.[23] Hermione Hoby of The Guardian characterizes Tesfaye's songs as \"narcotised-slow jams\" and delineates their message as \"partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling.\"[262] Paul MacInnes of The Guardian stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as \"a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover.\"[266] Anupa Mistry of the Toronto Standard observes throughout his mixtapes a \"cast of supine, stoned zombie-women... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable.\"[23] Tesfaye has stated that by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is \"paying homage to R Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent.\"[267]\nTesfaye often sings in a falsetto register,[268] exhibiting an enticing tone. J. D. Considine finds his singing's \"tremulous quality\" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's \"strong basis in the blues\" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma.[264] Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G\u266f (G\u266f5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave.[269][270] Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave.[270] Tesfaye's vocals have a recognizable Ethiopian characteristic. Hannah Giogis of Pitchfork notes that \"his trademark vibrato, the characteristically pained whine that pervades much of Tesfaye's music, draws from a long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining. Imbuing our voices with the shaky pain of loss\u2014romantic or otherwise\u2014is a hallmark of Ethiopian musical tradition. Tesfaye, with his staccato wails and aching nostalgia, is a young, North American addition to a dynasty of melodramatic Ethiopian singers.\"[271] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked the Weeknd at number 110 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[272]\nTesfaye's discography spans pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, alternative, and new wave genres.[273] His work is generally categorized as alternative R&B, due to his contributions in broadening the genre's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles.[274][69] Mistry writes that he \"will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B music\u2014because Tesfaye is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B.\"[23] Tesfaye shared his thoughts on the primary label during an interview with Time in 2015, stating: \"Alternative R&B is in my soul. It's not going anywhere. When I put out songs from House of Balloons in 2010, people said I made R&B cool again. I'm assuming that's when the label was created. I feel honored that a good part of today's music is inspired by it, consciously or subconsciously. The only way I could have done that was to be ambitious and grand.\"[275] Tesfaye's first three mixtapes; House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence, are alternative R&B projects that draw on dream pop, post-punk and trip hop, amongst others.[276][277] His debut studio album Kiss Land is categorized as R&B and dark wave.[278] His next three albums, Beauty Behind the Madness, Starboy and After Hours, are considered R&B and pop; with Starboy utilizing heavy trap influences,[279][280] and After Hours drawing on new wave and dream pop influences.[281][282] Tesfaye's fifth studio album Dawn FM explores dance-pop and synth-pop genres.[283][284]\nIn December 2015, Tesfaye was sued by Cutting Edge Music, which alleged that the bassline for \"The Hills\" had been taken from a composition featured in the score for the 2013 science fiction film The Machine.[285] One of the producers of the song was alleged to have sent a private Twitter message to Tom Raybould, the composer of the film's score, to tell him about the sample.[286] In September 2018, Tesfaye and Daft Punk were sued for allegedly stealing the rhythm for \"Starboy\" from Ethiopian poet and singer-songwriter Yasminah.[287] Tesfaye denied the allegations.[288]\nIn April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover, and Scott McCulloch, who accused Tesfaye of copyright infringement from plagiarising their song \"I Need to Love\" in order to create his song \"A Lonely Night\". They sought $150,000 from Tesfaye and Belly. In August 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed via summary judgment with the option to amend, with the court ruling that they had failed to show that Tesfaye or anyone else involved in making \"A Lonely Night\" had access to their song or that the works were substantially similar.[289] In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended claim based on secondary infringement, which is still in litigation.[290][291]\nIn February 2020, Tesfaye and Kendrick Lamar were sued by the now-defunct indie band Yeasayer, claiming that \"Pray for Me\" includes an unauthorized sample of their song \"Sunrise\".[292] Later that year, Yeasayer voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit.[293] In September 2021, Tesfaye, Nicol\u00e1s Jaar, and Frank Dukes were sued for copyright infringement by producers Suniel Fox and Henry Strange, protesting that \"Call Out My Name\" is \"strikingly [or] substantially similar, if not identical\" to their 2015 track \"Vibeking\".[294][295]\nOn March 1, 2023, Rolling Stone released a lengthy expos\u00e9 on the working conditions and set life of the HBO drama series The Idol, a series in which Tesfaye stars, co-created and co-wrote alongside Sam Levinson. The series received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of sexual content which critics labeled \"torture porn\". The series was originally directed by Amy Seimetz who suddenly \"exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished\". The series then overwent a major creative overhaul. It was reported that Tesfaye felt the show had too much of a \"female perspective\". Over 14 crew members alleged a toxic work environment with one adding \"What I signed up for was a dark satire of fame and the fame model in the 21st century...\" however, \"It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.\" Sources alleged that Seimetz\u2019s approach to the story was scrapped and the show became \"like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show \u2014 and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better\".[300]\nIn response to the allegations, Tesfaye mocked the reporting on his Twitter account, posting a clip of the characters in the show discussing the magazine saying, \"Rolling Stone? Aren't they a little irrelevant?\". Tesfaye posted the comment in the caption: \"@Rolling Stone did we upset you?\".[301][302] Tesfaye's response received widespread criticism.[303] In an interview with Vanity Fair, he continued to dismiss the reporting, saying that logistical difficulties with Seimetz's schedule and production timelines, as well as a desire not to rush his first show, propelled the overhaul.[304]\nOn June 29, 2021, Tesfaye announced that he would be co-creating, co-writing, executive producing and starring in the HBO television drama series The Idol, alongside his producing partner Reza Fahim and Euphoria creator Sam Levinson.[311] On March 20, 2022, Tesfaye voiced two characters during an episode of The Simpsons.[312]\nIn 2017, Tesfaye partnered with retail company H&M for their men's collection.[322] He cut ties with the company in 2018, following a racist incident within the company.[323] In July 2018, Tesfaye collaborated with Marvel Comics to release a comic book inspired by his third studio album Starboy.[324] In August, he released an apparel collection in collaboration with A Bathing Ape.[325][326] A second collection was released in January 2020.[327]\nOn August 31, 2020, Tesfaye partnered with TD Bank to launch Black HXOUSE, an entrepreneurial initiative within the incubator HXOUSE, where he serves as a sleeping partner.[329] On September 9, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a CA$221,000,000 joint venture with HXOUSE for Black Canadian entrepreneurs.[330]\nIn June 2017, Tesfaye donated US$100,000 to the Suubi Health Center, a maternity and children's medical facility in Budondo, Uganda. He was inspired to support the center after learning of French Montana's work with Global Citizen and Mama Hope to help raise awareness for Suubi and the people of Uganda.[338]\nOn August 7, 2020, Tesfaye held the \"Weeknd Experience\", an interactive virtual concert on the social media platform TikTok that drew two million total viewers, including 275,000 concurrent viewers. The concert raised over US$350,000 for the Equal Justice Initiative. He also donated US$300,000 to Global Aid for Lebanon in support of victims of the Beirut explosion.[346][347] On November 2, the University of Toronto announced that it was able to reach and surpass its fundraising goal of CA$500,000 for its Ethiopic program, which included a CA$30,000 donation from Tesfaye.[348] In May 2021, he was among the celebrities expressing more solidarity for civilians who died during the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis.[349][350] On September 23, Tesfaye was honored with the Quincy Jones Humanitarian Award at the inaugural Music in Action Awards, presented by the Black Music Action Coalition.[351]\nTesfaye is known to be very private, and prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye.[357][358] In the beginning of his career, he refrained from participating in interviews and instead chose to communicate via Twitter, which he attributed to shyness and insecurities.[359] To this day, he is still adamant about not participating in interviews, only agreeing to be interviewed in rare situations.[360]\nTesfaye's hairstyle, which has been described as one of his most recognizable traits, has been claimed to be partly inspired by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.[24][370] He began growing it out in 2011 and remarked at how easy it was to maintain with \"a hard shampoo every once in a while\".[24] He cut his hair in 2016, prior to the release of Starboy.[371] On social media, Tesfaye typically suffixed his first name with \"xo\",[372] which is often used as an emoticon for hugs and kisses.[372] According to The Guardian'sHermione Hoby, this was his intention, though others believe it was a reference to his recreational use of ecstasy and oxycodone.[373][374] He later altered the handles on his social media to reflect his stage name in preparation for the release of Starboy.[375]\nIn October 2014, Tesfaye was awarded the Allan Slaight Honour by Canada's Walk of Fame for \"making a positive impact in the fields of music, film, literature, visual or performing arts, sports, innovation or philanthropy\".[389]\n^Ethiopians do not use surnames but rather their father's first name as their family name. Makonnen would traditionally be his family name and Tesfaye would be his grandfather's name.\n^Tesfaye's biological parents were never married. When Tesfaye made a donation to the University of Toronto's Ethiopic program in November 2020, the full name of his mother was revealed as Samrawit Hailu.[22]\n^During his early performances in 2011, respective tours in 2012 and 2013 prior to the Kiss Land Fall Tour, he had other guitar, bass, and keyboard players, as well as two female backup singers; these former members' names are unknown.\n^Jones was absent during the European and Latin American legs of the After Hours til Dawn Tour (2023).\n^Wimmer, Micah (March 21, 2018). \"On the Weeknd, House of Balloons, and Its Massive Influence\".

        "context": "\nThis is a list of the largest deficits overcome to win NFL games, from either the regular season or the postseason. Wins after trailing by 25 points or more have been rare in NFL history, with only nine in over 100 years, including four in the postseason. There have also been two ties after trailing by such a deficit. Comebacks from exactly 24 points behind have been relatively common, with seventeen occurrences (two in the playoffs).[1]\nQuarterback Matt Ryan started on both the losing Falcons team in Super Bowl LI and the beaten Colts team in 2022. By contrast, head coach Marv Levy led the Bills to two of the three biggest comebacks of the 20th century.[2]\nThe current NFL record. Minnesota gave up return touchdowns from a blocked punt and an interception and trailed 33\u20130 at halftime. Between 8:22 to play in the 3rd quarter and 2:15 to play in the 4th quarter the Vikings outscored Indianapolis 36\u20133; they scored five touchdowns in the space of seven possessions. In overtime, Minnesota drove 60 yards and Greg Joseph won the game on a 40-yard field goal with 3 seconds left in the extra period.\nPlayoff record. Backup quarterback Frank Reich led the Bills to four touchdowns between 8:52 and 2:00 of the 3rd quarter to begin the comeback. Buffalo took the lead on Andre Reed's third touchdown catch with 3:08 to play, before the Oilers forced overtime with a field goal. Nate Odomes intercepted a Warren Moon pass early in overtime and Steve Christie won the game with a 32-yard field goal. Popularly known as \"The Comeback.\"\nThe largest comeback not requiring overtime. Starting with 11:47 remaining in the 3rd quarter, Indianapolis scored five touchdowns while conceding only two field goals. After the Colts took the lead with 4:21 remaining, Kansas City drove into Colts territory before turning the ball over on downs. Indianapolis quarterback Andrew Luck threw for four touchdowns on the day and scored another on a fumble recovery.\nAfter trailing by 28 points at halftime, San Francisco scored four unanswered touchdowns in the second half and tied the score with 1:50 to play. After forcing a New Orleans punt on the first possession of overtime, the 49ers drove for Ray Wersching's game-winning field goal.\nAfter throwing four interceptions, the Jaguars found themselves in a 27\u20130 deficit approaching halftime. Starting with a touchdown with :28 left in the 2nd quarter, Jacksonville then outscored the Chargers 31\u20133 for the rest of the game. The Jaguars successfully converted a two-point conversion after scoring a touchdown, cutting the lead to 2 points with 5:40 to play in the 4th quarter. After forcing a Chargers punt, the Jaguars drove for Riley Patterson's 36-yard winning field goal.\nBetween 2:12 to play in the 2nd quarter and 1:14 to play in the 4th quarter, Buffalo outscored Indianapolis 37\u20133. Trailing by eight points, the Colts drove for a late touchdown but failed on a game-tying two-point conversion attempt.\nSuper Bowl record. Starting with 2:06 to play in the 3rd quarter, New England scored 25 unanswered points from four offensive drives. They tied the game with 57 seconds remaining in regulation, then won it with a touchdown on the first drive of overtime.\nLargest comeback by the away team. The Titans ran no further plays in Cleveland territory after taking their 25-point lead in the 2nd quarter. Cleveland scored 26 unanswered points, beginning 12 seconds before halftime and finishing with 1:09 left in the game.\nThe largest 4th-quarter comeback. Starting with 12:42 remaining in the game, St. Louis scored 28 unanswered points to take the lead with 2:01 to play. A 53-yard field goal attempt by Buccaneers kicker Donald Igwebuike struck the crossbar as time expired.\nBeginning with approximately two minutes to play in the 3rd quarter, and finishing with fewer than 30 seconds to play, the Rams scored four unanswered touchdowns. Philadelphia missed a potential game-winning 52-yard field goal as time expired. No overtime was played.[a]",

A member of the Workers' Party, he previously served as the 35th president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010.[2]\nDescribed as left-wing,[4][5][6] his first presidency, which coincided with the first pink tide in the region, was marked by the consolidation of social welfare programs such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia and Fome Zero, which propelled Brazil to leave the United Nations' Hunger Map.[7] During his two terms in office, he undertook radical reforms in the country, which eventually led to growth in GDP, reduction in public debt and inflation, and helping 20 million Brazilians escape poverty.[8] Poverty, inequality, illiteracy, unemployment, infant mortality, and child labor rates fell significantly, while the minimum wage and average income increased, and access to school, university, and health care was expanded. He also played a prominent role in foreign policy, both on a regional level (as part of the BRICS) and as part of global trade and environmental negotiations.[9] Lula was considered one of the most popular politicians in the history of Brazil, and was one of the most popular in the world while president.[10][11][12] Although popular, his first term was marked by notable scandals, such as the Mensal\u00e3o scandal and Esc\u00e2ndalo dos sanguessugas [pt]. After the 2010 Brazilian general election, he was succeeded by his former Chief of Staff, Dilma Rousseff.[13]\nAfter his first presidency, Lula remained active in politics, and began giving lectures in Brazil and abroad. In 2016, he was appointed as Rousseff's Chief of Staff, but the appointment was suspended by the Supreme Federal Court.[14][15] In July 2017, Lula was convicted on charges of money laundering and corruption in a controversial trial that was later nullified in April 2021 by the Supreme Court Justices, due to the court lacking proper jurisdiction over his case.[16][17] Lula attempted to run in the 2018 Brazilian presidential election but was disqualified under Brazil's Ficha Limpa law.[18] Before the annulment of his cases, he was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison, and after an unsuccessful appeal, Lula was arrested in April 2018 and spent 580 days in jail, until being released in November 2019, when the Supreme Federal Court ruled that his imprisonment was unlawful.[19][20][21][22] In March 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal judge presiding over the case, Sergio Moro, who served as Minister of Justice and Public Security in the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro,[23] was biased,[24] and all of the cases Moro had brought against Lula were annulled in June 2021. Following the court ruling, Lula was legally allowed to make another run for president in the 2022 elections, defeating Bolsonaro in the runoff.[25] He became the first Brazilian president to have been elected to a third term, and the first to have defeated an incumbent president in an election. At age 77, he was sworn in on 1 January 2023, as the oldest Brazilian president at the time of inauguration.[26][27][4] A week later, the Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes was attacked in an invasion led by pro-Bolsonaro rioters; Lula condemned the attack.\nLuiz In\u00e1cio da Silva was born on 27 October 1945 (registered with a date of birth of 6 October 1945) in Caet\u00e9s (then a district of Garanhuns), located 250 km (150 miles) from Recife, capital of Pernambuco, a state in the Northeast of Brazil. He was the seventh of eight children of Aristides In\u00e1cio da Silva and Eur\u00eddice Ferreira de Melo, a couple of farmers who experienced the famine in one of the poorest parts of the agreste.[28] Two weeks after Lula's birth, his father moved to Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo, with Valdomira Ferreira de G\u00f3is, a cousin of Eur\u00eddice. He was raised Roman Catholic.[29] Lula's mother was of Portuguese and partial Italian descent.[30]\nIn December 1952, when Lula was seven years old, his mother moved the family to S\u00e3o Paulo to rejoin her husband. After a journey of 13 days in a pau-de-arara (open truck bed), they arrived in Guaruj\u00e1 and discovered that Aristides had formed a second family with Valdomira. Aristides's two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, Eur\u00eddice moved with her children to a small room behind a bar in S\u00e3o Paulo. After that, Lula rarely saw his father, who died an alcoholic in 1978.[31]\nLula has been married three times. In 1969, he married Maria de Lourdes, who died of hepatitis in 1971 while pregnant with their first son, who also died.[32] In 1974, Lula had a daughter, Lurian, with his then girlfriend, Miriam Cordeiro. The two were never married, and he only began participating in his daughter's life when she was already a young adult.[33] In 1974, Lula married Marisa Let\u00edcia Rocco Casa, a widow, with whom he then had three sons. He also adopted Marisa's son from her first marriage. Lula and Marisa remained married for 43 years, until her death on 2 February 2017 after a stroke.[34] Still in 2017, he met and started a relationship with Ros\u00e2ngela da Silva, known as Janja, but it only became public in 2019 while he was serving time in jail in Curitiba, Paran\u00e1, due to corruption charges that were later dropped.[35] Lula and Janja married on 18 May 2022.[36]\nLula has had little formal education. He did not learn to read until he was ten years old[37] and quit school after the second grade to work and help his family. His first job at age 8 was still in Guaruj\u00e1 as a street vendor.[3] When he was 12, he worked as shoeshiner and street vendor in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1960, when he was 14, he got his first formal job in a warehouse.[38]\nLula da Silva lost part of his left little finger in a work-related accident when he was a metalworker in the late 1960s\nIn 1961, he started working as an apprentice of press operator while studying in a vocational course in a metallurgical industry that produced screws. In this period, Lula had his first contact with strike movements.[39] After the movement failed in the negotiations, Lula left the company for another metallurgical industry. There, age 19, he lost his left pinkie finger in an accident, while working as a press operator in the factory.[37] After the accident, he had to run to several hospitals before he received medical attention. This experience increased his interest in participating in the Workers' Union. Around that time, he became involved in union activities and held several important union posts.[38][40]\nInspired by his brother Frei Chico, Lula joined the labour movement when he worked at Villares Metals S.A [pt], rising steadily through the ranks. He was elected in 1975, and reelected in 1978, as president of the Steel Workers' Union of S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo and Diadema. Both cities are located in the ABCD Region, home to most of Brazil's automobile manufacturing facilities, including Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and others, and are among the most industrialized in the country. In the late 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, Lula helped organize union activities, including major strikes. Labour courts found the strikes illegal, and Lula was jailed for a month. Due to this, and like other people imprisoned for political activities under the military government, Lula was awarded a lifetime pension after the fall of the military regime.[41]\nOn 10 February 1980, a group of academics, intellectuals, and union leaders, including Lula, founded the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) or Workers' Party, a left-wing party with progressive ideas created in the midst of Brazil's military government.\nIn 1982, he added the nickname Lula to his legal name.[42] In 1983, he helped found the Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores (CUT) union association. In 1984, PT and Lula joined the popular Diretas J\u00e1! (Direct [Elections] Now!) campaign, demanding a direct popular vote for the next Brazilian presidential election. According to the 1967 constitution, Presidents were at that time elected by both Houses of Congress in joint session, with representatives of all State Legislatures; this was widely recognised as a mere sham as, since the March 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat, each \"elected\" President had been a retired general chosen in a closed military caucus. Lula and the PT supported the public demand for a change in the electoral system. But the campaign was defeated by a vote in Congress that rejected an amendment calling direct elections for the following year, and, in 1985, a civilian president, Tancredo Neves, was elected by the same indirect procedure, with Lula's support. Only four years later, as a direct result of Diretas J\u00e1! and after years of popular struggle, the 1989 elections were the first in 29 years to elect a president by direct popular vote.\nLula first ran for office in 1982, for the state government of S\u00e3o Paulo, and lost. In the 1986 elections, Lula won a seat in Congress with the most votes nationwide.[43] The Workers' Party helped write the country's post-military government Constitution, ensuring strong constitutional guarantees for workers' rights, but failed to achieve a proposed push for agrarian reform in the Constitutional text. Under Lula's leadership, the PT took a stance against the Constitution in the 1988 Constituent Assembly, reluctantly agreeing to sign the agreed draft at a later stage.\nIn 1989, still as a Congressman, Lula ran as the PT candidate in the first democratic elections for president since 1960. Lula and Leonel Brizola, two popular left-wing candidates, were expected to tie for first place. Lula was viewed as the more left-leaning of the two, advocating immediate land reform and a default on the external debt. A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas, quickly amassed support among the nation's elite with a more business-friendly agenda. Collor became popular taking emphatic anti-corruption positions; he eventually beat Lula in the second round of the 1989 elections. In 1992, Collor resigned, under threat of impeachment for his alleged embezzlement of public money.\nLula refused to run for re-election as a Congressman in 1990, busying himself with expanding the Workers' Party organizations around the country. As the political scene in the 1990s came under the sway of the Brazilian real monetary stabilization plan, which ended decades of rampant inflation, former PSDB Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso defeated Lula in 1994 and again, by an even wider margin, in 1998.\nA 2010 article in The Washington Post said that, before winning the presidency, Lula had been a \"strident union organizer known for his bushy beard and Che Guevara T-shirts\".[44] In the 2002 campaign, Lula forswore both his informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Embracing political consultantDuda Mendon\u00e7a's advice to pursue a more media-friendly image, Lula led the field in the first round of the 2002 election, held on 6 October, with a nearly two-to-one margin over PSDB candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra. He then defeated Serra in the runoff, to become the country's first leftist president following the fall of the military dictatorship in Brazil, with 61.3 percent of the vote.[citation needed]\nAt the 1 October 2006 general elections, Lula came within a few thousand votes of being reelected in a single round (to date, Cardoso is the only person to win a first-round victory since the return of direct elections in 1989). He faced a run-off on 29 October and won by a substantial margin over the PSDB's Geraldo Alckmin, albeit with a slightly smaller share of the vote than he'd won in the 2002 runoff (60.83 percent vs 61.3 percent).[45] In an interview published 26 August 2007, he said that he had no intention to seek a constitutional change so that he could run for a third consecutive term; he also said that he wanted \"to reach the end of [his] term in a strong position in order to influence the succession.\"[46]\nIn early September 2018, Brazil's top electoral court banned former president Lula da Silva from running for president on the 2018 general election due to his corruption conviction, in accordance with Lei da Ficha Limpa. Instead, Fernando Haddad ran for president on the Workers Party ticket and was defeated by Jair Bolsonaro, after securing nearly 45 percent of the popular vote in a run-off between the candidates.[47]\nLula served two terms as president from 2003 through 2010 and left office on 1 January 2011. During his farewell speech he said he felt an additional burden to prove that he could handle the presidency despite his humble beginnings. \"If I failed, it would be the workers' class which would be failing; it would be this country's poor who would be proving they did not have what it takes to rule.\"[48]\nLula put social programs at the top of his agenda during the campaigns and after election. From very early on his leading program was to eradicate hunger, following the lead of projects already put into practice by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, but expanded by the new Fome Zero (\"Zero Hunger\") program.[50] The program combined a series of programs with the goal of ending hunger in Brazil through the construction of water cisterns in Brazil's semi-arid region of Sert\u00e3o, countering teenage pregnancy, strengthening family agriculture, distributing a minimum amount of cash to the poor and many other measures.\nLula launched a housing aid program that was far superior in scope to the policies developed until then. More than 15 billion euros were invested in water purification and the urbanization of favelas, and more than 40 billion in housing. As a priority, the government proposed to relocate the poor populations that occupy the \"risk zones\", prone to floods or landslides, and then to extend the electricity network, to launch work to relocate the streets and to improve the precarious housing. The government undertook to democratize access to real estate credit.[51]\nThe largest assistance program was Bolsa Fam\u00edlia (Family Allowance), which was based upon the previous Bolsa Escola (School Allowance), which was conditional on school attendance, first introduced in the city of Campinas by then-mayor Jos\u00e9 Roberto Magalh\u00e3es Teixeira. Not long thereafter, other municipalities and states adopted similar programs. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso later federalized the program in 2001. In 2003, Lula formed Bolsa Fam\u00edlia by combining Bolsa Escola with additional allowances for food and kitchen gas. This was preceded by the creation of a new ministry \u2013 the Ministry of Social Development and Eradication of Hunger. This merger reduced administrative costs and bureaucratic complexity for both the families involved and the administration of the program.\nFome Zero has a government budget and accepts donations from the private sector and international organizations. The Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program has been praised internationally for its achievements, despite internal criticism accusing it of having turned into an electoral weapon.\nAlong with projects such as Fome Zero and Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, another Lula administration flagship program was the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). The PAC had a total budget of 646 billion reais ($367 billion) by 2010, and was the Lula administration's main investment program. It was intended to strengthen Brazil's infrastructure, and consequently to stimulate the private sector and create more jobs. The social and urban infrastructure sector was scheduled to receive 84.2 billion reais ($47.9 billion).\nA number of other social projects were introduced during Lula's first presidency.[53]\nA number of educational initiatives were also launched during Lula's first presidency. A free school meals system was extended to reach 37 million pupils while a programme called \"University for All\" was launched which aimed to provide \"whole or partial remission of student fees for low-income students.\"[54] In 2006, a reform was introduced extending primary education from 8 to 9 years as a means of improving the accessibility of education for the poor. The total length of primary and secondary education in Brazil increased from 11 to 12 years as a result. A Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Basic Education (FUNDEB) was also set up to close the gap between the quality of education in public and private schools. A basic education development index to measure the quality of education in state schools was also introduced, which was based on a school pass rate and on the performance of pupils in a test of knowledge. The PED conditioned the disbursement of public funds to state schools on the schools' performance, and in 200 the government set aside $500 million for the PED and a further $3 billion for the 2008 \u2013 2010 period. The PED was also aimed at high schools and continuing education.[55]\nAs Lula gained strength in the run-up to the 2002 elections, the fear of drastic measures, and comparisons with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, increased internal market speculation. This led to some market hysteria, contributing to a drop in the value of the real, and a downgrade of Brazil's credit rating.[56]\nLula and his cabinet followed, to an extent, the lead of the previous government,[58] by renewing all agreements with the International Monetary Fund, which were signed by the time Argentina defaulted on its own deals in 2001. His government achieved a satisfactory primary budget surplus in the first two years, as required by the IMF agreement, exceeding the target for the third year. In late 2005, the government paid off its debt to the IMF in full, two years ahead of schedule.[59]\nThe Brazilian economy was generally not affected by the mensal\u00e3o scandal, which related to vote buying in the Brazilian Congress.[60] In early 2006, Antonio Palocci resigned as finance minister due to his involvement in an abuse of power scandal. Lula then appointed Guido Mantega, a member of the PT and an economist by profession, as finance minister. Mantega, a former Marxist who had written a PhD thesis (in Sociology) on the history of economic ideas in Brazil from a left-wing viewpoint, was known for his criticism of high interest rates, something he claimed satisfied banking interests. Mantega was also supportive of a higher level of employment by the state. Not long after the start of his second term, Lula's government announced the Growth Acceleration Program (Programa de Acelera\u00e7\u00e3o de Crescimento, PAC), an investment program to solve many of the problems that prevented the Brazilian economy from expanding more rapidly. The measures included investment in the creation and repair of roads and railways, simplification and reduction of taxation, and modernization of the country's energy production to avoid further shortages. The money pledged to be spent on this program was considered to be around R$ 500 billion (US $260 billion) over four years. Prior to taking office, Lula had been a critic of privatization. His administration created public-private partnership concessions for seven federal roadways.[61]\nLula's second term was much more confident; Lula was then not only the undisputed object of popular affection, as the first president to bring a modest well-being to many people, but also in complete control of his own administration. His two leading ministers were gone. Palocci was no longer needed to calm the nerves of overseas investors and Lula had never liked and somewhat feared Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, a virtuoso of cold political calculation and intrigue. Their joint elimination freed Lula for sole command in Brasilia. When, midway through his second term its test came, he handled it with aplomb. The crash of Wall Street in 2008 might have been a tsunami in the US and Europe, he declared, but in Brazil it would be no more than a little 'ripple' (\"uma marolinha\"). The phrase was seized on by the Brazilian press as proof of reckless economic ignorance and irresponsibility.[64] In 2008, Brazil enjoyed economic good health to fight the global financial crisis with a large economic stimulus lasting, at least, until 2014.[65] The Lula administration's economic policies also helped to significantly raise living standards, with the percentage of Brazilians belonging to the consumerist middle class rising from 50% to 73% of the population.[citation needed] According to The Washington Post:\nUnder Lula, Brazil became the world's eighth-largest economy, more than 20 million people rose out of acute poverty and Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first time the Games will be held in South America.\nThe deforestation rate in Brazil declined significantly during Lula's time in office, a decline that reversed in the time of Bolsonaro.[66][67]\nIn terms of environmental protection, the creation of conservation areas and indigenous reserves led to a substantial decrease (around 75%) in deforestation starting in 2004.[68]\nInitially, Lula's administration pushed for progressive policies that significantly curbed deforestation in the Amazon. Despite this, he did not support legislation that would have required the country to phase out its fossil fuels.\nDuring his 2022 election campaign, he focused more on environmental issues and espoused more environmentally conscious policies.[69]\nLeading a large and competitive agricultural state, Lula generally opposed and criticized farm subsidies, and this position has been seen as one of the reasons for the walkout of developing nations and subsequent collapse of the Canc\u00fan World Trade Organization talks in 2003 over G8 agricultural subsidies.[70] Brazil played an important role in negotiations regarding internal conflicts in Venezuela and Colombia, and concentrated efforts on strengthening Mercosur.[71] During the Lula administration, Brazilian foreign trade increased dramatically, changing from deficits to several surpluses after 2003. In 2004, the surplus was US$29 billion, due to a substantial increase in global demand for commodities. Brazil also provided UN peace-keeping troops and led a peace-keeping mission in Haiti.[72]\nIn 2003, Lula condemned the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, saying that the United States had no right \"to decide unilaterally what is good and what is bad for the world.\"[73] He said that \"the behaviour of the United States in relation to Iraq has weakened the United Nations.\"[74]\nAccording to The Economist of 2 March 2006, Lula had a pragmatic foreign policy, seeing himself as a negotiator, not an ideologue, a leader adept at reconciling opposites. As a result, he befriended both Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and U.S. President George W. Bush.[75] Lula also gained increasing stature in the Southern hemisphere through economic growth in Brazil. In 2008, he was said to have become a \"point man for healing regional crises\", as in the escalation of tensions between Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. Former Finance Minister, and current advisor, Delfim Netto, said: \"Lula is the ultimate pragmatist.\"[76]\nHe travelled to more than 80 countries during his presidency.[77] A goal of Lula's foreign policy was for the country to gain a seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. In this he was unsuccessful.[77] Lula was considered to have pulled off a major coup with Turkey in regards to getting Iran to send its uranium abroad in contravention of western calls.[77][78]\nThe condemnation of Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani for the crime of adultery, with a sentence of execution by stoning, led to calls for Lula da Silva's intervention on her behalf. On the issue, Lula commented that \"I need to respect the laws of a [foreign] country. If my friendship with the president of Iran and the respect that I have for him is worth something, if this woman has become a nuisance, we will receive her in Brazil.\" The Iranian government declined the offer.[79][80] Lula da Silva's actions and comments sparked controversy. Mina Ahadi, an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed Lula da Silva's offer of asylum for Ashtiani, but also reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requesting a cessation of recognition and support for the Iranian government.[81][82][83][84]Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor of The Washington Post, called Lula da Silva the \"best friend of tyrants in the democratic world\" and criticised his actions.[79]Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate viewed Lula da Silva's intervention in a more positive light, calling it a \"powerful message to the Islamic Republic\".[85] In the final month of his first administration, his government officially recognized Palestine as a state,[86] with a number of Latin American countries following suit.[citation needed]\nLula's administration was plagued by numerous corruption scandals,[87][88] notably the Mensal\u00e3o scandal and Esc\u00e2ndalo dos sanguessugas [pt] in his first term. Brazilian attorney general \u00c1lvaro Augusto Ribeiro Costa presented charges against 40 politicians and officials involved in the Mensal\u00e3o affair, including several charges against Lula himself. Lula stated on Brazilian public television that he knew nothing about the scandals.[89] Top officials involved, such as Roberto Jefferson, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, Luiz Gushiken and Humberto Costa have corroborated this; but one of his own party members, Arlindo Chinaglia, alleged that Lula had been warned about the matter.[90] Having lost numerous government aides in the face of political turmoil, Lula survived largely unscathed in the eyes of the public, with overwhelming approval rates.\nHis administration was heavily criticized for relying on local, right-of-centre political barons, like Jos\u00e9 Sarney, Jader Barbalho, Renan Calheiros and Fernando Collor to ensure a majority in Congress. Another frequent reproach was his ambiguous treatment of the left wing of the PT. Analysts felt that he would occasionally give in to left-wing calls for tighter government control on media and increased state intervention: in 2004, he pushed for the creation of a \"Federal Council of Journalists\" (CFJ) and a \"National Cinema Agency\" (Ancinav), the latter designed to overhaul funding for electronic communications. Both proposals ultimately failed amid concerns over the effect of state control on free speech.[91][92]\nBefore a G-20 summit in London in March 2009, Lula caused an uproar by declaring that the economic crisis was caused by \"the irrational behavior of white people with blue eyes, who before seemed to know everything, and now have shown they don't know anything.\"[93]\nWhen wanted Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on 18 March 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers, Brazilian Minister of Justice Tarso Genro granted him status as a political refugee, a controversial decision which divided Italy and the Brazilian and international press. On 5 February 2009, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of Italy and held a minute's silence in memory of Battisti's victims. On 18 November 2009, the Brazilian Supreme Court declared the refugee status illegal and allowed Battisi's extradition, but also stated that the Brazilian constitution gave the president personal powers to deny the extradition if he chose to, effectively putting the final decision in the hands of Lula.[94] Lula barred Battisti's extradition.[95] On 31 December 2010, Lula's last day in office, the decision not to allow extradition was officially announced. Battisti was released on 9 June 2011 from prison after the Brazilian Constitutional Court denied Italy's request to extradite him. Italy planned to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.[96] Battisti was extradited in December 2018.[97]\nOn 4 March 2016, as part of \"Operation Car Wash\", Brazilian authorities raided Lula's home.[101][102] After the raid, the police detained Lula for questioning.[103][104] A police statement alleged that Lula had collaborated in illegal bribes from the oil company Petrobras to benefit his political party and presidential campaign.[103] Prosecutor Carlos Fernando said, \"The favors to Lula from big construction companies involved in the fraud at Petrobras were many and hard to quantify\".[105] Lula said that he and his party were being politically persecuted.[106][107][108]\nOn 16 March 2016, Rousseff appointed Lula as her chief of staff, a position comparable to that of prime minister. This would have shielded him from arrest due to the immunity that went with the position.[109] Cabinet ministers in Brazil are among close to seven hundred senior government officials enjoying special judicial standing, which means they can only be tried by Brazil's Supreme Federal Court. Supreme Court Judge Gilmar Mendes suspended Lula da Silva's appointment on the grounds that Rousseff was trying to help Lula circumvent prosecution.[110][111]\nOn 14 September 2016, prosecutors filed corruption charges against Lula, accusing him of being the mastermind or 'maximum commander of the scheme'.[112] On 19 September 2016, 13th Circuit (Paran\u00e1) federal judge Sergio Moro, who was leading the corruption probe, accepted an indictment for money laundering against Lula and his wife Marisa Leticia Lula da Silva. On 11 May 2017, Lula answered a summons by appearing in Curitiba and was questioned by Moro. The closed-court hearing lasted five hours. Thousands of Lula supporters went to Curitiba, together with Dilma Rousseff. After the hearing, Lula and Rousseff gave speeches to his supporters; Lula attacked what he called bias in the Brazilian media.[113]\nLula was found guilty by the lower court of accepting R$3.7 million in bribes ($940,000 US) in the form of improvements to his beachfront house, made by construction company Grupo Metha [pt], which in turn received lucrative contracts from the state-owned oil company Petrobras.[114] Lula also faced other charges, including money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice.[115][114] On 12 July 2017, Sergio Moro sentenced Lula to nine and a half years in prison.[116] Lula remained free pending his appeal.[117] Lula's lawyer accused the judge of bias and the judge replied that nobody, not even the former president, should be above the rule of law.[117]\nOn 25 January 2018, the Appeal Court of Porto Alegre found Lula guilty of corruption and money laundering and increased his sentence to 12 years of prison[118] for one of the nine charges, while the other eight were still pending. On 26 March 2018, that same court upheld its own sentence, thus ending the case in that court.[119]\nOn 23 March 2021, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by a 3\u20132 decision that Moro, who had overseen Lula's trial in a case, was biased against him.[24] It upheld the ruling on 23 June by a 7\u20134 decision.[120] Judge Gilmar Mendes of the Supreme Federal Court on 24 June annulled the two other cases Moro had brought against Lula, reasoning that there was a link between them and the case in which Moro was declared biased. This meant that all evidence Moro had collected against Lula is inadmissible in court and fresh trials would be needed.[121]\nOn 5 April 2018, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court (STF) voted 6\u20135 to deny Lula's habeas corpus petition.[122] The court ruled that Lula must begin serving the sentence relating to 12 July 2017 conviction, despite not having exhausted all of his appeals. Lula and his political party vowed to continue his campaign from prison following the court's decision that he must surrender himself by 6 April.[123] The head of Brazil's army, General Eduardo Villas Boas, called for Lula to be placed behind bars.[124] Lula failed to turn himself in at the scheduled time,[125] but he did so on the following day on 7 April 2018.[126] After the imprisonment of Lula, protesters took to the streets in cities across Brazil.[127] Lula's imprisonment led to the formation of the Free Lula Movement.\nOn 8 July 2018, federal judge for the 4th region Rog\u00e9rio Favreto ordered Lula's release. Moro immediately stated that Favreto did not have the power to release Lula and Favreto's ruling was overturned the same day by the Judge Pedro Gebran Neto, president of the 4th regional court.[128]\nOn 9 June 2019, The Intercept published leakedTelegram messages between the judge in Lula's case, Sergio Moro, and the Operation Car Wash lead prosecutor, Deltan Dallagnol, in which they allegedly conspired to convict Lula to prevent his candidacy for the 2018 presidential election.[129][130][131][132][133][134][135] Moro was accused of lacking impartiality in Lula's trial.[136] Following the disclosures, the resumption of legal proceedings was determined by the Supreme Court.[137] Moro denied any wrongdoing or judicial misconduct during the course of Operation Car Wash and his investigation of the former president, claiming that the conversations leaked by The Intercept were misrepresented by the press and that conversations between prosecutors and judges are normal.[138] Moro became Minister of Justice and Public Security after the election of president Jair Bolsonaro, and it is disputed whether an agreement was in place prior to Bolsonaro's election.\nThe information published by The Intercept prompted reactions both in Brazil and overseas. A group of seventeen lawyers, ministers of Justice, and high court members from eight countries reacted to the leaks by describing former President Lula as a political prisoner and calling for his release.[139] United States Senator Bernie Sanders said Lula should be released and his conviction annulled. Ro Khanna asked the Trump administration to investigate Lula's case, saying that \"Moro was a bad actor and part of a larger conspiracy to send Lula to jail\".[140] American political commentator Michael Brooks, a vocal advocate for the former president, stated that Lula's imprisonment and Moro's alleged political motives had rendered the results of the 2018 election \"fundamentally illegitimate\".[141]\nJudge Edson Fachin of the Supreme Federal Court annulled all convictions against Lula on 8 March 2021, ruling that the court in Curitiba which convicted him lacked jurisdiction to do so, and ordered a retrial in Brasilia.[146] A full Supreme Court bench later upheld the ruling by an 8\u20133 decision on 15 April.[147]\nAfter the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court refused to consider alleged violations of fundamental human rights by Judge Moro, Lula's defense lawyers appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Committee.[148] In the lawsuit, the lawyers requested that the Committee provide an opinion on the accusations that Moro violated Lula's right to privacy, his right to not be arbitrarily arrested and his right to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. They presented as proof of abusive practices:\nCoercive conduct against Lula on 4 March 2016.\nThe leaking of confidential data to the press.\nThe leaking of illegally obtained phone conversation recordings to the press.\nAn abusive strategy of temporary and preemptive imprisonments in order to obtain plea-bargaining deals implicating the former president.\nBecause the judge's chief of staff had posted on her Facebook page a petition calling for Lula's imprisonment[149] and the presiding judge of the appellate panel had praised Moro's decision to convict Lula for corruption, before Moro had issued his decision,[150] an op-ed in The New York Times concluded that \"Brazil's democracy is now weaker than it has been since military rule ended\".[151] The newspaper was joined by a number of international intellectuals, activists and political leaders, from Noam Chomsky to a group of twelve United States Congressmen,[152] who complained that the legal proceedings appeared to be designed to prevent Lula (the front-runner in opinion polls) from running for president in 2018.[153][better source needed]\nOn 28 July 2016, Lula filed a 39-page petition with the UN's Human Rights Committee outlining alleged abuses of power. The petition stated that \"Lula is a victim of abuse of power by a judge, with the complicity of prosecutors and the media\".[154] The petition was the first ever taken against Brazil which ratified the committee's protocol in 2009.\nProtests related to 2016 Lula's coercive testimony\nThe UN accepted the case[155] and Brazil was given six months to respond to the petition. The committee was made of 18 international jurists.[156] In November 2016, Lula's legal team filed additional evidence of abuses by the Brazilian justice system,[157] and another document was filed on 5 October 2017, in Geneva, Switzerland, reporting other facts, such as Judge Moro's attendance at the premiere of a film that depicted former President Lula as guilty, despite the lack of any definitive decision against him at that time.[158]\nFollowing Judge Moro's issuance of an arrest warrant for the ex-President, on 6 April 2018, Lula appealed to the UN's Human Rights Committee to ask the government to prevent his arrest until he had exhausted all appeals.[159] Lula argued that the Brazilian Supreme Court had narrowly adopted its ruling with only six votes against five, which \"shows the need for an independent court to examine if the presumption of innocence was violated\" in his case. The Human Rights Committee received a request for \"interim measures\" and was deliberating the request.[160] The UN Human Rights Committee denied the request seeking emergency action against his imprisonment.[161]\nOn 28 May 2018, the Committee initiated a formal investigation into violations against basic judicial guarantees in Lula's case.[162] In August, the UN Human Rights Committee \"requested Brazil to take all necessary measures to ensure that Lula can enjoy and exercise his political rights while in prison, as candidate in the 2018 presidential elections.\"[163][164]\nOn 2 August 2018, Pope Francis received three former allies of Lula in Rome: Celso Amorim, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Carlos Ominami. At the conclusion of the hour-long meeting,[165] Pope Francis was given a copy of Lula's biography The Truth Will Win by Amorim. Later, he addressed a handwritten note to Lula (posted on his Twitter account) with the following text: \"To Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with my blessing, asking him to pray for me, Francisco\".[166] In the same month, President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff, who had previously served as Chief of Staff to President Lula da Silva from 2005 to 2010, confirmed that the Pope also sent her an unofficial letter, the content of which was not disclosed.[167]\nLula, along with his former chief of staff Gilberto Carvalho [pt] and five others, was indicted in a corruption probe as part of Operation Zelotes [pt] regarding payment of R$6 million in bribes (US $1.5 million).\nAccording to prosecutors, they helped pass Provisional Measure 471 (which was later converted into Law 12,218/2010) in 2009 in order to benefit the automotive companies CAOA and MMC.[168] Judge Frederico Botelho de Barros Viana of the 10th Federal Court of Brasilia acquitted all the accused on 21 June 2021, stating that the prosecution could not convincingly demonstrate that the defendants were involved in a criminal conspiracy.[169]\nLula in April 2016Lula with Brazilian politician Fernando Haddad in September 2016\nOn 29 October 2011, through the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital of S\u00e3o Paulo, it was announced that Lula had a malignant tumor in his larynx. He had chemotherapy to counteract the tumor, and on 16 November, his press office released photos of his wife shaving his beard and hair, leaving him bald, although he retained his moustache.[170] It was the first time that he had been seen without his beard since he left office.[171] He was treated with radiation, and the cancer went into remission. Lula announced his recovery in March 2012, as well as his return to politics. Fellow politician Dilma Rousseff, then president of Brazil, welcomed the news.[172] Contrary to rumors, Lula stated in early 2013 that he was not a presidential candidate, supporting Dilma Rousseff for a second term.[173]\nThe appointment raised concerns[from whom?] about his arrest and investigation.[174]\nOn 21 January 2021, Lula said that he tested positive for COVID-19 while participating in the filming of an Oliver Stone documentary in Cuba, five days after arriving on the island. He did not need hospital admission and was able to recover.[175] On 13 March 2021, Lula received his first dose of the CoronaVac vaccine.[176]\nIn 2017, Lula announced he would stand as the Workers' Party candidate for president again in the 2018 election. In September, he led a caravan of supporters which travelled through the states of Brazil, starting with Minas Gerais, whose governor was Lula's political ally Fernando Pimentel.[177] While traveling through the South of Brazil, the caravan became the target of protests. In Paran\u00e1, a campaign bus was shot, and in Rio Grande do Sul, rocks were thrown at pro-Lula militants.[178]\nDespite Lula's imprisonment in April 2018, the Workers' Party kept Lula as the party's presidential candidate. In a poll conducted by Ibope in June 2018, Lula led with 33% of vote intentions, with the PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro polling second with 15%.[179] Lula negotiated a national coalition with the PCdoB and regional alliances with the Socialist Party.[180]\nThe Workers' Party officially nominated Lula as its candidate on 5 August 2018, in S\u00e3o Paulo. Actor S\u00e9rgio Mamberti read a letter written by Lula, who was unable to attend because of his prison sentence. Former S\u00e3o Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad was named as Lula's running mate and intended to represent Lula in events and debates. In the event that Lula were declared ineligible, Haddad would replace Lula as candidate, with Manuela d'\u00c1vila replacing Haddad as the vice presidential candidate.[181]\nIn response to an appeal considering Lula as a political prisoner, the UN Human Rights Committee ruled on 17 August 2018 that it had requested the Brazilian government to allow Lula to exercise his political rights.[182]\nIn a 26 August poll, Lula had 39 percent of vote intentions within one month of the first round. The same opinion polling put Lula ahead of all his challengers in a second round run-off, including the nearest one, PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro, by 52 to 32.[183]\nLula's candidacy was denied by the Superior Electoral Court on 31 August 2018, when the majority of the seven-judge panel voted to bar Lula from running in the presidential race.[184] On 11 September 2018, Lula officially dropped out of the election and was replaced by Fernando Haddad, whom Lula endorsed.[185]\nIn May 2021, Lula stated that he would run for a third term in the October 2022 general election, against the incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro,[186][187][188] with opinion polls at the end of July 2021 suggesting he would comfortably beat Bolsonaro.[188] He was 17% ahead of Bolsonaro in a poll in January 2022.[189]\nIn April 2022, Lula announced that his running mate would be Geraldo Alckmin, a three-term governor of S\u00e3o Paulo state who ran against Lula in the 2006 presidential elections.[190]\nOn 2 October, the vote of the first round, Lula was in first place with 48.43% of the electorate, qualifying for the second round with Bolsonaro, who received 43.20% of the votes. Lula was elected in the second round on 30 October, three days after his seventy-seventh birthday. He became the first president of Brazil elected to three terms and the first since Get\u00falio Vargas to serve in non-consecutive terms. He is also the first candidate to unseat an incumbent president. He was sworn in on 1 January 2023.[191][192]\nLula and US President Joe Biden at the White House on 10 February 2023Lula and the Chinese President Xi Jinping, April 2023\nLula said that his main commitments were: the reconstruction of the country in the face of the economic crisis; democracy, sovereignty and peace; economic development and stability; fighting poverty; education; implementation of a National System of Culture and the expansion of housing programs.[193]\nLula took a non-aligned stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, describing it in a way that Ukraine compared to a \"Russian attempt to distort the truth\".[194][195] While highlighting the human cost of the war, as well as its impact on food security,[196]cost of living and global supply chains,[197] and condemning the invasion, Lula repeatedly attacked NATO and the European Union as the cause of the war, accusing the former of \"claiming for itself the right to install military bases in the vicinity of another country.\"[198] In April 2023 Lula condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and said Russia should withdraw from Ukrainian territory it has occupied since February 2022.[199] Refusing to send arms to Ukraine, he also put blame on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying \"This guy is as responsible as Putin for the war,\" during an interview in May 2022.[198] Later in April 2023, he suggested that Ukraine should \"give up Crimea\" in exchange for peace and Russia's withdrawal from Ukrainian territory it occupied after February 2022, saying Zelenskyy \"can not want everything\".[200][201]\nIn April 2023, Lula declared after a state visit to China that \"the United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace\". U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby responded by accusing Lula of \"parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda\", describing his comments as \"simply misguided\" and \"suggesting the United States and Europe are somehow not interested in peace, or that we share responsibility for the war\".[204]\nLula condemned the Hamas attack on Israel carried out on 7 October 2023.[207] On 11 October 2023, he called for a ceasefire in the Israel\u2013Hamas war, stating, it was \"urgently needed in defense of Israeli and Palestinian children\".[208] Lula urged Hamas to release kidnapped Israeli children and Israel to stop bombing the Gaza Strip and allow Palestinian children and their mothers to leave the war zone.[209] On 25 October 2023, Lula stated, \"It's not a war, it's a genocide.\"[210]\nIn March 2023 Lula reinforced the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program. The program was created during the first term of Lula and then significantly cut by Jair Bolsonaro. The program should help around 60 million Brazilians suffering from poverty. The first goal is to eradicate hunger affecting 33.1 million people in Brazil.[211] According to the World Bank estimates, the reinforced program will reduce the poverty rate in Brazil to 24.3% - the level before COVID-19 pandemic.[212]\nIn the first quarter of 2023 Brazilian economy grew by 1.9%. In the second quarter by 0.9%, 3 times more than expected, while many of the neighbors of Brazil saw a shrinkage in their economy. The possible reasons of this phenomena include reducing inflation, good harvest, improving credit rating. The economic policy of Lula regarding taxation, spendings, public ownership of some companies probably played a major role in this. Explaining his economic philosophy Lula once said: \"\u201c[Brazilians] need to understand that the money that exists in this country needs to circulate in the hands of many people,\u201d \u201cWe do not want the concentration of wealth. We want more people to have access to credit to make the wheel of the economy turn. The growing economy needs to be distributed.\u201d[213]\nLula has pledged to end illegal logging, with Greenpeace Brazil spokesperson R\u00f4mulo Batista stating that \"[a]ddressing the crisis will require rebuilding the manpower of environmental agencies that were gutted by the far-right populist [Jair Bolsonaro], a process which cannot happen overnight\".[214] In the first 4 months of 2023, Amazon deforestation rate has seen a significant decrease, being reported 40.4% lower in comparison to the same period of 2022. It is unclear if the trend will continue, as the peak of deforestation comes generally in July\u2013September, but experts see it \"as a positive signal\".[215][216]\nIn the first 7 months of 2023 the deforestation rate in the Amazon has fallen by 42% in \"a sharp reversal relative to the trend under the Bolsonaro administration\". In July 2023 the deforestation rate was 66% lower than in July 2022. In the beginning of August Lula will participate in the Belem summit. At the summit, the leaders of the 8 Amazonian nations, are expected to renew the Amazon cooperation treaty.[217] The result, in July is especially important because usually the clearing season begins in this month. The decision of several banks to not give credit to loggers and the new policy of the EU to achieve \"deforestation-free trade\" helped to achieve this result.[218] However, there are concerns that illegal loggers have partly moved their action from the Amazon rainforest to Cerrado where the environmental destruction has increased.[219] In the first 8 months of 2023 deforestation rate declined by 48% what prevented the release of 196 million tons CO2 to the atmosphere. Financing from the Amazon Fund and cooperation between the Amazonian nations played a significant role in it.[220]\nLula pledged to recognize 14 new indigenous reserves. Six were recognized as of May 2023.[221] Lula and the American president Joe Biden committed to work together on the issue.[222] In April Biden pledged to give 500 million dollars to the Amazon Fund which was frozen during the rule of Bolsonaro and became active when Lula returned to power, as a \"part of the two nations' efforts to deal with climate change.\"[223] According to John Kerry, the overall financial help from US to Brazil for stopping deforestation through different channels will be around 2 billion US dollars.[224]\nIn June, Lula presented a road map for achieving zero deforestation by the year 2030. It is a part of a bigger plan: \"The Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon\". This plan was largely responsible for the 83% decrease in the Amazon deforestation rate in the years 2004 through 2012 but it was suspended during Bolsonaro's presidency. The plan includes different measures for creating a sustainable economy in the Amazon region, like bioeconomy, rural credits and more. Lula also pledged to return the climate targets of the country in the Paris agreement to the level they were before Bolsonaro government: \"reduce carbon emission by 37% by 2025 and 43% by 2030\".[225]\nThe series The Mechanism on Netflix deals with Operation Car Wash and features a character that alludes to Lula, Jo\u00e3o Higino, played by Arthur Kohl.[277]\nThe 2019 documentary The Edge of Democracy, written and directed by Petra Costa, chronicled the rise and fall of Lula and Dilma Rousseff and the socio-political upheaval in Brazil during the period.[278]\n^M\u00e1rio Maestri, ed.

        "context": "\nThe plan is part of a strategy to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta's burden as Indonesia's primary hub.[6][7][8] In August 2019, the government announced that while the capital will be moved, $40 billion will be spent on saving Jakarta from sinking in the next decade.[9]\nJakarta was occupied by the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) and the capital was moved to Yogyakarta. The Indonesian government relocated to the city using a train in the middle of the night.\nSukarno and Hatta returned from exile to Yogyakarta. Sjafruddin Prawiranegara officially dissolved the emergency government on 13 July 1949. Yogyakarta continued as the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, which was a state within the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (formed on 27 December 1949). Jakarta served as the federal capital.\nLithograph of Paleis Rijswijk (present-day Istana Negara or State Palace) in the 1880s.\nThe Dutch colonial settlement of Batavia (present-day Jakarta) was established in 1621.[12] Initially, it was a European-styled walled city crisscrossed by Dutch-style canals in a low-lying coastal swamp area. The poor sanitation and weak water drainage system made the city unhealthy, and it was infested with malaria, cholera, and dysentery. In 1808, Daendels decided to quit the by-then dilapidated and unhealthy Old Town. A new town centre was subsequently built further to the south, near the estate of Weltevreden. Batavia thereby became a city with two centres: Kota, as the hub of business, where the offices and warehouses of shipping and trading companies were located; and Weltevreden, the new home for the government, military, and shops. These two centres were connected by the Molenvliet Canal and a road (now Gajah Mada Road) that ran alongside the waterway.[13]\nIn the early 20th century, the Dutch East Indies government decided to relocate the capital from Batavia to Bandung. The idea was to separate the busy trading port and the commercial centre (Batavia) from the new administrative and political centre (Bandung). By the 1920s the plan to transfer the capital to Bandung was underway. As the city began the master plan of a new city, some government buildings, telecommunication (now Telkom Indonesia), railway networks (now Kereta Api Indonesia), a postal system (now Pos Indonesia), defence-military headquarters, and more were constructed and headquartered in Bandung. Some are still here to this day, such as Gedung Sate, which was planned as the government administrative centre of the Dutch East Indies. The plan, however, failed due to the Great Depression and the outbreak of World War II.[2]\nOn 5 March 1942, Batavia fell to the Japanese. The Dutch formally surrendered to the Japanese occupation forces on 9 March 1942, and the colony's rule was transferred to Japan. The city was renamed Jakarta (officially \u30b8\u30e3\u30ab\u30eb\u30bf\u7279\u5225\u5e02 Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi, Special Municipality of Jakarta, under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the collapse of Japan in 1945, the area went through a period of transition and upheaval during the Indonesian national struggle for independence. During the Japanese occupation and from the perspective of the Indonesian nationalists who declared independence on 17 August 1945, the city was once again renamed Jakarta.[14]\nFollowing the surrender of the Japanese, Indonesia declared its independence on 17 August 1945. The proclamation was enacted at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No. 56 (now Jalan Proklamasi), Central Jakarta, with Suwiryo acting as the committee chairman. Suwiryo was recognised as the first mayor of Jakarta Tokubetsu Shi. The position was soon altered to Pemerintah Nasional Kota Jakarta (\"Jakarta City National Administration\"). On 19 September 1945, Sukarno held an Indonesian independence and anti-colonialism/imperialism speech during Rapat Akbar, or grand meeting, at Lapangan Ikada, now the Merdeka Square. The grand meeting would start a period of national revolution in Indonesia.[15]\nDuring the Indonesian struggle for independence (1945\u20131949), prompted by political and military emergencies, the capital of the republic was moved several times, as the seat of the republic in exile during the war. The capital moved from Jakarta to Yogyakarta (1946\u20131948) and then to Bukittinggi (1948\u20131949) as the seat of the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia.[3] In 1949, the national capital of the republic returned to Jakarta.\nMonas stands in the centre of Merdeka Square, in the heart of the national capital of Jakarta. Most of Jakarta's landmarks and monuments were built during the Sukarno era.\nDuring Sukarno's presidency, Jakarta was established and developed as the capital of the new republic. In 1957, Sukarno laid the foundation and street grid layout of Palangkaraya as a new planned capital of Central Kalimantan province. Sukarno however, foresaw the new city as the possible new national capital in the future. The vast available area and its geographic location in the centre of the archipelago was the city's main advantage. Nevertheless, Sukarno seemed to favour Jakarta instead. In the late 1950s to the first half of the 1960s, he filled Jakarta with monuments and statues. Numbers of monumental projects were conceived, planned, and initiated during his administration, including Monumen Nasional, Istiqlal mosque, DPR/MPR Building, and Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also filled Jakarta with nationalistic monuments and statues, including Selamat Datang Monument, Dirgantara Monument at Pancoran, and the West Irian Liberation Monument at Lapangan Banteng. Although many of the projects were completed later, Sukarno is credited for shaping Jakarta's monuments and landmarks. He desired Jakarta to be the beacon of a powerful new nation.[16]\nIn 1966, Jakarta was granted its official status as DKI (Daerah Khusus Ibukota) Djakarta, or the Special Capital Region. It promoted the rate of development of government office buildings and foreign embassies. Jakarta's rapid development created the need for a master plan to regulate Jakarta's growth. Since 1966, Jakarta has steadily grown into a modern metropolis.[17]\nDuring the highly centralised New Order regime of Sukarno's successor Suharto, Jakarta was further established as the political and economic core of the nation. Prompted by rapid development and urbanisation, Jakarta attracted large numbers of new settlers from all over the archipelago, with the majority coming from rural Javanese towns. High-rise buildings sprung up, especially in Jakarta's commercial and financial centres along Thamrin, Sudirman, and Kuningan avenues. As a result, since the 1970s, the population of Jakarta has spiked tremendously and spilled into areas surrounding the capital. The Jabodetabek, or Greater Jakarta, region has become the largest and the most densely populated urban agglomeration in Southeast Asia.\nProposals to move the Indonesian capital from Jakarta to other locations have been discussed since the Sukarno presidency. Massive overpopulation, a lack of urban infrastructures such as public transportation facilities, gridlock traffic, encroachment of urban areas replacing open green spaces, spread of slums within the city, over-extraction of groundwater, and poor water drainage systems have led to Jakarta's ecological degradation. As groundwater was depleted, the city slowly sank lower; parts of Northern Jakarta are below sea level and regularly encounter floods. Jakarta experienced massive floods in 2007 and 2013. In 2010, the debate about the creation of a new capital that would be separated from the urban, economic, and commercial centre of the country continued. Former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono supported the idea to create a new political and administrative centre of Indonesia due to Jakarta's environmental and overpopulation problems.[18][19]\nMonument built to inaugurate the groundbreaking of Palangkaraya by President Sukarno, dated 17 July 1957. This monument is colloquially known locally as the Sukarno Monument.\nTwo major alternative approaches have been raised over the years:[20] One was to move the national capital altogether by creating an entirely new planned city, similar to the relocation of the Brazilian capital from Rio de Janeiro to the planned city of Brasilia in 1960. The other approach was to keep Jakarta as the official capital but to create a separate administrative centre, similar to when Malaysia moved its federal administrative centre to Putrajaya. Suggested locations for the first proposal include:\nPalangkaraya, Central Kalimantan. Since it was established as the capital of Central Kalimantan province in 1957, the first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, outlined a plan to develop Palangkaraya as the future capital of Indonesia.[21] Palangkaraya is far more extensive in area than Jakarta and is safe from the danger of earthquakes and volcanoes, which are common on Java.[22]\nKota Merdeka is a proposed planned city located north of Pangkalan Bun town, West Kotawaringin Regency, Central Kalimantan. Compared to far inland Palangkaraya, Kota Merdeka is located nearer to coastal areas and has better access to the Java Sea.[23]\nPalembang, South Sumatra. The city has historical significance as the former capital of the Srivijaya maritime empire, which symbolises the return of the archipelago's former glory. It is also strategically located near the main maritime route of the Malacca strait, near the other ASEAN capitals of Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.[25]\nIf Jakarta were kept as the official capital, administrative centres would have been moved to other nearby locations. Suggested locations include:\nJonggol, West Java, located about 40 kilometres southeast of Jakarta, and proposed future capital of Indonesia since the New Order.[26]\nKertajati, Majalengka Regency, West Java, located about 200 kilometres east of Jakarta and 40 kilometres west of Cirebon. The proposed planned capital will be connected to the planned new West Java airport, Java railways, and the Trans-Java toll road.[28] The underused airport has been derided as a 'white elephant' during the 2019 presidential elections and policymakers are under pressure to demonstrate utility for the enormous bills related to the project.[29]\nJakarta Bay, North Jakarta. In 2013, Joko Widodo, then Governor of Jakarta, proposed to move the administrative centre of Indonesia to the planned future reclaimed islands in Jakarta Bay. This plan is in line with the planned National Capital Integrated Coastal Development; the new administrative district will be located on a Garuda bird-shaped island planned to be built on Jakarta Bay.[31]\nIn April 2017, the Joko Widodo (Jokowi) administration considered moving the capital from Jakarta. The government planned to finish assessing potential alternative sites for Indonesia's new capital by the end of 2017. According to an official from the Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia (Bappenas), the government was determined to move the Indonesian capital out of Java.[32] In April 2019, it was announced that Jakarta would no longer be the capital of Indonesia in the future, with a 10-year plan to transfer all government offices to a new capital city.[33] The National Development Planning Ministry recommended the three provinces of South, Central, and East Kalimantan as they all met the requirements for a new capital, including being relatively free from earthquakes and volcanoes. Shortly after the plan was announced in April 2017, Jokowi visited two alternative locations in Kalimantan, Bukit Soeharto in East Kalimantan and the Triangle Area near Palangka Raya in Central Kalimantan.[34]\nThe development of Nusantara began in 23 August 2019, Jokowi submitted Presidential Letter No. R-34/Pres/08/2019. The Letter enclosed with 2 enclosures: (1) Presidential Study Report on Capital Relocation, and (2) Request on DPR Support for Capital Relocation.[35]\nOn 26 August 2019, Jokowi announced that the new capital would be partly in the Penajam North Paser Regency and partly in the Kutai Kartanegara Regency, both in East Kalimantan.[36][37] The National Development Planning Ministry announced that the move would cost an estimated Rp466 trillion (US$32.7 billion) and that the government intended to cover 19% of the cost, the remainder coming mainly from public-private partnerships and direct investment by both state-owned enterprises and the private sector.[38] The Indonesian parliament passed the bill on 18 January 2022, with construction not expected to start until after the COVID-19 vaccination campaign completes in March 2022.[39]\nIn early September 2021, the Bill for Capital Relocation completed.[40] On 29 September 2021, Jokowi administration, through the State Secretary and Ministry of National Development Planning, submitted the presidential letter contained an omnibus bill for capital relocation to the People's Representatives Council (DPR).[41] The among many items prescribed in the bill, the bill contained the plan of formation of The Nusantara Capital City Authority (Indonesian: Otorita Ibu Kota Negara Nusantara), special agency responsible to the new capital and answered to the President. The new agency possessed ministry-like qualities due to the office holder is by appointment of president, but with special governing capabilities which make it somewhat similar to a provincial governor.[40][42] It also regulate on how The Capital Authority operates its funding, taxing and retribution management, and managing assets on the new capital.[43]\nDue to the plan being submitted in the middle of Jokowi's second and final term, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR, consist of DPR and DPD) urgently re-issued an amendment to the Constitution of Indonesia, re-establishing its ability to establish the Principles of State Policies (Indonesian: Pokok-Pokok Haluan Negara, PPHN) in order to provide security and sustainability for the project in the long term and thus ensuring its continuation after Jokowi leaves office.[45]\nThen Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing organized a capital city design contest from 3 October to 20 December 2019. The winner, Nagara Rimba Nusa ('Forest Archipelago')[48] by URBAN+ was officially announced on 23 December 2019. The government will collaborate on the design of the winning team with that of the second- and third-placed teams, as well as international designers, to sharpen the final design process up to March or April 2020.[49] Designers from at least 3 countries, namely China, Japan, and the United States had offered to be involved in the design.[50] The name, which had been suggested about 3 months earlier, is aligned with the winner's main concept.[51]\nOn 17 January 2022, the name of the new capital city was revealed to be Nusantara.[52]",

        "context": "\nThe Voice is an American singing reality competition television series broadcast on NBC. It premiered during the spring television cycle on April 26, 2011. Based on the original The Voice of Holland and part of the Voice franchise, it has aired 23 seasons and aims to find unsigned singing talent (solo or duets, professional and amateur) contested by aspiring singers drawn from public auditions. Singers must be at least thirteen years of age to compete.[2]\nEach season begins with the \"Blind Auditions\", where coaches form their team of artists whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The number of artists varies per season, with a set range between 8 and 16 artists. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read \"I want you.\" At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects their coach if more than one coach expresses interest.[6] Introduced in the 14th season is \"Block\", which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestant.\nIn the \"Battle Rounds\", each coach pairs two of their team members to perform together, then chooses one to advance in the competition. Each coach are assisted by different celebrity advisors varies each season. In season one, coaches sit alongside their respective advisors in the battle stage; however, the advisors no longer join the coaches in the battle stage starting season two. In season 23, there are no advisors and its coach assumed the duties for advising the artists alone. Season three introduced \"steals\", allowing each coach to save/select individuals who were eliminated during a battle round by another coach. First seen in the eighth season, artists are either given a walkover or is reassigned to a three-way battle in the event of another artist withdrawing from the competition if each coach sees fit. Saves were also added starting Season 14, which lets a coach prevent someone that they eliminated on their team from going home; in Season 23, Saves are replaced with \"Playoff Pass\" (based on the Battle Pass from the Australian version) which allow one artist to exempt them from participating in the Knockouts and directly advance to the Playoffs (the other artist advancing to the Knockouts as usual).\nThe Knockout Rounds were also introduced in season three (except for seasons six and sixteen). A pair of artists within a team are selected to sing individual performances in succession. They are not told until a few minutes prior to their performances who their partner is. The artists get to choose their own songs in this round, although they continue to get help and advice from their respective coaches, and since season six, a celebrity advisor serving as a mega mentor (except seasons 14 and 22). At the conclusion of the performances, coaches would decide which one of each pair gets to advance to the next round.[6] Similar to the battle rounds, the coaches can steal one eliminated artist from another coach starting with season five. Starting in season 14, coaches can save one eliminated artist from their own team. From season 18 till 20, artists who were saved faced a Four-Way Knockout, with the winner decided through a public vote.[7]\nThe \"Battles, Round 2\" were introduced to replace the Knockout Rounds in season six.[6] Similar to the Knockout Rounds, each singer is paired within their team. One celebrity key adviser also assists all four of the coaches and their teams in preparation of these rounds. Coaches give each Battle pairing a list of songs and each pair must agree on which song to sing.[8] Like the first Battle round, each coach can still decide which of their singers in each pair will advance to the next round, and also allowed one steal.[9]\nIn the sixteenth season, the knockouts were replaced by The Live Cross Battles, a format identical to the Cross Battles from the Chinese version of The Voice. Each coach selects an artist to perform with another coach's artist together. The artist that receives the public vote will move on to the Playoffs, while the losing artist may be eliminated from the competition. The Live Cross Battles did not return in season seventeen due to poor reception.[10]\nPreviously eliminated artists can also advance to compete in the live shows; between seasons nine and thirteen (except season 11), each coach saved one artist (from either the Battle or Knockout rounds) to put through to the Live Playoffs. For seasons 15, 16 and 20, selected singers (prior to the Live elimination rounds) are put through to the \"Comeback Stage\" (which would be mentored by a fifth coach) and competed in a series of duels for a place in the live shows, with the winner earning a right to join a team of their choice. Season 21 added \"Voice Comeback\" where each coach picked one artist to compete in a Twitter poll, and only one artist with the most votes moves on.\nIn the final live performance phase of the competition (playoffs and elimination rounds), artists perform in weekly shows, where public voting narrows to a final group of artists and eventually declares a winner.[6]\nUnder the current format since season three in favor on a more competitive standard previously seen on other similar reality shows, any artists, regardless of each team, who earned the lowest number of votes were progressively eliminated each week until five artists remain (three until season 6, then four prior to season 17), hence introducing a possibility where at least one coach would not represent a single artist in the finale.\nPrior to season three, the coaches have the power to save one artist that had not received the public's vote that week, and as of season two, \"last chance performance\" are added where artists performed an additional song to vie for their coach's save, or other twists employed such as \"instant elimination\", where an artist faced immediate elimination without going through a public vote. However, in deciding who moves on to the final four phase, the television audience and the coaches have equal say. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale, where the outcome is decided solely by public vote. Season 18-20 temporarily reverted this format allowing each coach to guarantee at least one artist advancing in the finale to accommodate the short number of live shows at three weeks,[11] but these changes were reversed on Season 21 by reverting to the regular elimination format while retaining the top five finalists.[12]\nIn a first for a music competition series, NBC and Universal Republic Records offered fans of the show the ability to vote for their favorite artists by purchasing the studio versions of the songs that they perform on the live show each week via the iTunes Store. Alternative methods of voting can be done through toll-free phone calls (until season 8), text messaging, \"The Voice Official App on NBC\" app, and online votes via NBC.com and Facebook. Each method is limited to ten votes per user, and voting lasts until noon EST the next day.\nFrom the top 12 results show of season 3 to the end of season 17, a rule regarding voting was enacted with regard to iTunes singles purchases. In the first two seasons, voting via iTunes purchases of contestant performances counted singly during the official voting window and only accredited to the live show in concern. When a competitor's performance peaked within the Top 10 of the iTunes \"Top 200 Singles Chart\" during this window, it was given an iTunes bonus that multiplies iTunes votes made by ten. In season 5, the iTunes bonus multiplier was reduced to five for the studio versions of the songs performed by the competitors. The finale's vote count included a 'Cumulative iTunes Vote Total' of all singles (from the live shows onwards) purchased during and outside of the various voting windows, with iTunes bonuses previously earned.[13] Between seasons 15 and 17, the bonus multiplier was revised to include streams counting as a vote, and the only artist with the most streams after the voting window ended would receive the bonus.[14] The iTunes bonus multiplier was discontinued beginning with the live shows of season 18, as the performances are now recorded away from the studios and could not be recorded to iTunes or Spotify; this measure was initially enacted for safety reasons as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.[15] In season 19, studio performances are now recorded on YouTube Music, replacing the traditional iTunes and Spotify recordings that were done between the seasons 2\u201317, but this was changed back beginning season 20, though bonuses do not apply regardless if the song charted within the top 10 or not. Season 22 was the first season to not have any studio performances released on any platform overall.\nOnly the studio recording of the contestants' performances, not the live performance, were available on iTunes. In the first season, the battle rounds were recorded in the studio with both artists in the pairing. However, from season 2 to season 18, only the winner's version of the song from the battle round was released. Season 7 reverted to the old style of both artists. With the introduction of the Knockout Rounds in season three, where each contestant sang a separate song, only the winner's single was released.\nThe \"Instant Save\" was introduced in season five. During the live elimination episodes, viewers are given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants at risk of elimination by using their Twitter account (and since season 17, the official app) to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 13.

Previously in 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that The Voice \"is most popular in North Dakota and least popular in New York. It was behind only Duck Dynasty and Fast N' Loud in its correlation with Trump voters\".[57]\nThe first season premiered strong at 11.78 million viewers and actually grew upon that audience through its first season. In the 18\u201349 demographic, the show constantly found itself in the top 5. For its average season rating, the show landed itself as no. 20 with total viewers at nearly 12 million viewers. In the 18\u201349 rankings, the show was no. 4 at a 5.4 ranking.\nThe second season premiered on Super Bowl Sunday, February 5, 2012, and for a while managed to keep a 6.0 in the adults 18\u201349 demographic and 17 million viewers. Partnering The Voice with Smash (NBC's musical drama) helped NBC win the Monday night ratings. However, by Monday, April 9, the ratings had fallen to a 4.0 rating in the adult 18\u201349 demographic.\nThe third season premiered on Monday, September 10, 2012, to 12.28 million viewers and a 4.2 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic and has since then grown to a season-high 4.8 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic on October 8, October 15 and 29, 2012 and a 4.9 rating in the finale. The Voice, along with NBC's new drama, Revolution has once again led NBC to win every Monday night of the season so far, just like it did last season. On Tuesdays, comedies Go On and The New Normal has been successful thanks to The Voice, leading NBC to be the only network of the Big 5 to grow in ratings from last season.\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\nThe Voice: I Want You is a video game based on the television show. It was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Wii U on October 21, 2014, and was published by Activision. The game includes a microphone and has songs from the show including songs performed by the coaches.\nThe Voice is broadcast on the NBC network in the United States. The show premiered in Canada on April 26, 2011, on CTV. In Asia, the series began airing on August 21, 2011, on AXN and was transferred to Star World (now Fox Life) starting in Season 11 until cessation of transmission on October 1, 2021.[117] It premiered in New Zealand on July 16, 2011, on TV2, in Australia on August 9, 2011, on Go!, in South Africa on October 5, 2011, on SABC 3, and on March 31, 2012, in the Philippines on Studio 23 (now S+A).[118] On May 22, 2019, it premiered in Germany on sixx starting Season 14.[119]",

        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol#:~:text=Thompson%2C%20and-,Iam%20Tongi,-.",
        "effective_year": "2023",
        "context": "\nAmerican Idol was based on the British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition Popstars. Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain.[6] Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, including telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows, such as the Eurovision Song Contest), the drama of backstories, and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time.[7]Pop Idol debuted in Britain in 2001 with Lythgoe as showrunner\u200d\u2014\u200cthe executive producer and production leader\u200d\u2014\u200cand Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was successful with the viewing public.[8]\nIn 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the United States, but the idea was initially met with poor responses from all the television networks including Fox.[9] However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was later persuaded to buy the series by his daughter, Elisabeth, who had seen the British show.[9] Although Fox's executives wanted to change the format, Murdoch insisted that it should remain the same as the British one. One change was nevertheless made due to the presence of multiple time zones in the United States that made it impractical for the country to vote in the same time period, an additional half-hour results show was therefore added the day following the performance show.[10] The show was renamed American Idol: The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job of showrunner, but turned down the offer; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to the surprise of Cowell and Fox, it became one of the biggest shows of the summer.[11][12] With its successful launch in the summer, the show was then moved to January and expanded.[13] The show grew into a phenomenon largely due to its personal engagement with the contestants by prompting the viewers to vote, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show on U.S. television, a position it then held for seven consecutive seasons until 2011.[14][15]\nHowever, after a few years of sharp declining ratings starting in 2012, with rating falls of over 20% each season,[16] the fifteenth season would be its last on Fox, ending its run in April 2016.[17] In May 2017, ABC acquired the rights to the series and the program returned for the 2017\u201318 television season.[18][19] The first season of the revived series, or the 16th season overall, started airing in March 2018.[20] Six seasons have been aired on ABC as of May 2023.[21]\nThe show had originally planned on having four judges following the Pop Idol format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell.[9] A fourth judge, radio DJ Stryker, was originally chosen but he dropped out citing \"image concerns.\"[22] In the second season, New York radio personality Angie Martinez had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew only after a few days of auditions due to not being comfortable with giving out criticism.[23] The show decided to continue with the three judges format until the eighth season. All three original judges stayed on the judging panel for eight seasons.\nIn the eighth season, Latin Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge. Abdul left the show in 2009 after the eighth season as a result of failing to agree to terms with the show producers.[24]Emmy Award-winning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul for the ninth season, but left in 2010 after just one season.[25] DioGuardi was let go from American Idol in 2010 after two seasons as producers favored a return to the three-person judge panel previously used prior to DioGuardi's appearance on the show.[26] Cowell also left the show in 2010 to introduce the American version of his show The X Factor for 2011.[27] Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth.\nJennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined the judging panel in the tenth season,[28] but both left in 2012 after two seasons.[29] Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. They were replaced by three new judges, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, and Keith Urban, who joined Jackson in the twelfth season.[30] However, both Carey and Minaj left after one season,[31] and Jackson departed the show after twelve seasons as a judge but would return as a mentor for the thirteenth season in 2014, after which he left the show permanently.[32][33]\nUrban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Lopez returned to American Idol for the thirteenth season and was joined by former mentor Harry Connick Jr.[1] After this, Lopez, Urban, and Connick Jr. remained on the show until its cancellation after the fifteenth season in 2016.[34][35]\nThe first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman following the format of Pop Idol of using two presenters. Dunkleman quit thereafter,[40] resulting in Seacrest becoming the sole host starting with the second season in 2003.\nSeacrest has remained as sole host of American Idol ever since, with the exception of the two-year hiatus between 2016 and 2018 as well as April 8, 2019, when Bobby Bones subbed for Seacrest after the latter fell ill.[41] Dunkleman did, however, return for the initial series finale on Fox in 2016 as a guest.[42]\nThe eligible age-range for contestants is fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in the fourth season, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in the tenth season. The contestants have to be legal U.S. residents, can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons, and must not have held a current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage[43] (in previous years by the audition stage).[44]\nFor the first eighteen seasons, contestants went through at least three sets of cuts. The first was a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these made it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sing in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television.[45] Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10 and 60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood (the average total is between 150 and 200)[citation needed].\nFrom the nineteenth season onwards, contestants request a Zoom interview and audition remotely for the show's producers. If the audition goes well, they will then invite the contestants to audition in front of the judges, in one of the audition cities.[46]\nOnce in Hollywood, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until the tenth season, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood.[47] In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and performed a song together.[48] In the final round, the contestants performed solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band\u200d\u2014\u200cdepending on the season. In the second and third seasons, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In the seventh season, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round.[49] In the twelfth season, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.\nIn the tenth and eleventh seasons, a further round was added in Las Vegas, where the contestants performed in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists.[50][51] At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants were selected to move on to the semi-final stage. In the twelfth season the Las Vegas round became a Sudden Death round, where the judges had to choose five guys and five girls each night (four nights) to make the top twenty.[52] In the thirteenth season, the Las Vegas round was eliminated and a new round called \"Hollywood or Home\" was added, where if the judges were uncertain about some contestants, those contestants were required to perform soon after landing in Los Angeles, and those who failed to impress were sent back home before they reached Hollywood.[53] In the fourteenth season, the \"Hollywood or Home\" round was dropped, and a Showcase round was added, where the contestants performed at the House of Blues or auditorium for the judges and a live audience, and these performances determine who makes into the Top 24.[54] In the seventeenth and eighteenth seasons, the showcase round took place in Hawaii. In the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first seasons, a showstopper round was used.\nFrom the semi-finals onward, the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a toll-free telephone number for each contestant was displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message was registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers were allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window. However, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers.[55] One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges. Over 110 million votes were cast in the first season, and by the tenth season the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million. Voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when AT&T Wireless joined as a sponsor of the show, and 7.5 million text messages were sent to American Idol that season.[56] The number of text messages rapidly increased, reaching 178 million texts by the eighth season.[57] Online voting was offered for the first time in the tenth season. The votes are counted and verified by Telescope Inc.[58]\nIn the first three seasons, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In the first season, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In the second and third seasons, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. These seasons also featured a wildcard round, where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In the first season, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In the second and third seasons, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all.\nFrom the fourth through seventh and ninth seasons, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.\nThe wildcard round returned in the eighth season, wherein there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward \u2013 the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer \u2013 for each night, and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. Starting in tenth season, the girls and boys perform on separate nights. In the tenth and eleventh seasons, five of each gender were chosen, and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13. In the twelfth season, the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups, with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10. In the thirteenth season, there were thirty semifinalists, but only twenty semifinalists (ten for each gender) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows, with five in each gender based on the vote and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13. In the fourteenth season, the top 24 performed at The Fillmore Detroit, starting with the 12 males on one night and then the 12 females on the next night. The following week, the same order went for the top 16, with four males eliminated, followed by four females based on the vote. Then, on the first night of finals, a similar sequence from the thirteenth season was used to determine the final 12, with five of each gender based on the vote and two wildcards chosen by the judges. In the fifteenth season, the top 24 performed at Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in Los Angeles and were split into two groups of twelve and performed twice, one being a solo performance and one being a duet with a former Idol contestant. In each group, the judges chose 7 contestants to advance to the top 14 where the judges chose 4 to advance to the top 10 and remaining 6 contestants were chosen based on the vote. In the sixteenth season, the top 24 performed at the Academy in the Heart of LA, and the show repeated the process from the previous season. However, instead of Idol alumnus as duet partners, superstar celebrity singers were used as the duet partners. In the seventeenth season, the same process was repeated again. However, instead of a top 24, it's a top 20, the contestants performed at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, and performed solos in one episode, and performed the duets in two episodes. In the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the top 20 performed at their homes, and based on the vote, half of the top 20 would advance to the top 10, and the other half would be eliminated. However, a wild card was given to one of the bottom 10 to save them from elimination.[59][60] In the nineteenth season, the show used a combination of the process from the sixteenth and fourteenth seasons. In the twentieth season, the show repeated the process from the previous season, but they used a top 20 instead of a top 16, and there were no all star duets. In the twenty-first season, the same process was repeated, but they started with a top 26 instead of a top 24.\nThe finals are broadcast in primetime from Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience (except the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). From 2002 to 2022, the venue was CBS Television City. Starting in 2023, it changed to Red Studios. The finals lasted eight weeks in the first season. From the second to ninth and fourteenth seasons, the finals lasted eleven weeks. The tenth and eleventh seasons lasted for twelve weeks, while the twelfth season lasted for ten weeks. In the thirteenth season, the finals lasted thirteen weeks. The finals lasted seven weeks in the fifteenth season, and six weeks in the sixteenth season. Each finalist performs songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as Motown, disco, or big band, songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley or The Beatles, or more general themes such as Billboard number-one hits or songs from the contestant's year of birth. Contestants usually worked with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. From the tenth to twelfth seasons, Jimmy Iovine was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sang one song each week, but this was increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.\nThe most popular contestants are usually not revealed in the results show. Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes was called to the center of the stage. One of these three was usually sent to safety; however the two remaining were not necessarily the bottom two.[61] The contestant with the fewest votes was then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant's time on the show was played and they gave their final performance (from the fourteenth season onward, the montage and the final performance were dropped). However, in the sixth season, during the series' first ever Idol Gives Back episode, no contestant was eliminated, but on the following week, two were sent home. Moreover, from the eighth season onwards, the judges may overturn viewers' decision with a \"Judges' Save\" if they unanimously agreed to. \"The save\" could only be used once, and only up through the Top 5. In the eighth to tenth and fourteenth seasons, a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save, but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons, a regular single elimination took place. The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently, a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week.\nThe \"Fan Save\" was introduced in the fourteenth season. During the finals, viewers were given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 8.\nDuring the original run of American Idol on Fox, the finale week consisted of a one-hour long final performance night and a two-hour last episode of the season that culminates in revealing the winner, both of which are broadcast live in the U.S. Eastern and Central time zones. For the first, third through sixth and fourteenth through fifteenth seasons it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The second-season finale took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre, which had an audience capacity of over 6,000. In the seventh through thirteenth seasons, the venue was at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live, which holds an audience of over 7,000. Since the show's reboot on ABC, the venue remains the same throughout the entire show (excluding auditions), but has been stretched to a single three-hour season finale that is annually aired live simultaneously in all U.S. territories. The eighteenth-season finale was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe winner usually receives a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums,[62][63] and secures a management contract with American Idol-affiliated 19 Management (which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts. All winners prior to the ninth season reportedly earned at least $1 million in their first year as winner.[63] At first the contract came with a $250,000-plus advance, but dropped to about $62,500 over the Fox years.[64] All the runners-up of the first ten seasons, as well as some of other finalists, had also received record deals with major labels. However, starting in the eleventh season, the runner-up may only be guaranteed a single-only deal.[65]BMG/Sony (first through ninth seasons), UMG (tenth through fifteenth seasons), and Disney Music Group's Hollywood Records (sixteenth through eighteenth seasons) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season's finale. In the fourteenth and fifteenth seasons, the winner was signed with Big Machine Records. Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants' albums, such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. All top 10 (11 in the tenth and twelfth seasons, 5 in the fourteenth season, and 7 in the sixteenth season) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour, where the participants may each earn a six-figure sum.[66]\n^Owing to the production difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the finale had five contestants instead of three, and the three contestants who failed to place in the top 2 finished in joint-third place.\nEach season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round from the tenth through twelfth seasons), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinals onward the contestants perform their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed during a results segment. The results segment feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results also features homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner of the season is revealed.\nWith the exception of the first two seasons, the contestants in the semifinals onward perform in front of a studio audience. They perform with a full band in the finals. The current musical director is Kris Pooley, who has been with the show since the sixteenth season. In previous seasons, the American Idol band was led by Rickey Minor (fourth through ninth and thirteenth through fifteenth seasons) and Ray Chew (tenth through twelfth seasons). Assistance has also been given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and Debra Byrd to contestants behind the scene. Starting with the seventh season, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onward. In later seasons, the contestants were allowed to perform with a musical instrument in the auditions. During the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays from the tenth through thirteenth seasons, with the tenth, eleventh and thirteenth season finales aired on Tuesday and Wednesday. From the fourteenth season onward, there were no separate results shows. On the fourteenth season, the show aired on Wednesday nights, and on the fifteenth season, Thursday nights. From the sixteenth season onward, it aired on Sundays and Mondays.[citation needed]\nThe first season of American Idol debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell served as judges.\nIn the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital.[67]Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed on his blog, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.[68]\nIn what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, \"A Moment Like This\", went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, From Justin to Kelly, which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become one of the most successful Idol contestants internationally,[70] with worldwide album sales of more than 25 million.[71]\nFollowing the success of the first season, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show's budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Ryan Seacrest as the lone host. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Kristin Adams was a correspondent for this season.[72]\nCorey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation.[73] Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year \u2013 Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and Frenchie Davis for having previously modeled for an adult website.[74]\nThe season finale drew more than 38 million viewers, marking Idol's biggest audience ever for a single episode. Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner, beating Clay Aiken by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through.[75] In an interview prior to the fifth season, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.[76]\nBoth finalists found success after the show, but Aiken out-performed Studdard's coronation song \"Flying Without Wings\" with his single release from the show \"This Is the Night\", as well as in their subsequent album releases. The fourth-place finisher Josh Gracin also enjoyed some success as a country singer.[77]\nThe third season premiered on January 19, 2004. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\" received widespread attention. His exposure on Idol landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third bestselling singer from that season.[78]\nMuch media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated.[79] Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes \"incredibly racist\".[80] The prolonged stays of John Stevens and Jasmine Trias in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke 'blown out of proportion'.[81]\nThe performance of \"Summertime\" by Barrino, later known simply as \"Fantasia\", at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite Idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show.[82] Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single \"I Believe\", a song co-written by the first season finalist Tamyra Gray, and DeGarmo released \"Dreams\".\nThe fourth season premiered on January 18, 2005. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This was the first full season of the series to be aired in high definition; the finale of the third season was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season,[44] and among those who benefited from this new rule were Constantine Maroulis and Bo Bice, the two rockers of the show.\nThe top 12 finalists originally included Mario Vazquez, but he dropped out citing 'personal reasons'[83] and was replaced by Nikko Smith. Later, an employee of Fremantle Media, which produces the show, sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by Vazquez toward him during the show.[84]\nDuring the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.\nIn May 2005, Carrie Underwood was announced the winner, with Bice the runner-up. Both Underwood and Bice released the coronation song \"Inside Your Heaven\", with Underwood's version of the song making her the first country artist ever to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[85] As of 2015, Underwood has become the most successful Idol contestant in the U.S.,[70] selling 16 million albums in the country,[86] while selling a total of 65 million records worldwide.[87]\nThe fifth season began on January 17, 2006. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. It remains the highest-rated season in the show's run so far. Two of the more prominent contestants during the Hollywood round were the Brittenum twins who were later disqualified for identity theft.[88]\nChris Daughtry's performance of Fuel's \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\" on the show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new lead singer, an invitation he declined.[89] His performance of Live's version of \"I Walk the Line\" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters for not crediting the arrangement to Live.[90] He was eliminated at the top four in a shocking result.\nThe sixth season began on Tuesday, January 16, 2007. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The premiere drew a massive audience of 37.3 million viewers, peaking in the last half hour with more than 41 million viewers.[92]\nTeenager Sanjaya Malakar was the season's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo,[93] and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog Vote for the Worst and satellite radio personality Howard Stern, who both encouraged fans to vote for him. However, on the Top 7 results, Sanjaya was voted off.[94]\nThis season saw the first Idol Gives Back telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76 million in corporate and viewer donations.[95] No contestant was eliminated that week, but two (Phil Stacey and Chris Richardson) were eliminated the next.\nThis season also saw the launch of the American Idol Songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the \"coronation song\". Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, \"This Is My Now\", was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by Sparks on May 24, 2007.[96]\nThe seventh season premiered on January 15, 2008, for a two-day, four-hour premiere. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The media focused on the professional status of the seventh season contestants, the so-called 'ringers',[97] many of whom, including Kristy Lee Cook, Brooke White, Michael Johns, and in particular Carly Smithson, had prior recording contracts.[98] Contestant David Hernandez also attracted some attention due to his past employment as a stripper.[99]\nFor the finals, American Idol debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. David Cook's performance of \"Billie Jean\" on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the Chris Cornell arrangement to be David Cook's own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell's version. Cornell himself said he was 'flattered' and praised David Cook's performance.[100] David Cook was taken to the hospital after the top-nine performance show due to heart palpitations and high blood pressure.[101]\nDavid Archuleta's performance of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in the tenth season, called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget.[102]Jason Castro's semi-final performance of \"Hallelujah\" also received considerable attention, and it propelled Jeff Buckley's version of the song to the top of the Billboarddigital song chart.[103] This was the first season in which contestants' recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts.[104]\nIdol Gives Back returned on April 9, 2008, and raised $64 million for charity.[95]\nThe finalists were Cook and Archuleta. David Cook was announced the winner on May 21, 2008, the first rocker to win the show. Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S.[91]\nThe American Idol Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the \"coronation song\". The winning song, \"The Time of My Life\", was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008.\nThe eighth season premiered on January 13, 2009. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This season featured the first major change to the judging panel; a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced. Mike Darnell, the president of alternative programming for Fox, stated that the season would focus more on the contestants' personal life.[105]\nThis was also the first season without executive producer Nigel Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show So You Think You Can Dance.[106] The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. Idol Gives Back was canceled for this season due to the global recession at the time.\nThere were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the \"Judges' Save\", and Matt Giraud was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated.\nThe two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since the second season. It was claimed,[107] and then later retracted,[108] that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from Allen's home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.[109]\nBoth Allen and Lambert released the coronation song, \"No Boundaries\" which was co-written by DioGuardi. This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status.[110]\nThe ninth season premiered on January 12, 2010. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Kara DioGuardi, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Paula Abdul left the show and Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week. One of the most prominent auditioners this season was General Larry Platt whose performance of \"Pants on the Ground\" became a viral hit song.[111]\nCrystal Bowersox, who has Type-I diabetes, fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized.[112] The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer, wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.[112]\nMichael Lynche was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges' Save. The next week Katie Stevens and Andrew Garcia were eliminated. That week, Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first Idol alum to do so. Idol Gives Back returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised $45 million.[95]\nA special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show's past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.\nThe final two contestants were Lee DeWyze and Bowersox. DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song \u2013 DeWyze chose U2's \"Beautiful Day\", and Bowersox chose Patty Griffin's \"Up to the Mountain\". This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.[113]\nThe tenth season premiered on January 19, 2011. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the American version of The X Factor), Kara DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres, who left the show on her own accord.[114][28]\nRandy Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth. Nigel Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the new partner of American Idol, acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors,[28] although in later episodes special guest mentors such as Beyonc\u00e9, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in.\nThe tenth season is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40-second video audition via Myspace.[115]Karen Rodriguez was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds.\nOne of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina, whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fianc\u00e9e received widespread coverage.[116] Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. Casey Abrams, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. In the following week, Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated.\nPia Toscano, one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticisms from some former Idol contestants, as well as actor Tom Hanks.[117] After Idol, Jennifer Lopez helped guide her career.[118]\nThe two finalists in 2011 were Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery, both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win American Idol. McCreery released his first single, \"I Love You This Big\", as his coronation song, and Alaina released \"Like My Mother Does\". McCreery's debut album, Clear as Day, became the first debut album by an Idol winner to reach No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 since Ruben Studdard's Soulful in 2003, and he became the youngest male artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200.[119]\nThe eleventh season premiered on January 18, 2012. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, and Randy Jackson returned as judges. One more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25, which was later revealed to be Jermaine Jones. However, on March 14, Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants. Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests.[120]\nFinalist Phillip Phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to the hospital before the Top 13 results show, and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones.[121] He was reported to have eight surgeries during his Idol run, and had considered quitting the show due to the pain.[122] He underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished.[123]\nJessica Sanchez received the fewest votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their \"save\" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, Colton Dixon was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.\nPhillips became the winner, beating Sanchez. During the finale, fifth season finalist Ace Young proposed marriage to third season runner-up Diana DeGarmo on stage \u2013 which she accepted.[124]\nPhillips released \"Home\" as his coronation song, while Sanchez released \"Change Nothing\". Phillips' \"Home\" has since become the best selling of all coronation songs, with over 5 million copies sold.[125][126]\nThe twelfth season premiered on January 16, 2013. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. Randy Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. This season's judging panel consisted of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj.\nThis was the first season since the ninth season to have four judges on the panel. The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to TMZ.[127]\nThe top 10 contestants started with five males and five females, however, the males were eliminated consecutively in the first five weeks, with Lazaro Arbos the last male to be eliminated. For the first time in the show's history, the top 5 contestants were all female. It was also the first time that the judges' \"save\" was not used, the top four contestants were therefore given an extra week to perform again with their votes carried over with no elimination in the first week.\n23-year-old Candice Glover won the season with Kree Harrison taking the runner-up spot. Glover is the first female to win American Idol since Jordin Sparks. Glover released \"I Am Beautiful\" as a single while Harrison released \"All Cried Out\" immediately after the show. Glover sold poorly with her debut album, and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label.[128]\nTowards the end of the season, Randy Jackson, the last remaining of the original judges, announced he would no longer serve as a judge to pursue other business ventures.[32] Both judges Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj also decided to leave after one season to focus on their music careers.[31]\nThe thirteenth season premiered on January 15, 2014. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Keith Urban returned as a judge. Urban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Randy Jackson returned, though Jackson moved from the judging panel to the role of in-mentor. Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj left the panel after one season. Former judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick, Jr. joined Urban on the panel. Connick Jr. served as a mentor for Idol in 2010 and 2012.[129] Also, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick were replaced as executive producers by Per Blankens, Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Pragger. Bill DeRonde replaced Warwick as a director of the audition episodes, while Louis J. Horvitz replaced Gregg Gelfand as a director of the show.[130]\nThis was the first season where the contestants were permitted to perform in the final rounds songs they wrote themselves. In the Top 8, Sam Woolf received the fewest votes, but he was saved from elimination by the judges. The 500th episode of the series was the Top 3 performance night.[131]\nThe fourteenth season premiered on January 7, 2015. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick, Jr. returned for their respective fourth, third and second seasons as judges. Eighth season runner-up Adam Lambert filled in for Urban during the New York City auditions. Randy Jackson did not return as the in-house mentor and left the show permanently.[134]Scott Borchetta replaced Jackson as the mentor.\nChanges this season include only airing one episode a week during the final ten.[135] Coca-Cola ended their longtime sponsorship of the show[136] and Ford Motor Company maintained a reduced role. The winner of the season also received a recording contract with Big Machine Records.\nNick Fradiani won the season, defeating Clark Beckham. Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region. Fradiani released \"Beautiful Life\" as his coronation single while Beckham released \"Champion\". Jax, the third place finalist, also released a single called \"Forcefield\".\nFox announced on May 11, 2015, that the fifteenth season would be the final season of American Idol; as such, the season was expected to have an additional focus on the program's alumni. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, with Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez all returning as judges.[17] The fifteenth season premiered on January 6, 2016. The season was shortened by four weeks compared to previous years.[137] During the finale episode, President Barack Obama praised the millions of young people that voted for contestants and pitched that they vote in the upcoming election. The farewell season concluded on April 7, 2016. Seacrest signed off by saying: \"And one more time\u2014this is so tough\u2014we say to you from Hollywood, goodnight America\", and then he added, \"for now.\"[138]\nIn early 2017, Variety reported that Fremantle Media was in talks to revive the show for NBC or for its original network, Fox.[142] A dispute between Fremantle and Core Media Group derailed these plans.[143] In May 2017, ABC was making a bid to revive the program.[144] ABC acquired the rights to the series, and American Idol returned for the 2017\u201318 television season.[145][146]\nIn July 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would return as host,[147] and by September 2017 it was revealed that Katy Perry,[36]Luke Bryan[37] and Lionel Richie would serve as judges.[38][148] The sixteenth season premiered on March 11, 2018.[20] This was the first season of American Idol to air on ABC. The season was again shortened compared to the previous season to twelve weeks, with multiple elimination in the final rounds. Unlike previous seasons where only two finalists remained in the final episode, three finalists performed in the finale. On May 21, 2018, the season concluded with Maddie Poppe crowned the winner, beating Caleb Lee Hutchinson as runner-up and Gabby Barrett in third place. Her winning song was \"Going, Going, Gone\". Caleb Lee Hutchinson released \"Johnny Cash Heart\" as a single, while Gabby Barrett's song was \"Rivers Deep\".[149]\nABC renewed the revival series for another season. Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[150] The seventeenth season premiered on March 3, 2019. For the finale, the show no longer features separate performance and result shows. On May 19, 2019, the season concluded with three finalists, with Madison VanDenburg eliminated in third place after performing two songs, and the final two performing their last song. For the first time, there were no separate performance and grand finale shows this season. Laine Hardy was crowned the winner and Alejandro Aranda runner-up. Hardy released a single, \"Flame\", immediately after the win, but Aranda did not.[151][152] However, Aranda later released a song he performed in the finale, \"Tonight\", under the name Scarypoolparty on June 28, 2019.[153]\nOn May 13, 2019, the series was renewed for an eighteenth season and it premiered on February 16, 2020.[154][155] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[156] For the first time, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, from the top 20 to the finale, the contestants performed in their own homes, while Ryan Seacrest hosted the show remotely in his own home in Los Angeles with the judges also in their respective homes.[60][157] The season was also further truncated, with the top 5 performing in the finale. Each finalist also performed only two songs for the finale.[158] On May 17, the season concluded, with Just Sam crowned as the winner, with Arthur Gunn finishing as the runner-up.[159] \"Rise Up\", the song Just Sam performed for their audition and reprised on the finale, was released as their debut song.[160][161]\nOn May 15, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a nineteenth season and it premiered on February 14, 2021.[162][163] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[164] Later in October, it was announced that Bobby Bones will return as mentor. On May 23, the season concluded, with Chayce Beckham crowned the winner, with Willie Spence finishing as the runner-up. \"23\", the song Chayce Beckham wrote and performed for Top 4, was released as his debut song.[21]\nOn May 13, 2021, ABC renewed the series for a twentieth season and it premiered on February 27, 2022.[165][166] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[167] On December 31, it was announced that Bones would not be returning as a mentor.[168] On May 22, the season concluded, with Noah Thompson crowned as the winner, with HunterGirl finishing as the runner-up. \"One Day Tonight\", the song Noah Thompson performed for the Grand Finale, was released as his debut song.\nOn May 13, 2022, ABC renewed the series for a twenty-first season and it premiered on February 19, 2023.[169][170] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges. On May 21, the season concluded, with Iam Tongi crowned as the winner, with Megan Danielle finishing as the runner-up.\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of American Idol. It holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in the Nielsen annual television ratings; it became the highest-rated of all television programs in the United States overall for an unprecedented seven consecutive years,[173] or eight consecutive (and total) years when either its performance or result show was ranked number one overall.[5]\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\nAmerican Idol premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002. The first show drew 9.9 million viewers, giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30 pm spot in over a year.[239] The audience steadily grew, and by finale night, the audience had averaged 23 million, with more than 40 million watching some part of that show.[240] That episode was placed third amongst all age groups, but more importantly it led in the 18\u201349 demographic, the age group most valued by advertisers.[12]\nThe growth continued into the next season, starting with a season premiere of 26.5 million.[174] The season attracted an average of 21.7 million viewers, and was placed second overall amongst the 18\u201349 age group.[241] The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest-rated ever American Idol episode at 38.1 million for the final hour.[242] By the third season, the show had become the top show in the 18\u201349 demographic[242] a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including the tenth season, and its competition stages ranked first in the nationwide overall ratings. By the fourth season, American Idol had become the most-watched series amongst all viewers on American TV for the first time, with an average viewership of 26.8 million.[243] The show reached its peak in the fifth season with numbers averaging 30.6 million per episode, and this season remains the highest-rated of the series.[243]\nThe sixth season premiered with the series' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most-watched episodes of American Idol. During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before,[3] as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC's The Cosby Show. The show was dubbed \"the Death Star\",[92] and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses.[3] However, the sixth season also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year. The sixth season was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second-highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.[242]\nThe loss of viewers continued into the seventh season. The premiere was down 11% among total viewers,[174] and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest-rated Wednesday show among the 18\u201334 demo since the first season in 2002.[244] However, the ratings rebounded for the seventh-season finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids, and improved over the sixth season as the series' third most watched finale. The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most watched TV network in the country for the first time since its inception, a first ever in American television history for a non-Big Three major broadcast network.[245] Overall ratings for the season were down 10% from the sixth season,[246] which is in line with the fall in viewership across all networks due in part to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike.[247]\nThe declining trend however continued into the eighth season, as total viewers numbers fell by 5\u201310% for early episodes compared to the seventh season,[248] and by 9% for the finale.[175] In the ninth season, Idol's six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken, when NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 17 beat Idol in the same time slot with 30.1 million viewers over Idol's 18.4 million.[249] Nevertheless, American Idol overall finished its ninth season as the most watched TV series for the sixth year running, breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by CBS' All in the Family and NBC's The Cosby Show.[250]\nIn the tenth season, the total viewer numbers for the first week of shows fell 12\u201313%, and by up to 23% in the 18\u201349 demo compared to the ninth season.[196] Later episodes, however, retained viewers better, and the season ended on a high with a significant increase in viewership for the finale \u2013 up 12% for the adults 18\u201349 demographic and a 21% increase in total viewers from the ninth-season finale.[251] While the overall viewer number has increased this season, its viewer demographics have continued to age year on year \u2013 the median age this season was 47.2 compared to a median age of 32.1 in its first season.[252] The demographics also became \"whiter\" over time and less diverse.[253] Nevertheless, in the 2010\u201311 television season, Fox maintained its lead on over other networks with its seventh consecutive season of victory overall in the 18\u201349 demographic ratings in the United States.\nThe eleventh season, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as The Voice and The X Factor.[254] The ratings for the first two episodes of the eleventh season fell 16\u201321% in overall viewer numbers and 24\u201327% in the 18/49 demo,[200] while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18\u201349 demo.[201] The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. For the first time in eight years, American Idol lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to NBC Sunday Night Football, although the strengths of Idol in its second year in the Wednesday-Thursday primetime slots helped Fox achieve the longest period of 18\u201349 demographic victory in the Nielsen ratings, standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012.[202]\nThe loss of viewers continued into the twelfth season, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18\u201349 demo.[255] The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18\u201349 demo.[256] The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season.[257] The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18\u201349 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and American Idol lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013\u201314 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, and never regained its Top 10 position by the series' end in 2016.[34]\nThe continuing decline influenced further changes for the fourteenth season, including the loss of Coca-Cola as the show's major sponsor, and a decision to only broadcast one, two-hour show per week during the top 12 rounds (with results from the previous week integrated into the performance show, rather than having a separate results show).[258][35][259] On May 11, 2015, prior to the fourteenth-season finale, Fox announced that the fifteenth season of American Idol would be its last.[17] Despite these changes, the show's ratings would decline more sharply. The fourteenth-season finale was the lowest-rated finale ever, with an average of only 8.03 million viewers watching the finale. The show's ratings, however, rebounded in its final season and ended its run in 2016 as Fox's first-ever program to conclude its run without dropping from the Nielsen Top 30 most-watched television shows in each of its seasons.\nFor the revived series on ABC, the ratings were lower but remained stable compared to previous seasons on Fox. The finale of the seventeenth season was slightly more watched than the sixteenth.[260]\nEarly reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\".[261] Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\".[12] It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\",[262] and \"a romp in humiliation\".[263] Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted,[264] and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\".[265] The decision to send the first season winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"[266]\nSome of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of Entertainment Weekly, thought that \"for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, Idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business.\"[267] Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show \"undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism\".[268] Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has \"reshaped the American songbook\", \"led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture\", and connects \"the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future.\"[269] Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that \"Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him.\"[270] Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self-respect.[271]\nSome in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show. Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the \"true art form of music\", thought that shows like American Idol made it seem \"so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight\", and that \"television is a lie\".[272] Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol \"isn't really about music. It's about all the bad aspects of the music business \u2013 the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.' \"[273] That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that \"Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award\".[274] It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol, commenting on talent shows in general, said that \"there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs\".[275]American Idol revolutionized American pop culture and the pop idol process and has provided an opportunity for many to bypass the small club scene and allow a much larger audience to participate in and select the next potential chart topping performer.[276]\nThe success of the show's alumni, however, has led to a more positive assessment of the show, and the show was described as having \"proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records\".[277] While the industry is divided on the show success, its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format.[278] According to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, \"if you want to try and get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV, Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone\", and that country music and Idol \"go together well\".[279]\nThroughout the series, twelve of the seventeen Idol winners, including its first five, had come from the Southern United States.[284] A large number of other finalists during the series' run have also hailed from the American South, including Clay Aiken, Kellie Pickler, and Chris Daughtry,[284] who are all from North Carolina. In 2012, an analysis of the 131 contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that 48% have some connection to the Southern United States.[285]\nThe show itself was popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch American Idol during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as Kentucky, were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series.[284] Data from Nielsen SoundScan, a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47 million CDs sold by Idol contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.[284]\nTheories given for the success of Southerners on Idol have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the Bible Belt, where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing.[284][286][287] Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride.[288] According to fifth season winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of Alabama, \"People in the South have a lot of pride ... So, they're adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region.\"[284]\nFor five consecutive seasons, starting in the seventh season, the title was given to a white male who plays the guitar \u2013 a trend that Idol pundits call the \"White guy with guitar\" or \"WGWG\" factor.[289] Just hours before the eleventh-season finale, where Phillip Phillips was named the winner, Richard Rushfield, author of the book American Idol: The Untold Story, said, \"You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it, not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star competing on the contemporary radio, but as .... who's the nicest guy in a popularity contest\", he says, \"And that has led to this dynasty of four, and possibly now five, consecutive, affable, very nice, good-looking white boys.\"[289]\nSome fans call the final performance of the night the \"pimp spot\" because it usually receives a big boost in votes, due to the recency effect. By performing first, a performer may benefit from the primacy effect, but any other early performance may be stifled. The second performance spot is sometimes called the \"un-pimp spot\" because it is the least beneficial.[290]\nThe show was criticized in earlier seasons over the onerous contract contestants had to sign that gave excessive control to 19 Entertainment over their future careers[291] and handed a large part of their future earnings to the management.[292][293]\nIndividual contestants have generated controversy in this competition for their past actions[74][294] or for being 'ringers' planted by the producers.[97] A number of contestants have been disqualified for various reasons, such as for having an existing contract or undisclosed criminal record, although the show has also been accused of a double standard for disqualifying some but not others.[295]\nVoting results have been a consistent source of controversy. The mechanism of voting has aroused considerable criticism, most notably in the second season when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote,[75] and in the eighth season, when the massive increase in text votes[57] fueled the texting controversy.[109] Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the first season.[296] Since 2004, votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol and Vote for the Worst.[citation needed]\nThe enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated were transformative for the Fox Broadcasting Company. American Idol and other shows such as Survivor and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire were credited for expanding reality television programming in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, and Idol became the most watched non-scripted primetime television series, which it remained for almost a decade, from 2003 to 2012, breaking records on U.S. television (dominated by drama shows and sitcoms in the preceding decades).[297]\nThe show pushed Fox to become the number one U.S. TV network among adults aged 18\u201349,[298] the key demographic coveted by advertisers, for an unprecedented eight consecutive years by 2012.[299] Its success also helped lift the ratings of other shows that were scheduled around it such as House and Bones, and Idol, for years, was Fox's strongest platform primetime television program for promoting eventual hit shows of the 2010s (of the same network) such as Glee, New Girl and Empire.[3] The show, its creator Simon Fuller claimed, \"saved Fox\".[300]\nAs one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, American Idol has had a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment.[305][306] It helped create a number of highly successful recording artists, such as Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Carrie Underwood, as well as others of varying notability. The alumni of the show have received between them 54 Grammy nominations and 13 Grammy awards by 2016, with Carrie Underwood winning seven.[307][308]\nVarious American Idol alumni had success on various record charts around the world; in the U.S. they had achieved 345 number ones on the Billboardcharts in its first 10 years,[4] and 458 by its last year of broadcast in 2016, with 100 achieved by Kelly Clarkson alone.[309] According to Fred Bronson, author of books on the Billboard charts, no other entity has ever created as many hit-making artists and bestselling albums and singles.[310] In 2007, American Idol alums accounted for 2.1% of all music sales.[311] Its alumni have a massive impact on radio; in 2007, American Idol had become \"a dominant force in radio\" according to Rich Meyer, president of the radio station monitoring research company Mediabase.[312] By 2010, four winners each had more than a million radio spins, with Kelly Clarkson leading the field with over four million spins.[313]\nAt the end of the show's run on Fox in 2016, Idol's contestants have sold more than 60 million albums in the US, resulting in more than 80 Platinum records and 95 Gold records. Its participants have generated more than 450 Billboard No. 1 hits and sold more than 260 million digital downloads.[314]\nThe impact of American Idol was also strongly felt in musical theater, where many of Idol alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former American Idol contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on.[315][316] The casting of a popular Idol contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd,[317] won a role in Dreamgirls and eventually went on to win an Academy Award for her performance. She later became the show's first and only alumnus ever to win the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony).\nThe dominance of American Idol in the ratings had made it the most profitable show in U.S. TV for many years. The show was estimated to generate $900 million for the year 2004 through sales of TV ads, albums, merchandise and concert tickets.[300] By the seventh season, the show was estimated to earn around $900 million from its ad revenue alone, not including ancillary sponsorship deals and other income.[320][321] One estimate puts the total TV revenue for the first eight seasons of American at $6.4 billion.[322] Sponsors that bought fully integrated packages can expect a variety of promotions of their products on the show, such as product placement, adverts and product promotion integrated into the show, and various promotional opportunities.[323] Other off-air promotional partners pay for the rights to feature \"Idol\" branding on their packaging, products and marketing programs.[324]American Idol also partnered with Disney in its theme park attraction The American Idol Experience.\nAmerican Idol became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting the fourth season,[325] and by the next season, it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series, selling over $700,000 for a 30-seconds slot,[326] and reaching up to $1.3 million for the finale.[327] Its ad prices reached a peak in the seventh season at $737,000.[321] Estimated revenue more than doubled from $404 million in the third season to $870 million in the sixth season.[328] While that declined from the eighth season onwards, it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor,[329][330] with advertising revenue topping $800 million annually the next few seasons.[331] However, the sharp drop in ratings in the eleventh season also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for the twelfth season, and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers.[332] By 2014, ad revenue from had fallen to $427 million where a 30-second spot went for less than $300,000.[333] For the relaunched Idol on ABC, it has been reported that a 30-second spot may cost between $120,000\u2013$160,000.[334]\nFord Motor Company and Coca-Cola were two of the first sponsors of American Idol in its first season. The sponsorship deal cost around $10 million in the first season,[335] rising to $35 million by the seventh season,[324] and between $50 to $60 million in the tenth season.[336] The third major sponsor AT&T Wireless joined in the second season but ended after the twelfth season, and Coca-Cola officially ended its sponsorship after the thirteenth season amidst the declining ratings of Idol in the mid-2010s. iTunes sponsored the show since the seventh season.\nAmerican Idol prominent display of its sponsors' logo and products had been noted since the early seasons.[12][240] By the sixth season, Idol showed 4,349 product placements according to Nielsen Media Research.[337] The branded entertainment integration proved beneficial to its advertisers \u2013 promotion of AT&T text-messaging as a means to vote successfully introduced the technology into the wider culture,[56][338] and Coca-Cola has seen its equity increased during the show.[339]\nCoca-Cola \u2013 Cups bearing logo of Coca-Cola, and occasionally its subsidiary Vitaminwater,[340] are featured prominently on the judges table. Contestants are shown between songs held in the \"Coca-Cola Red Room\", the show's equivalent of the green room. (The Coca-Cola logo however is obscured during rebroadcast in the UK which until 2011 banned product placement.[341])\nFord \u2013 Contestants appear in the special Ford videos on the results shows, and winners Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Hicks, and Kris Allen have also appeared in commercials for Ford.[323] The final two each won a free Ford Mustang in the fourth through sixth seasons, Ford Escape Hybrid in the seventh season, Ford Fusion Hybrid in the eighth season, Ford Fiesta in the ninth season, and 2013 Ford Fusion in the eleventh season. In the tenth season Scotty McCreery chose a Ford F-150 and Lauren Alaina chose Shelby Mustang. In the red room, there is a glass table with a Ford wheel as its base.\nAT&T \u2013 AT&T Mobility is promoted as the service provider for text-voting. AT&T created an ad campaign that centered on an air-headed teenager going around telling people to vote.\nPrevious sponsors include Old Navy and Clairol's Herbal Essences. In the second and third seasons, contestants sometimes donned Old Navy clothing for their performances with celebrity stylist Steven Cojocaru assisting with their wardrobe selection,[342] and contestants received Clairol-guided hair makeovers. In the seventh-season finale, both David Cook and David Archuleta appeared in \"Risky Business\"-inspired commercials for Guitar Hero, a sponsor of the tour that year.\nCoca-Cola's archrival PepsiCo declined to sponsor American Idol at the show's start. What the Los Angeles Times later called \"missing one of the biggest marketing opportunities in a generation\" contributed to Pepsi losing market share, by 2010 falling to third place from second in the United States. PepsiCo sponsored the American version of Cowell's The X Factor in hopes of not repeating its Idol mistake until its cancellation.[343]\nThe top ten (eleven in the tenth season, five in the fourteenth season, and seven in the sixteenth season) toured at the end of every season except for the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons.[345][346] In the twelfth season tour a semi-finalist who won a sing-off was also added to the tour. Kellogg's Pop-Tarts was the sponsor for the first seven seasons, and Guitar Hero was added for the seventh season tour. M&M's Pretzel Chocolate Candies was a sponsor of the ninth season tour. The fifth season tour was the most successful tour with gross of over $35 million.[347] However no concert tour was organized in the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons, the only seasons not to have an associated tour.[348] The sixteenth season tour featured the band In Real Life as an opener on select dates.[349]\nIdol Gives Back was a special charity event started in season six featuring performances by celebrities and various fund-raising initiatives. This event was also held in seasons seven and nine and has raised nearly $185 million in total.[95]\nAmerican Idol has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants' performances as well as the winner's coronation single for sale. For the first five seasons, the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season. All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made then American Idol the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program.[350] Starting late in the fifth season, individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads, initially from the American Idol official website only. In the seventh season the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor. In the tenth season the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night.\nOn February 14, 2009, The Walt Disney Company debuted \"The American Idol Experience\" at its Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. In this live production, co-produced by 19 Entertainment, park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the Idol set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real Idol judges, critiqued the performances.[352] Audience members then voted for their favorite performer. There were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a \"finals\" show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner.[353] The winner of the finals show received a \"Dream Ticket\" that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future American Idol audition.[352] The attraction closed on August 30, 2014.[354]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(May 2021)\nAmerican Idol is broadcast to over 100 nations worldwide.[355] In most nations these are not live broadcasts and may be tape delayed by several days or weeks, except for other season finales that are aired live in several countries simulcast with the U.S. broadcast on Fox (2002\u20132016) and ABC (since 2018). In Canada, the first thirteen seasons of American Idol were aired live countrywide by CTV and/or CTV Two, in simulcast with Fox. CTV dropped Idol after its thirteenth season and in August 2014, Yes TV announced that it had picked up Canadian rights to American Idol beginning in its 2015 season.[356][357] In 2017, it was announced the show would return to CTV Two for its sixteenth season.[358] Since season nineteen, the show started airing on Citytv.\nIn Latin America, the show is broadcast and subtitled by Sony Entertainment Television.

In Indonesia, it was aired on RCTI in the 2002 to 2003 season with the Indonesian subtitles, before the Indonesian version of Idols was held in the 2004, aired after each episode ended, and in the 2011 to 2013 season it was broadcast by B-Channel (now RTV). In Australia, it aired a few hours after the U.S. telecast. It was aired on Network Ten from 2002 to 2008 and then again in 2013.

In Italy, the twelfth season was broadcast by La3.[360] In Singapore, The show was broadcast on Mediacorp Channel 5 for the ninth and tenth seasons.\n^American Idol does not have a ranking for the 2001\u20132002 season because it aired in the summer of 2002. If it had aired within the official 2001\u20132002 U.S. television season, the Wednesday results show would have ranked number 25 and the Tuesday performance show would have ranked number 30, assuming it would have had the same rating as it did in the summer.",

        "context": "\nAmerican Idol was based on the British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition Popstars. Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain.[6] Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, including telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows, such as the Eurovision Song Contest), the drama of backstories, and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time.[7]Pop Idol debuted in Britain in 2001 with Lythgoe as showrunner\u200d\u2014\u200cthe executive producer and production leader\u200d\u2014\u200cand Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was successful with the viewing public.[8]\nIn 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the United States, but the idea was initially met with poor responses from all the television networks including Fox.[9] However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was later persuaded to buy the series by his daughter, Elisabeth, who had seen the British show.[9] Although Fox's executives wanted to change the format, Murdoch insisted that it should remain the same as the British one. One change was nevertheless made due to the presence of multiple time zones in the United States that made it impractical for the country to vote in the same time period, an additional half-hour results show was therefore added the day following the performance show.[10] The show was renamed American Idol: The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job of showrunner, but turned down the offer; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to the surprise of Cowell and Fox, it became one of the biggest shows of the summer.[11][12] With its successful launch in the summer, the show was then moved to January and expanded.[13] The show grew into a phenomenon largely due to its personal engagement with the contestants by prompting the viewers to vote, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show on U.S. television, a position it then held for seven consecutive seasons until 2011.[14][15]\nHowever, after a few years of sharp declining ratings starting in 2012, with rating falls of over 20% each season,[16] the fifteenth season would be its last on Fox, ending its run in April 2016.[17] In May 2017, ABC acquired the rights to the series and the program returned for the 2017\u201318 television season.[18][19] The first season of the revived series, or the 16th season overall, started airing in March 2018.[20] Six seasons have been aired on ABC as of May 2023.[21]\nThe show had originally planned on having four judges following the Pop Idol format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell.[9] A fourth judge, radio DJ Stryker, was originally chosen but he dropped out citing \"image concerns.\"[22] In the second season, New York radio personality Angie Martinez had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew only after a few days of auditions due to not being comfortable with giving out criticism.[23] The show decided to continue with the three judges format until the eighth season. All three original judges stayed on the judging panel for eight seasons.\nIn the eighth season, Latin Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge. Abdul left the show in 2009 after the eighth season as a result of failing to agree to terms with the show producers.[24]Emmy Award-winning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul for the ninth season, but left in 2010 after just one season.[25] DioGuardi was let go from American Idol in 2010 after two seasons as producers favored a return to the three-person judge panel previously used prior to DioGuardi's appearance on the show.[26] Cowell also left the show in 2010 to introduce the American version of his show The X Factor for 2011.[27] Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth.\nJennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined the judging panel in the tenth season,[28] but both left in 2012 after two seasons.[29] Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. They were replaced by three new judges, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, and Keith Urban, who joined Jackson in the twelfth season.[30] However, both Carey and Minaj left after one season,[31] and Jackson departed the show after twelve seasons as a judge but would return as a mentor for the thirteenth season in 2014, after which he left the show permanently.[32][33]\nUrban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Lopez returned to American Idol for the thirteenth season and was joined by former mentor Harry Connick Jr.[1] After this, Lopez, Urban, and Connick Jr. remained on the show until its cancellation after the fifteenth season in 2016.[34][35]\nThe first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman following the format of Pop Idol of using two presenters. Dunkleman quit thereafter,[40] resulting in Seacrest becoming the sole host starting with the second season in 2003.\nSeacrest has remained as sole host of American Idol ever since, with the exception of the two-year hiatus between 2016 and 2018 as well as April 8, 2019, when Bobby Bones subbed for Seacrest after the latter fell ill.[41] Dunkleman did, however, return for the initial series finale on Fox in 2016 as a guest.[42]\nThe eligible age-range for contestants is fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in the fourth season, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in the tenth season. The contestants have to be legal U.S. residents, can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons, and must not have held a current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage[43] (in previous years by the audition stage).[44]\nFor the first eighteen seasons, contestants went through at least three sets of cuts. The first was a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these made it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sing in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television.[45] Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10 and 60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood (the average total is between 150 and 200)[citation needed].\nFrom the nineteenth season onwards, contestants request a Zoom interview and audition remotely for the show's producers. If the audition goes well, they will then invite the contestants to audition in front of the judges, in one of the audition cities.[46]\nOnce in Hollywood, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until the tenth season, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood.[47] In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and performed a song together.[48] In the final round, the contestants performed solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band\u200d\u2014\u200cdepending on the season. In the second and third seasons, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In the seventh season, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round.[49] In the twelfth season, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.\nIn the tenth and eleventh seasons, a further round was added in Las Vegas, where the contestants performed in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists.[50][51] At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants were selected to move on to the semi-final stage. In the twelfth season the Las Vegas round became a Sudden Death round, where the judges had to choose five guys and five girls each night (four nights) to make the top twenty.[52] In the thirteenth season, the Las Vegas round was eliminated and a new round called \"Hollywood or Home\" was added, where if the judges were uncertain about some contestants, those contestants were required to perform soon after landing in Los Angeles, and those who failed to impress were sent back home before they reached Hollywood.[53] In the fourteenth season, the \"Hollywood or Home\" round was dropped, and a Showcase round was added, where the contestants performed at the House of Blues or auditorium for the judges and a live audience, and these performances determine who makes into the Top 24.[54] In the seventeenth and eighteenth seasons, the showcase round took place in Hawaii. In the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first seasons, a showstopper round was used.\nFrom the semi-finals onward, the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a toll-free telephone number for each contestant was displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message was registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers were allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window. However, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers.[55] One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges. Over 110 million votes were cast in the first season, and by the tenth season the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million. Voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when AT&T Wireless joined as a sponsor of the show, and 7.5 million text messages were sent to American Idol that season.[56] The number of text messages rapidly increased, reaching 178 million texts by the eighth season.[57] Online voting was offered for the first time in the tenth season. The votes are counted and verified by Telescope Inc.[58]\nIn the first three seasons, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In the first season, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In the second and third seasons, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. These seasons also featured a wildcard round, where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In the first season, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In the second and third seasons, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all.\nFrom the fourth through seventh and ninth seasons, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.\nThe wildcard round returned in the eighth season, wherein there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward \u2013 the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer \u2013 for each night, and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. Starting in tenth season, the girls and boys perform on separate nights. In the tenth and eleventh seasons, five of each gender were chosen, and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13. In the twelfth season, the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups, with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10. In the thirteenth season, there were thirty semifinalists, but only twenty semifinalists (ten for each gender) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows, with five in each gender based on the vote and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13. In the fourteenth season, the top 24 performed at The Fillmore Detroit, starting with the 12 males on one night and then the 12 females on the next night. The following week, the same order went for the top 16, with four males eliminated, followed by four females based on the vote. Then, on the first night of finals, a similar sequence from the thirteenth season was used to determine the final 12, with five of each gender based on the vote and two wildcards chosen by the judges. In the fifteenth season, the top 24 performed at Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in Los Angeles and were split into two groups of twelve and performed twice, one being a solo performance and one being a duet with a former Idol contestant. In each group, the judges chose 7 contestants to advance to the top 14 where the judges chose 4 to advance to the top 10 and remaining 6 contestants were chosen based on the vote. In the sixteenth season, the top 24 performed at the Academy in the Heart of LA, and the show repeated the process from the previous season. However, instead of Idol alumnus as duet partners, superstar celebrity singers were used as the duet partners. In the seventeenth season, the same process was repeated again. However, instead of a top 24, it's a top 20, the contestants performed at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, and performed solos in one episode, and performed the duets in two episodes. In the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the top 20 performed at their homes, and based on the vote, half of the top 20 would advance to the top 10, and the other half would be eliminated. However, a wild card was given to one of the bottom 10 to save them from elimination.[59][60] In the nineteenth season, the show used a combination of the process from the sixteenth and fourteenth seasons. In the twentieth season, the show repeated the process from the previous season, but they used a top 20 instead of a top 16, and there were no all star duets. In the twenty-first season, the same process was repeated, but they started with a top 26 instead of a top 24.\nThe finals are broadcast in primetime from Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience (except the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). From 2002 to 2022, the venue was CBS Television City. Starting in 2023, it changed to Red Studios. The finals lasted eight weeks in the first season. From the second to ninth and fourteenth seasons, the finals lasted eleven weeks. The tenth and eleventh seasons lasted for twelve weeks, while the twelfth season lasted for ten weeks. In the thirteenth season, the finals lasted thirteen weeks. The finals lasted seven weeks in the fifteenth season, and six weeks in the sixteenth season. Each finalist performs songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as Motown, disco, or big band, songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley or The Beatles, or more general themes such as Billboard number-one hits or songs from the contestant's year of birth. Contestants usually worked with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. From the tenth to twelfth seasons, Jimmy Iovine was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sang one song each week, but this was increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.\nThe most popular contestants are usually not revealed in the results show. Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes was called to the center of the stage. One of these three was usually sent to safety; however the two remaining were not necessarily the bottom two.[61] The contestant with the fewest votes was then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant's time on the show was played and they gave their final performance (from the fourteenth season onward, the montage and the final performance were dropped). However, in the sixth season, during the series' first ever Idol Gives Back episode, no contestant was eliminated, but on the following week, two were sent home. Moreover, from the eighth season onwards, the judges may overturn viewers' decision with a \"Judges' Save\" if they unanimously agreed to. \"The save\" could only be used once, and only up through the Top 5. In the eighth to tenth and fourteenth seasons, a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save, but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons, a regular single elimination took place. The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently, a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week.\nThe \"Fan Save\" was introduced in the fourteenth season. During the finals, viewers were given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 8.\nDuring the original run of American Idol on Fox, the finale week consisted of a one-hour long final performance night and a two-hour last episode of the season that culminates in revealing the winner, both of which are broadcast live in the U.S. Eastern and Central time zones. For the first, third through sixth and fourteenth through fifteenth seasons it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The second-season finale took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre, which had an audience capacity of over 6,000. In the seventh through thirteenth seasons, the venue was at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live, which holds an audience of over 7,000. Since the show's reboot on ABC, the venue remains the same throughout the entire show (excluding auditions), but has been stretched to a single three-hour season finale that is annually aired live simultaneously in all U.S. territories. The eighteenth-season finale was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe winner usually receives a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums,[62][63] and secures a management contract with American Idol-affiliated 19 Management (which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts. All winners prior to the ninth season reportedly earned at least $1 million in their first year as winner.[63] At first the contract came with a $250,000-plus advance, but dropped to about $62,500 over the Fox years.[64] All the runners-up of the first ten seasons, as well as some of other finalists, had also received record deals with major labels. However, starting in the eleventh season, the runner-up may only be guaranteed a single-only deal.[65]BMG/Sony (first through ninth seasons), UMG (tenth through fifteenth seasons), and Disney Music Group's Hollywood Records (sixteenth through eighteenth seasons) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season's finale. In the fourteenth and fifteenth seasons, the winner was signed with Big Machine Records. Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants' albums, such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. All top 10 (11 in the tenth and twelfth seasons, 5 in the fourteenth season, and 7 in the sixteenth season) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour, where the participants may each earn a six-figure sum.[66]\n^Owing to the production difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the finale had five contestants instead of three, and the three contestants who failed to place in the top 2 finished in joint-third place.\nEach season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round from the tenth through twelfth seasons), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinals onward the contestants perform their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed during a results segment. The results segment feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results also features homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner of the season is revealed.\nWith the exception of the first two seasons, the contestants in the semifinals onward perform in front of a studio audience. They perform with a full band in the finals. The current musical director is Kris Pooley, who has been with the show since the sixteenth season. In previous seasons, the American Idol band was led by Rickey Minor (fourth through ninth and thirteenth through fifteenth seasons) and Ray Chew (tenth through twelfth seasons). Assistance has also been given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and Debra Byrd to contestants behind the scene. Starting with the seventh season, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onward. In later seasons, the contestants were allowed to perform with a musical instrument in the auditions. During the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays from the tenth through thirteenth seasons, with the tenth, eleventh and thirteenth season finales aired on Tuesday and Wednesday. From the fourteenth season onward, there were no separate results shows. On the fourteenth season, the show aired on Wednesday nights, and on the fifteenth season, Thursday nights. From the sixteenth season onward, it aired on Sundays and Mondays.[citation needed]\nThe first season of American Idol debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell served as judges.\nIn the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital.[67]Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed on his blog, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.[68]\nIn what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, \"A Moment Like This\", went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, From Justin to Kelly, which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become one of the most successful Idol contestants internationally,[70] with worldwide album sales of more than 25 million.[71]\nFollowing the success of the first season, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show's budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Ryan Seacrest as the lone host. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Kristin Adams was a correspondent for this season.[72]\nCorey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation.[73] Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year \u2013 Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and Frenchie Davis for having previously modeled for an adult website.[74]\nThe season finale drew more than 38 million viewers, marking Idol's biggest audience ever for a single episode. Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner, beating Clay Aiken by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through.[75] In an interview prior to the fifth season, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.[76]\nBoth finalists found success after the show, but Aiken out-performed Studdard's coronation song \"Flying Without Wings\" with his single release from the show \"This Is the Night\", as well as in their subsequent album releases. The fourth-place finisher Josh Gracin also enjoyed some success as a country singer.[77]\nThe third season premiered on January 19, 2004. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\" received widespread attention. His exposure on Idol landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third bestselling singer from that season.[78]\nMuch media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated.[79] Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes \"incredibly racist\".[80] The prolonged stays of John Stevens and Jasmine Trias in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke 'blown out of proportion'.[81]\nThe performance of \"Summertime\" by Barrino, later known simply as \"Fantasia\", at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite Idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show.[82] Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single \"I Believe\", a song co-written by the first season finalist Tamyra Gray, and DeGarmo released \"Dreams\".\nThe fourth season premiered on January 18, 2005. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This was the first full season of the series to be aired in high definition; the finale of the third season was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season,[44] and among those who benefited from this new rule were Constantine Maroulis and Bo Bice, the two rockers of the show.\nThe top 12 finalists originally included Mario Vazquez, but he dropped out citing 'personal reasons'[83] and was replaced by Nikko Smith. Later, an employee of Fremantle Media, which produces the show, sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by Vazquez toward him during the show.[84]\nDuring the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.\nIn May 2005, Carrie Underwood was announced the winner, with Bice the runner-up. Both Underwood and Bice released the coronation song \"Inside Your Heaven\", with Underwood's version of the song making her the first country artist ever to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[85] As of 2015, Underwood has become the most successful Idol contestant in the U.S.,[70] selling 16 million albums in the country,[86] while selling a total of 65 million records worldwide.[87]\nThe fifth season began on January 17, 2006. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. It remains the highest-rated season in the show's run so far. Two of the more prominent contestants during the Hollywood round were the Brittenum twins who were later disqualified for identity theft.[88]\nChris Daughtry's performance of Fuel's \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\" on the show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new lead singer, an invitation he declined.[89] His performance of Live's version of \"I Walk the Line\" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters for not crediting the arrangement to Live.[90] He was eliminated at the top four in a shocking result.\nThe sixth season began on Tuesday, January 16, 2007. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The premiere drew a massive audience of 37.3 million viewers, peaking in the last half hour with more than 41 million viewers.[92]\nTeenager Sanjaya Malakar was the season's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo,[93] and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog Vote for the Worst and satellite radio personality Howard Stern, who both encouraged fans to vote for him. However, on the Top 7 results, Sanjaya was voted off.[94]\nThis season saw the first Idol Gives Back telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76 million in corporate and viewer donations.[95] No contestant was eliminated that week, but two (Phil Stacey and Chris Richardson) were eliminated the next.\nThis season also saw the launch of the American Idol Songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the \"coronation song\". Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, \"This Is My Now\", was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by Sparks on May 24, 2007.[96]\nThe seventh season premiered on January 15, 2008, for a two-day, four-hour premiere. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The media focused on the professional status of the seventh season contestants, the so-called 'ringers',[97] many of whom, including Kristy Lee Cook, Brooke White, Michael Johns, and in particular Carly Smithson, had prior recording contracts.[98] Contestant David Hernandez also attracted some attention due to his past employment as a stripper.[99]\nFor the finals, American Idol debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. David Cook's performance of \"Billie Jean\" on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the Chris Cornell arrangement to be David Cook's own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell's version. Cornell himself said he was 'flattered' and praised David Cook's performance.[100] David Cook was taken to the hospital after the top-nine performance show due to heart palpitations and high blood pressure.[101]\nDavid Archuleta's performance of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in the tenth season, called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget.[102]Jason Castro's semi-final performance of \"Hallelujah\" also received considerable attention, and it propelled Jeff Buckley's version of the song to the top of the Billboarddigital song chart.[103] This was the first season in which contestants' recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts.[104]\nIdol Gives Back returned on April 9, 2008, and raised $64 million for charity.[95]\nThe finalists were Cook and Archuleta. David Cook was announced the winner on May 21, 2008, the first rocker to win the show. Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S.[91]\nThe American Idol Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the \"coronation song\". The winning song, \"The Time of My Life\", was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008.\nThe eighth season premiered on January 13, 2009. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This season featured the first major change to the judging panel; a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced. Mike Darnell, the president of alternative programming for Fox, stated that the season would focus more on the contestants' personal life.[105]\nThis was also the first season without executive producer Nigel Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show So You Think You Can Dance.[106] The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. Idol Gives Back was canceled for this season due to the global recession at the time.\nThere were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the \"Judges' Save\", and Matt Giraud was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated.\nThe two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since the second season. It was claimed,[107] and then later retracted,[108] that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from Allen's home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.[109]\nBoth Allen and Lambert released the coronation song, \"No Boundaries\" which was co-written by DioGuardi. This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status.[110]\nThe ninth season premiered on January 12, 2010. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Kara DioGuardi, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Paula Abdul left the show and Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week. One of the most prominent auditioners this season was General Larry Platt whose performance of \"Pants on the Ground\" became a viral hit song.[111]\nCrystal Bowersox, who has Type-I diabetes, fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized.[112] The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer, wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.[112]\nMichael Lynche was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges' Save. The next week Katie Stevens and Andrew Garcia were eliminated. That week, Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first Idol alum to do so. Idol Gives Back returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised $45 million.[95]\nA special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show's past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.\nThe final two contestants were Lee DeWyze and Bowersox. DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song \u2013 DeWyze chose U2's \"Beautiful Day\", and Bowersox chose Patty Griffin's \"Up to the Mountain\". This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.[113]\nThe tenth season premiered on January 19, 2011. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the American version of The X Factor), Kara DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres, who left the show on her own accord.[114][28]\nRandy Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth. Nigel Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the new partner of American Idol, acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors,[28] although in later episodes special guest mentors such as Beyonc\u00e9, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in.\nThe tenth season is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40-second video audition via Myspace.[115]Karen Rodriguez was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds.\nOne of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina, whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fianc\u00e9e received widespread coverage.[116] Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. Casey Abrams, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. In the following week, Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated.\nPia Toscano, one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticisms from some former Idol contestants, as well as actor Tom Hanks.[117] After Idol, Jennifer Lopez helped guide her career.[118]\nThe two finalists in 2011 were Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery, both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win American Idol. McCreery released his first single, \"I Love You This Big\", as his coronation song, and Alaina released \"Like My Mother Does\". McCreery's debut album, Clear as Day, became the first debut album by an Idol winner to reach No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 since Ruben Studdard's Soulful in 2003, and he became the youngest male artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200.[119]\nThe eleventh season premiered on January 18, 2012. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, and Randy Jackson returned as judges. One more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25, which was later revealed to be Jermaine Jones. However, on March 14, Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants. Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests.[120]\nFinalist Phillip Phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to the hospital before the Top 13 results show, and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones.[121] He was reported to have eight surgeries during his Idol run, and had considered quitting the show due to the pain.[122] He underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished.[123]\nJessica Sanchez received the fewest votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their \"save\" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, Colton Dixon was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.\nPhillips became the winner, beating Sanchez. During the finale, fifth season finalist Ace Young proposed marriage to third season runner-up Diana DeGarmo on stage \u2013 which she accepted.[124]\nPhillips released \"Home\" as his coronation song, while Sanchez released \"Change Nothing\". Phillips' \"Home\" has since become the best selling of all coronation songs, with over 5 million copies sold.[125][126]\nThe twelfth season premiered on January 16, 2013. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. Randy Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. This season's judging panel consisted of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj.\nThis was the first season since the ninth season to have four judges on the panel. The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to TMZ.[127]\nThe top 10 contestants started with five males and five females, however, the males were eliminated consecutively in the first five weeks, with Lazaro Arbos the last male to be eliminated. For the first time in the show's history, the top 5 contestants were all female. It was also the first time that the judges' \"save\" was not used, the top four contestants were therefore given an extra week to perform again with their votes carried over with no elimination in the first week.\n23-year-old Candice Glover won the season with Kree Harrison taking the runner-up spot. Glover is the first female to win American Idol since Jordin Sparks. Glover released \"I Am Beautiful\" as a single while Harrison released \"All Cried Out\" immediately after the show. Glover sold poorly with her debut album, and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label.[128]\nTowards the end of the season, Randy Jackson, the last remaining of the original judges, announced he would no longer serve as a judge to pursue other business ventures.[32] Both judges Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj also decided to leave after one season to focus on their music careers.[31]\nThe thirteenth season premiered on January 15, 2014. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Keith Urban returned as a judge. Urban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Randy Jackson returned, though Jackson moved from the judging panel to the role of in-mentor. Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj left the panel after one season. Former judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick, Jr. joined Urban on the panel. Connick Jr. served as a mentor for Idol in 2010 and 2012.[129] Also, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick were replaced as executive producers by Per Blankens, Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Pragger. Bill DeRonde replaced Warwick as a director of the audition episodes, while Louis J. Horvitz replaced Gregg Gelfand as a director of the show.[130]\nThis was the first season where the contestants were permitted to perform in the final rounds songs they wrote themselves. In the Top 8, Sam Woolf received the fewest votes, but he was saved from elimination by the judges. The 500th episode of the series was the Top 3 performance night.[131]\nThe fourteenth season premiered on January 7, 2015. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick, Jr. returned for their respective fourth, third and second seasons as judges. Eighth season runner-up Adam Lambert filled in for Urban during the New York City auditions. Randy Jackson did not return as the in-house mentor and left the show permanently.[134]Scott Borchetta replaced Jackson as the mentor.\nChanges this season include only airing one episode a week during the final ten.[135] Coca-Cola ended their longtime sponsorship of the show[136] and Ford Motor Company maintained a reduced role. The winner of the season also received a recording contract with Big Machine Records.\nNick Fradiani won the season, defeating Clark Beckham. Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region. Fradiani released \"Beautiful Life\" as his coronation single while Beckham released \"Champion\". Jax, the third place finalist, also released a single called \"Forcefield\".\nFox announced on May 11, 2015, that the fifteenth season would be the final season of American Idol; as such, the season was expected to have an additional focus on the program's alumni. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, with Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez all returning as judges.[17] The fifteenth season premiered on January 6, 2016. The season was shortened by four weeks compared to previous years.[137] During the finale episode, President Barack Obama praised the millions of young people that voted for contestants and pitched that they vote in the upcoming election. The farewell season concluded on April 7, 2016. Seacrest signed off by saying: \"And one more time\u2014this is so tough\u2014we say to you from Hollywood, goodnight America\", and then he added, \"for now.\"[138]\nIn early 2017, Variety reported that Fremantle Media was in talks to revive the show for NBC or for its original network, Fox.[142] A dispute between Fremantle and Core Media Group derailed these plans.[143] In May 2017, ABC was making a bid to revive the program.[144] ABC acquired the rights to the series, and American Idol returned for the 2017\u201318 television season.[145][146]\nIn July 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would return as host,[147] and by September 2017 it was revealed that Katy Perry,[36]Luke Bryan[37] and Lionel Richie would serve as judges.[38][148] The sixteenth season premiered on March 11, 2018.[20] This was the first season of American Idol to air on ABC. The season was again shortened compared to the previous season to twelve weeks, with multiple elimination in the final rounds. Unlike previous seasons where only two finalists remained in the final episode, three finalists performed in the finale. On May 21, 2018, the season concluded with Maddie Poppe crowned the winner, beating Caleb Lee Hutchinson as runner-up and Gabby Barrett in third place. Her winning song was \"Going, Going, Gone\". Caleb Lee Hutchinson released \"Johnny Cash Heart\" as a single, while Gabby Barrett's song was \"Rivers Deep\".[149]\nABC renewed the revival series for another season. Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[150] The seventeenth season premiered on March 3, 2019. For the finale, the show no longer features separate performance and result shows. On May 19, 2019, the season concluded with three finalists, with Madison VanDenburg eliminated in third place after performing two songs, and the final two performing their last song. For the first time, there were no separate performance and grand finale shows this season. Laine Hardy was crowned the winner and Alejandro Aranda runner-up. Hardy released a single, \"Flame\", immediately after the win, but Aranda did not.[151][152] However, Aranda later released a song he performed in the finale, \"Tonight\", under the name Scarypoolparty on June 28, 2019.[153]\nOn May 13, 2019, the series was renewed for an eighteenth season and it premiered on February 16, 2020.[154][155] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[156] For the first time, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, from the top 20 to the finale, the contestants performed in their own homes, while Ryan Seacrest hosted the show remotely in his own home in Los Angeles with the judges also in their respective homes.[60][157] The season was also further truncated, with the top 5 performing in the finale. Each finalist also performed only two songs for the finale.[158] On May 17, the season concluded, with Just Sam crowned as the winner, with Arthur Gunn finishing as the runner-up.[159] \"Rise Up\", the song Just Sam performed for their audition and reprised on the finale, was released as their debut song.[160][161]\nOn May 15, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a nineteenth season and it premiered on February 14, 2021.[162][163] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[164] Later in October, it was announced that Bobby Bones will return as mentor. On May 23, the season concluded, with Chayce Beckham crowned the winner, with Willie Spence finishing as the runner-up. \"23\", the song Chayce Beckham wrote and performed for Top 4, was released as his debut song.[21]\nOn May 13, 2021, ABC renewed the series for a twentieth season and it premiered on February 27, 2022.[165][166] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.[167] On December 31, it was announced that Bones would not be returning as a mentor.[168] On May 22, the season concluded, with Noah Thompson crowned as the winner, with HunterGirl finishing as the runner-up. \"One Day Tonight\", the song Noah Thompson performed for the Grand Finale, was released as his debut song.\nOn May 13, 2022, ABC renewed the series for a twenty-first season and it premiered on February 19, 2023.[169][170] Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges. On May 21, the season concluded, with Iam Tongi crowned as the winner, with Megan Danielle finishing as the runner-up.\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of American Idol. It holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in the Nielsen annual television ratings; it became the highest-rated of all television programs in the United States overall for an unprecedented seven consecutive years,[173] or eight consecutive (and total) years when either its performance or result show was ranked number one overall.[5]\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\nAmerican Idol premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002. The first show drew 9.9 million viewers, giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30 pm spot in over a year.[239] The audience steadily grew, and by finale night, the audience had averaged 23 million, with more than 40 million watching some part of that show.[240] That episode was placed third amongst all age groups, but more importantly it led in the 18\u201349 demographic, the age group most valued by advertisers.[12]\nThe growth continued into the next season, starting with a season premiere of 26.5 million.[174] The season attracted an average of 21.7 million viewers, and was placed second overall amongst the 18\u201349 age group.[241] The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest-rated ever American Idol episode at 38.1 million for the final hour.[242] By the third season, the show had become the top show in the 18\u201349 demographic[242] a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including the tenth season, and its competition stages ranked first in the nationwide overall ratings. By the fourth season, American Idol had become the most-watched series amongst all viewers on American TV for the first time, with an average viewership of 26.8 million.[243] The show reached its peak in the fifth season with numbers averaging 30.6 million per episode, and this season remains the highest-rated of the series.[243]\nThe sixth season premiered with the series' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most-watched episodes of American Idol. During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before,[3] as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC's The Cosby Show. The show was dubbed \"the Death Star\",[92] and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses.[3] However, the sixth season also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year. The sixth season was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second-highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.[242]\nThe loss of viewers continued into the seventh season. The premiere was down 11% among total viewers,[174] and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest-rated Wednesday show among the 18\u201334 demo since the first season in 2002.[244] However, the ratings rebounded for the seventh-season finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids, and improved over the sixth season as the series' third most watched finale. The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most watched TV network in the country for the first time since its inception, a first ever in American television history for a non-Big Three major broadcast network.[245] Overall ratings for the season were down 10% from the sixth season,[246] which is in line with the fall in viewership across all networks due in part to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike.[247]\nThe declining trend however continued into the eighth season, as total viewers numbers fell by 5\u201310% for early episodes compared to the seventh season,[248] and by 9% for the finale.[175] In the ninth season, Idol's six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken, when NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 17 beat Idol in the same time slot with 30.1 million viewers over Idol's 18.4 million.[249] Nevertheless, American Idol overall finished its ninth season as the most watched TV series for the sixth year running, breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by CBS' All in the Family and NBC's The Cosby Show.[250]\nIn the tenth season, the total viewer numbers for the first week of shows fell 12\u201313%, and by up to 23% in the 18\u201349 demo compared to the ninth season.[196] Later episodes, however, retained viewers better, and the season ended on a high with a significant increase in viewership for the finale \u2013 up 12% for the adults 18\u201349 demographic and a 21% increase in total viewers from the ninth-season finale.[251] While the overall viewer number has increased this season, its viewer demographics have continued to age year on year \u2013 the median age this season was 47.2 compared to a median age of 32.1 in its first season.[252] The demographics also became \"whiter\" over time and less diverse.[253] Nevertheless, in the 2010\u201311 television season, Fox maintained its lead on over other networks with its seventh consecutive season of victory overall in the 18\u201349 demographic ratings in the United States.\nThe eleventh season, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as The Voice and The X Factor.[254] The ratings for the first two episodes of the eleventh season fell 16\u201321% in overall viewer numbers and 24\u201327% in the 18/49 demo,[200] while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18\u201349 demo.[201] The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. For the first time in eight years, American Idol lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to NBC Sunday Night Football, although the strengths of Idol in its second year in the Wednesday-Thursday primetime slots helped Fox achieve the longest period of 18\u201349 demographic victory in the Nielsen ratings, standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012.[202]\nThe loss of viewers continued into the twelfth season, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18\u201349 demo.[255] The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18\u201349 demo.[256] The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season.[257] The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18\u201349 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and American Idol lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013\u201314 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, and never regained its Top 10 position by the series' end in 2016.[34]\nThe continuing decline influenced further changes for the fourteenth season, including the loss of Coca-Cola as the show's major sponsor, and a decision to only broadcast one, two-hour show per week during the top 12 rounds (with results from the previous week integrated into the performance show, rather than having a separate results show).[258][35][259] On May 11, 2015, prior to the fourteenth-season finale, Fox announced that the fifteenth season of American Idol would be its last.[17] Despite these changes, the show's ratings would decline more sharply. The fourteenth-season finale was the lowest-rated finale ever, with an average of only 8.03 million viewers watching the finale. The show's ratings, however, rebounded in its final season and ended its run in 2016 as Fox's first-ever program to conclude its run without dropping from the Nielsen Top 30 most-watched television shows in each of its seasons.\nFor the revived series on ABC, the ratings were lower but remained stable compared to previous seasons on Fox. The finale of the seventeenth season was slightly more watched than the sixteenth.[260]\nEarly reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\".[261] Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\".[12] It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\",[262] and \"a romp in humiliation\".[263] Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted,[264] and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\".[265] The decision to send the first season winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"[266]\nSome of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of Entertainment Weekly, thought that \"for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, Idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business.\"[267] Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show \"undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism\".[268] Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has \"reshaped the American songbook\", \"led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture\", and connects \"the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future.\"[269] Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that \"Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him.\"[270] Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self-respect.[271]\nSome in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show. Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the \"true art form of music\", thought that shows like American Idol made it seem \"so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight\", and that \"television is a lie\".[272] Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol \"isn't really about music. It's about all the bad aspects of the music business \u2013 the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.' \"[273] That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that \"Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award\".[274] It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol, commenting on talent shows in general, said that \"there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs\".[275]American Idol revolutionized American pop culture and the pop idol process and has provided an opportunity for many to bypass the small club scene and allow a much larger audience to participate in and select the next potential chart topping performer.[276]\nThe success of the show's alumni, however, has led to a more positive assessment of the show, and the show was described as having \"proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records\".[277] While the industry is divided on the show success, its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format.[278] According to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, \"if you want to try and get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV, Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone\", and that country music and Idol \"go together well\".[279]\nThroughout the series, twelve of the seventeen Idol winners, including its first five, had come from the Southern United States.[284] A large number of other finalists during the series' run have also hailed from the American South, including Clay Aiken, Kellie Pickler, and Chris Daughtry,[284] who are all from North Carolina. In 2012, an analysis of the 131 contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that 48% have some connection to the Southern United States.[285]\nThe show itself was popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch American Idol during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as Kentucky, were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series.[284] Data from Nielsen SoundScan, a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47 million CDs sold by Idol contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.[284]\nTheories given for the success of Southerners on Idol have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the Bible Belt, where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing.[284][286][287] Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride.[288] According to fifth season winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of Alabama, \"People in the South have a lot of pride ... So, they're adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region.\"[284]\nFor five consecutive seasons, starting in the seventh season, the title was given to a white male who plays the guitar \u2013 a trend that Idol pundits call the \"White guy with guitar\" or \"WGWG\" factor.[289] Just hours before the eleventh-season finale, where Phillip Phillips was named the winner, Richard Rushfield, author of the book American Idol: The Untold Story, said, \"You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it, not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star competing on the contemporary radio, but as .... who's the nicest guy in a popularity contest\", he says, \"And that has led to this dynasty of four, and possibly now five, consecutive, affable, very nice, good-looking white boys.\"[289]\nSome fans call the final performance of the night the \"pimp spot\" because it usually receives a big boost in votes, due to the recency effect. By performing first, a performer may benefit from the primacy effect, but any other early performance may be stifled. The second performance spot is sometimes called the \"un-pimp spot\" because it is the least beneficial.[290]\nThe show was criticized in earlier seasons over the onerous contract contestants had to sign that gave excessive control to 19 Entertainment over their future careers[291] and handed a large part of their future earnings to the management.[292][293]\nIndividual contestants have generated controversy in this competition for their past actions[74][294] or for being 'ringers' planted by the producers.[97] A number of contestants have been disqualified for various reasons, such as for having an existing contract or undisclosed criminal record, although the show has also been accused of a double standard for disqualifying some but not others.[295]\nVoting results have been a consistent source of controversy. The mechanism of voting has aroused considerable criticism, most notably in the second season when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote,[75] and in the eighth season, when the massive increase in text votes[57] fueled the texting controversy.[109] Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the first season.[296] Since 2004, votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol and Vote for the Worst.[citation needed]\nThe enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated were transformative for the Fox Broadcasting Company. American Idol and other shows such as Survivor and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire were credited for expanding reality television programming in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, and Idol became the most watched non-scripted primetime television series, which it remained for almost a decade, from 2003 to 2012, breaking records on U.S. television (dominated by drama shows and sitcoms in the preceding decades).[297]\nThe show pushed Fox to become the number one U.S. TV network among adults aged 18\u201349,[298] the key demographic coveted by advertisers, for an unprecedented eight consecutive years by 2012.[299] Its success also helped lift the ratings of other shows that were scheduled around it such as House and Bones, and Idol, for years, was Fox's strongest platform primetime television program for promoting eventual hit shows of the 2010s (of the same network) such as Glee, New Girl and Empire.[3] The show, its creator Simon Fuller claimed, \"saved Fox\".[300]\nAs one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, American Idol has had a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment.[305][306] It helped create a number of highly successful recording artists, such as Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Carrie Underwood, as well as others of varying notability. The alumni of the show have received between them 54 Grammy nominations and 13 Grammy awards by 2016, with Carrie Underwood winning seven.[307][308]\nVarious American Idol alumni had success on various record charts around the world; in the U.S. they had achieved 345 number ones on the Billboardcharts in its first 10 years,[4] and 458 by its last year of broadcast in 2016, with 100 achieved by Kelly Clarkson alone.[309] According to Fred Bronson, author of books on the Billboard charts, no other entity has ever created as many hit-making artists and bestselling albums and singles.[310] In 2007, American Idol alums accounted for 2.1% of all music sales.[311] Its alumni have a massive impact on radio; in 2007, American Idol had become \"a dominant force in radio\" according to Rich Meyer, president of the radio station monitoring research company Mediabase.[312] By 2010, four winners each had more than a million radio spins, with Kelly Clarkson leading the field with over four million spins.[313]\nAt the end of the show's run on Fox in 2016, Idol's contestants have sold more than 60 million albums in the US, resulting in more than 80 Platinum records and 95 Gold records. Its participants have generated more than 450 Billboard No. 1 hits and sold more than 260 million digital downloads.[314]\nThe impact of American Idol was also strongly felt in musical theater, where many of Idol alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former American Idol contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on.[315][316] The casting of a popular Idol contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd,[317] won a role in Dreamgirls and eventually went on to win an Academy Award for her performance. She later became the show's first and only alumnus ever to win the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony).\nThe dominance of American Idol in the ratings had made it the most profitable show in U.S. TV for many years. The show was estimated to generate $900 million for the year 2004 through sales of TV ads, albums, merchandise and concert tickets.[300] By the seventh season, the show was estimated to earn around $900 million from its ad revenue alone, not including ancillary sponsorship deals and other income.[320][321] One estimate puts the total TV revenue for the first eight seasons of American at $6.4 billion.[322] Sponsors that bought fully integrated packages can expect a variety of promotions of their products on the show, such as product placement, adverts and product promotion integrated into the show, and various promotional opportunities.[323] Other off-air promotional partners pay for the rights to feature \"Idol\" branding on their packaging, products and marketing programs.[324]American Idol also partnered with Disney in its theme park attraction The American Idol Experience.\nAmerican Idol became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting the fourth season,[325] and by the next season, it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series, selling over $700,000 for a 30-seconds slot,[326] and reaching up to $1.3 million for the finale.[327] Its ad prices reached a peak in the seventh season at $737,000.[321] Estimated revenue more than doubled from $404 million in the third season to $870 million in the sixth season.[328] While that declined from the eighth season onwards, it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor,[329][330] with advertising revenue topping $800 million annually the next few seasons.[331] However, the sharp drop in ratings in the eleventh season also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for the twelfth season, and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers.[332] By 2014, ad revenue from had fallen to $427 million where a 30-second spot went for less than $300,000.[333] For the relaunched Idol on ABC, it has been reported that a 30-second spot may cost between $120,000\u2013$160,000.[334]\nFord Motor Company and Coca-Cola were two of the first sponsors of American Idol in its first season. The sponsorship deal cost around $10 million in the first season,[335] rising to $35 million by the seventh season,[324] and between $50 to $60 million in the tenth season.[336] The third major sponsor AT&T Wireless joined in the second season but ended after the twelfth season, and Coca-Cola officially ended its sponsorship after the thirteenth season amidst the declining ratings of Idol in the mid-2010s. iTunes sponsored the show since the seventh season.\nAmerican Idol prominent display of its sponsors' logo and products had been noted since the early seasons.[12][240] By the sixth season, Idol showed 4,349 product placements according to Nielsen Media Research.[337] The branded entertainment integration proved beneficial to its advertisers \u2013 promotion of AT&T text-messaging as a means to vote successfully introduced the technology into the wider culture,[56][338] and Coca-Cola has seen its equity increased during the show.[339]\nCoca-Cola \u2013 Cups bearing logo of Coca-Cola, and occasionally its subsidiary Vitaminwater,[340] are featured prominently on the judges table. Contestants are shown between songs held in the \"Coca-Cola Red Room\", the show's equivalent of the green room. (The Coca-Cola logo however is obscured during rebroadcast in the UK which until 2011 banned product placement.[341])\nFord \u2013 Contestants appear in the special Ford videos on the results shows, and winners Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Hicks, and Kris Allen have also appeared in commercials for Ford.[323] The final two each won a free Ford Mustang in the fourth through sixth seasons, Ford Escape Hybrid in the seventh season, Ford Fusion Hybrid in the eighth season, Ford Fiesta in the ninth season, and 2013 Ford Fusion in the eleventh season. In the tenth season Scotty McCreery chose a Ford F-150 and Lauren Alaina chose Shelby Mustang. In the red room, there is a glass table with a Ford wheel as its base.\nAT&T \u2013 AT&T Mobility is promoted as the service provider for text-voting. AT&T created an ad campaign that centered on an air-headed teenager going around telling people to vote.\nPrevious sponsors include Old Navy and Clairol's Herbal Essences. In the second and third seasons, contestants sometimes donned Old Navy clothing for their performances with celebrity stylist Steven Cojocaru assisting with their wardrobe selection,[342] and contestants received Clairol-guided hair makeovers. In the seventh-season finale, both David Cook and David Archuleta appeared in \"Risky Business\"-inspired commercials for Guitar Hero, a sponsor of the tour that year.\nCoca-Cola's archrival PepsiCo declined to sponsor American Idol at the show's start. What the Los Angeles Times later called \"missing one of the biggest marketing opportunities in a generation\" contributed to Pepsi losing market share, by 2010 falling to third place from second in the United States. PepsiCo sponsored the American version of Cowell's The X Factor in hopes of not repeating its Idol mistake until its cancellation.[343]\nThe top ten (eleven in the tenth season, five in the fourteenth season, and seven in the sixteenth season) toured at the end of every season except for the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons.[345][346] In the twelfth season tour a semi-finalist who won a sing-off was also added to the tour. Kellogg's Pop-Tarts was the sponsor for the first seven seasons, and Guitar Hero was added for the seventh season tour. M&M's Pretzel Chocolate Candies was a sponsor of the ninth season tour. The fifth season tour was the most successful tour with gross of over $35 million.[347] However no concert tour was organized in the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons, the only seasons not to have an associated tour.[348] The sixteenth season tour featured the band In Real Life as an opener on select dates.[349]\nIdol Gives Back was a special charity event started in season six featuring performances by celebrities and various fund-raising initiatives. This event was also held in seasons seven and nine and has raised nearly $185 million in total.[95]\nAmerican Idol has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants' performances as well as the winner's coronation single for sale. For the first five seasons, the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season. All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made then American Idol the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program.[350] Starting late in the fifth season, individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads, initially from the American Idol official website only. In the seventh season the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor. In the tenth season the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night.\nOn February 14, 2009, The Walt Disney Company debuted \"The American Idol Experience\" at its Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. In this live production, co-produced by 19 Entertainment, park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the Idol set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real Idol judges, critiqued the performances.[352] Audience members then voted for their favorite performer. There were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a \"finals\" show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner.[353] The winner of the finals show received a \"Dream Ticket\" that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future American Idol audition.[352] The attraction closed on August 30, 2014.[354]\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(May 2021)\nAmerican Idol is broadcast to over 100 nations worldwide.[355] In most nations these are not live broadcasts and may be tape delayed by several days or weeks, except for other season finales that are aired live in several countries simulcast with the U.S. broadcast on Fox (2002\u20132016) and ABC (since 2018). In Canada, the first thirteen seasons of American Idol were aired live countrywide by CTV and/or CTV Two, in simulcast with Fox. CTV dropped Idol after its thirteenth season and in August 2014, Yes TV announced that it had picked up Canadian rights to American Idol beginning in its 2015 season.[356][357] In 2017, it was announced the show would return to CTV Two for its sixteenth season.[358] Since season nineteen, the show started airing on Citytv.\nIn Latin America, the show is broadcast and subtitled by Sony Entertainment Television. In Southeast Asia, it is broadcast by Sony Channel every Monday and Tuesday nine or ten hours after since its revival. In Philippines, it is aired every Thursday and Friday nine or ten hours after its United States telecast; from 2004 to 2007 on ABC 5; 2008\u201311 on QTV, then GMA News TV; and 2012\u201316, 2018\u201319 on ETC. In Indonesia, it was aired on RCTI in the 2002 to 2003 season with the Indonesian subtitles, before the Indonesian version of Idols was held in the 2004, aired after each episode ended, and in the 2011 to 2013 season it was broadcast by B-Channel (now RTV). In Australia, it aired a few hours after the U.S. telecast. It was aired on Network Ten from 2002 to 2008 and then again in 2013. Between 2008 and 2012 it aired on Fox8 and the thirteenth and fourteenth seasons (2014\u201315) it aired on digital channel, Eleven, a sister channel to Network Ten. Its final season (2016) aired on Fox8 hours after the original U.S. broadcast. The show enjoyed a lot of popularity in Australia throughout the 2000s before declining in the ratings.[359] In the United Kingdom, episodes were aired one day after the U.S. broadcast on digital channel ITV2. In the twelfth season, the episodes aired on 5*. It was also aired in Ireland on TV3 two days after the telecast. In Brazil and Israel, the show airs two days after its original broadcast, and broadcast live during the season finale. In the instances where the airing is delayed, the shows may sometimes be combined into one episode to summarize the results. In Italy, the twelfth season was broadcast by La3.[360] In Singapore, The show was broadcast on Mediacorp Channel 5 for the ninth and tenth seasons.\n^American Idol does not have a ranking for the 2001\u20132002 season because it aired in the summer of 2002. If it had aired within the official 2001\u20132002 U.S. television season, the Wednesday results show would have ranked number 25 and the Tuesday performance show would have ranked number 30, assuming it would have had the same rating as it did in the summer.",

        "context": "\nThe festival's origins trace back to a 1993 concert that Pearl Jam performed at the Empire Polo Club while boycotting venues controlled by Ticketmaster. The show validated the site's viability for hosting large events, leading to the inaugural Coachella Festival being held over the course of two days in October 1999, three months after Woodstock '99. After no event was held in 2000, Coachella returned on an annual basis beginning in April 2001 as a single-day event. In 2002, the festival reverted to a two-day format. Coachella was expanded to a third day in 2007 and eventually a second weekend in 2012; it is now held on consecutive three-day weekends in April, with the same lineup each weekend. Organizers began permitting spectators to camp on the grounds in 2003, one of several expansions and additions in the festival's history. The festival was not held in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[3]\nCoachella showcases popular and established musical artists as well as emerging artists and reunited groups. It is one of the largest, most famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and the world.[4][5] Each Coachella staged from 2013 to 2015 set new records for festival attendance and gross revenues. The 2017 festival was attended by 250,000 people and grossed $114.6 million. Coachella's success led to Goldenvoice establishing additional music festivals at the site, including the annual Stagecoachcountry music festival beginning in 2007, the Big 4 thrash metal festival in 2011, and the classic rock-oriented Desert Trip in 2016.\nEven before we looked at [Empire Polo Club], it hit us. We wanted it to be far. So you surrender. So you can't leave your house and see a couple bands and be back home that night. We want you to go out there, get tired, and curse the show by Sunday afternoon. That sunset, and that whole feeling of Coachella hits you.\nOn November 5, 1993, Pearl Jam performed for almost 25,000 fans at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.[7] The site was selected because the band refused to play in Los Angeles as a result of a dispute with Ticketmaster over service charges applied to ticket purchases.[8][9] The show established the polo club's suitability for large-scale events; Paul Tollett, whose concert promotion company Goldenvoice booked the venue for Pearl Jam, said the concert sowed the seeds for an eventual music festival there.[6]\nAround 1997, Goldenvoice was struggling to book concerts against larger companies, and they were unable to offer guarantees as high as their competitors, such as SFX Entertainment. Tollett said, \"We were getting our ass kicked financially. We were losing a lot of bands. And we couldn't compete with the money.\"[10] As a result, the idea of a music festival was conceived, and Tollett began to brainstorm ideas for one with multiple venues. His intent was to book trendy artists who were not necessarily chart successes: \"Maybe if you put a bunch of them together, that might be a magnet for a lot of people.\"[8] While attending the 1997 Glastonbury Festival, Tollett handed out pamphlets to artists and talent managers that featured pictures of the Empire Polo Club and pitched a possible festival there. In contrast to the frequently muddy conditions at Glastonbury caused by rain, he recalled, \"We had this pamphlet... showing sunny Coachella. Everyone was laughing.\"[9]\nAfter scouting several sites for their festival,[6] Tollett and Goldenvoice co-president Rick Van Santen returned to the Empire Polo Club during the Big Gig festival in 1998. Impressed by the location's suitability for a festival, they decided to book their event there.[8] The promoters had hoped to stage their inaugural festival in 1998 but were unable to until the following year.[9] On July 16, 1999, Goldenvoice announced that the Indio City Council had approved the festival and would provide $90,000 for services such as traffic control and public safety. The funds came with a guarantee of repayment from the promoter, as the city was keen to avoid incurring another loss; the previous year's Big Gig festival cost Indio $16,000 due to last-minute changes to the lineup and poor attendance.[11] The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was officially announced on July 28 with a preliminary lineup of 40 acts;[12] tickets went on sale on August 7.[13]\nCoachella's announcement came just one week after the conclusion of Woodstock '99, a festival in July 1999 that was marred by looting, arson, violence, and rapes. Goldenvoice's insurance costs increased 40% as a result and the company faced uncertainty regarding Coachella's tickets.[9][14] Organizers were already aiming to provide a \"high-comfort festival experience\" for Coachella but rededicated themselves to those efforts after Woodstock '99. Advertisements boasted free water fountains, ample restrooms, and misting tents.[14] Retrospectively, Tollett called the decision to announce a new festival just two months prior to staging it \"financial suicide\".[9]\nOn October 9\u201310, 1999, the inaugural Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was held. Headlining the event were Beck, Tool, and Rage Against the Machine; other acts included the Chemical Brothers, Morrissey, A Perfect Circle, Jurassic 5 and Underworld. Originally, promoters had hoped to make the event three days (Friday to Sunday) and even considered the UK group Massive Attack as the third-day headliner.[15] The organizers strove to recreate European music festivals with small crowds in a great setting with plenty of turntables.[16] By booking acts based on artistry rather than radio popularity, Coachella earned the title of \"the anti-Woodstock\".[17]\nTickets sold for $50 for each day; about 17,000 tickets sold for the first day, and 20,000 for the second,[16] falling short of the overall attendance goal of 70,000.[18] Attendees were offered free parking and a free bottle of water upon entrance.[16] The event went smoothly, with the well-behaved crowd starkly contrasting with the violence that plagued Woodstock '99; the biggest challenges to Coachella concertgoers were temperatures exceeding 100 \u00b0F and the decisions of which of the 80-plus acts to attend.[17][18][19] The festival was well regarded among attendees and critics; Pollstar named it festival of the year, and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said that it \"laid the foundation for what someday may be a legacy of its own\".[20][21] However, Goldenvoice lost $850,000 on the undertaking,[22] forcing the promoter, in Tollett's words, to \"struggle for almost two years to survive as a company\".[23] Prominent acts, including the headliners, agreed to receive deferred compensation.[24]\nGoldenvoice reserved tentative dates for October 2000 to reprise the festival,[25] but ultimately canceled for that year; Tollett blamed it on the oversaturation of music festivals in Southern California.[20] Instead, Goldenvoice partnered with promoter Pasquale Rotella to stage the electronic dance music festival Nocturnal Wonderland at the Empire Polo Club in September 2000.[26][27]\nGoldenvoice opted to bring Coachella back in April 2001 in an attempt to beat the heat.[20][28] Ticket prices were raised to $65.[29] Organizers encountered difficulty booking acts for the festival and due to \"available talent\", were forced to shorten the festival to a single day.[30] Issues with securing a headliner threatened to doom the event until Perry Farrell agreed to bring his reunited group Jane's Addiction to the proceedings.[31] Amidst financial concerns, Tollett agreed to sell Goldenvoice to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) in March 2001 for $7 million.[32] AEG, which had opened Staples Center in Los Angeles two years prior, purchased the promoter to help them find shows to book. The corporation wanted Tollett to continue staging Coachella, understanding that it initially would lose money;[9] Tollett initially retained full control of Coachella as a result of the acquisition.[31][33] Like its predecessor, the 2001 festival went smoothly;[23] 32,000 people attended,[26] and despite taking a loss again, Tollett estimates it was a \"low, low six-figure sum\".[23]\nFor its third outing, Coachella reverted to a two-day format and took place from April 27\u201328, 2002. Tollett said that the event was expanded to a second day after more acts began expressing interest in participating.[34] With around 60 artists performing,[35] the festival featured headliners Bj\u00f6rk and Oasis, along with a reunion of Siouxsie and the Banshees.[36] Palm Desert natives Queens of the Stone Age became the first local band to play the festival.[22] Multiple changes were made for that year: one less tent was used,[37] reducing the number of stages from five to four,[34] and a fence in the middle of the polo field was removed to increase the openness of the site.[37] The strong supporting acts helped prove to the Indio community that the event could bring in money and take place without conflict. More than 55,000 people attended over the two days,[22] and for the first time, the festival nearly broke even.[23]\nThe 2003 festival took place from April 26\u201327.[10] Among the 82 acts booked by Goldenvoice were headliners Red Hot Chili Peppers and Beastie Boys, as well as a reunited Iggy Pop and the Stooges. Performances were held on two outdoor stages and in three tents.[38] Ticket prices remained $75 per day, but were increased to $140 for a two-day pass.[10] For the first time, on-site camping was offered;[39] the Indio City Council approved overnight camping at the site, permitting up to four people on each of the 2,252 camping spots.[40] The festival drew 60,000 people, the largest Coachella crowd to that point.[41] The festival began to develop worldwide interest and receive national renown.\nIn late December 2003, Van Santen died at the age of 41 from flu-related complications.[2] With Tollett left, he sold half of Coachella to AEG in 2004, along with the controlling interest in the festival.[9] The 2004 event featured a lineup of more than 80 acts,[42] with Radiohead and the Cure as headliners, along with a reunion of the Pixies. It was Coachella's first sellout, drawing a two-day total of 110,000 people. For the first time, the festival attracted attendees from all 50 US states.[22] The event was critically acclaimed; Hilburn called it \"the premier pop music festival in the country\", while Rolling Stone labeled it \"America's Best Music Festival\". Tollett said that 2004 was the turning point for Coachella, and he credited booking Radiohead with elevating the festival's stature and interest among musicians. However, he also described that year's event as a missed opportunity, as he passed on a chance to expand it to a third day that could have featured David Bowie as a headliner.[42]\nThe 2005 event ran from April 30 to May 1 and featured Coldplay and Nine Inch Nails as headliners, along with a reunion of Bauhaus. A planned reunion of Cocteau Twins was ultimately cancelled by the group.[43] Approximately 50,000 people attended each day of the festival.[44]\nDaft Punk's performance at Coachella 2006 is frequently cited as one of the most memorable in the festival's history.\nThe 2006 event featured headliners Depeche Mode and Tool. Two of the most popular performances were Madonna, who played in an overflowing dance tent, and Daft Punk, whose show featuring a pyramid-shaped stage is cited as one of the most memorable performances in Coachella history.[22] Around 120,000 concertgoers attended the event over two days,[22] garnering Goldenvoice a gross of $9 million.[45]\nIn 2007, Goldenvoice inaugurated the Stagecoach Festival, an annual country music festival that also takes place at the Empire Polo Club the weekend following Coachella. The new event helped avert complications with organizing Coachella; the polo club's owner Alex Haagen III had been planning to redevelop the land unless a new profitable event could be created to make a long-term lease with Goldenvoice financially feasible.[8] Along with the new festival's addition, Coachella was permanently extended to three days in 2007. The headlining acts were Red Hot Chili Peppers, the reunited Rage Against the Machine, and Bj\u00f6rk, all of whom headlined for the second time. The festival compiled a three-day aggregate attendance of over 186,000, a new best, and grossed $16.3 million.[46]\nIn 2008, Coachella did not sell out for the first time since 2003. It featured headliners Prince, Roger Waters, and Jack Johnson. Waters' inflatable prop pig flew away during his set.[22] The 2008 festival drew an attendance of 151,666 and grossed $13.8 million,[46] but lost money, due to tickets not selling out and high booking fees paid for Prince and Roger Waters.[8][24]\nThe 2009 festival occurred a week earlier than usual. The new dates were April 17, 18 and 19. The event featured headliners Paul McCartney, The Killers, and The Cure. On Friday, McCartney blew past the festival's strict curfew by 54 minutes.[22] Sunday, The Cure had their performance end abruptly, with the festival cutting stage power after passing their own curfew by 30 minutes.[47] Notable performances included Franz Ferdinand, M.I.A. (whose 2005 encore set in a tent was a first at the fest), Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and rare appearances from artists Leonard Cohen, Dr. Dog and Throbbing Gristle. The festival drew an aggregate attendance of 152,962 and grossed $15,328,863.[48]\nOrganizers eliminated single-day ticket sales for 2010, and instead instituted a new policy offering three-day tickets only,[49] which drew mixed reactions.[50] Headliners included Jay-Z, Muse and Gorillaz, and reunions of Faith No More and Pavement.[51] Despite Tollett's reservations about holding a festival in 2010 due to the economy,[52] Coachella drew 75,000 spectators each day that year, for an estimated aggregate attendance of 225,000, surpassing previous records.[53] Thousands of fans broke through fences, leading to concerns about overcrowding.[22] The festival grossed $21,703,500.[54] International travel was disrupted by the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland, resulting in some European acts, such as Frightened Rabbit, Gary Numan and Delphic, canceling their appearances at the festival.[55]\nPrior to the 2011 festival, Goldenvoice made several investments and improvements locally to help support Coachella. In addition to funding an additional lane for Avenue 50, which borders the festival, the promoter cleared additional space on the polo grounds by leveling a 250,000-square-foot area and moving horse stables.[56] Lighting and security were also enhanced to help the festival run more smoothly.[22] The headliners for that year's event were Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Kanye West, and The Strokes, along with another 190 supporting acts.[57] The 2011 festival grossed $24,993,698[58] from 75,000 paid attendees, for an aggregate attendance of 225,000 across the entire three-day weekend.[59]\nOn May 31, 2011, Goldenvoice announced that beginning with the 2012 festival, Coachella would be expanded to a second, separately-ticketed weekend, with identical lineups for each.[60] Explaining the decision, Tollett said that demand for tickets was up in 2011 even after \"operations weren't the best [they've] ever had\" in 2010 and that he did not want to satisfy that demand by allowing additional attendees to overcrowd the venue.[61]Rolling Stone called it a \"very risky move\" and said there was \"no guarantee that demand [would be] high enough to sell out the same bill over two consecutive weekends\".[60] Nonetheless, 2012 tickets sold out in less than three hours.[62]\nThe 2012 festival during sunset\nThe 2012 festival featured headliners the Black Keys, Radiohead, and a twin billing of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.[22] During the latter's performances, a projection of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur appeared on-stage [63][64] (a voice actor performed his introduction lines) and began performing \"Hail Mary\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\".[65] Although the media referred to the technology as a \"hologram\", the projection was in fact created using the Musion Eyeliner system, which employs a version of Pepper's ghost.[66][67] Following the performance, the projection disappeared. Dr. Dre had asked permission from Shakur's mother Afeni, who said the next day that she was thrilled with the performance.[68] A projection of deceased singer Nate Dogg was also planned, but Dr. Dre decided against it. The 2012 festival grossed $47,313,403 from 158,387 paid attendees across the two weekends; 80,726 tickets were sold for the first weekend, and 77,661 for the second.[69]\nCoachella grounds in 2013\nPrior to the 2013 festival, it was announced that Goldenvoice had reached a deal with the city of Indio to keep the Coachella and Stagecoach Festivals there through 2030. As part of the agreement, Indio's per-ticket share of revenue would increase from $2.33 per ticket to $5.01.[70] Headlining the 2013 festival were Blur, The Stone Roses, Phoenix, and Red Hot Chili Peppers.[71] General admission tickets sold for $349, a $34 increase from the previous year.[72] The festival grossed $67.2 million in ticket sales and was attended by 180,000 people, making it the top music festival in the world.[73] In July 2013, Goldenvoice finalized a $30 million purchase of 280 acres of land surrounding the Empire Polo Club, including the 200-acre Eldorado Polo Club. The land, previously leased from Eldorado, will be used to provide more space for parking and general use for the festival.[74] Tollett said the purchase was intended to \"help [Goldenvoice] put in some infrastructure so [they] don't have to keep coming back and do the same things each year\".[75]\nThe 2014 festival, held on April 11\u201313 and April 18\u201320, featured 184 artists.[76] A reunited Outkast headlined on Friday, Muse on Saturday, and Arcade Fire on Sunday.[77] General admission tickets sold out in less than 20 minutes, while all other tickets (including VIP tickets in excess of $5,000) sold out in less than 3 hours.[citation needed] That year's festival featured 96,500 daily attendees and grossed a record-breaking $78.332 million.[78][79] For the fourth consecutive year, Coachella was named the Top Festival at the Billboard Touring Awards.[79]\nA view of the ferris wheel from the polo grounds during Coachella 2015\nThe 2015 festival, held on April 10\u201312 and 17\u201319,[80] featured headliners AC/DC, Jack White, and Drake, with a surprise appearance by Madonna during the latter's weekend one performance. General admission tickets again sold out in less than 20 minutes.[citation needed] The event established new records for tickets sold (198,000) and total gross ($84,264,264) for a festival.[79] The festival won Pollstar's award for Major Music Festival of the Year,[81] marking the 10th time in 11 years that Coachella had won the award.[82]\nIn March 2016, the Indio City Council passed a measure to raise the attendance cap for Coachella from 99,000 to 125,000, stipulating that the capacity would gradually be increased, giving the city time to accommodate the crowds. Goldenvoice increased the venue size by about 50 acres along Monroe Street, Avenue 50, Avenue 52, and Polo Road.[83] The 2016 festival was held on April 15\u201317 and 22\u201324, and was headlined by a reunited LCD Soundsystem, a reunited Guns N' Roses (with original members Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff McKagan), and Calvin Harris. Ice Cube's appearance featured a reunion of N.W.A., while Guns N' Roses' first weekend performance featured a guest appearance from Angus Young of AC/DC, who headlined the previous year; the cameo occurred the same day that Rose was announced as the new singer for AC/DC. Weekend two was marked by several tributes to Prince, the 2008 headliner who died just prior to the weekend's shows. The festival sold 198,000 tickets and grossed $94.2 million.[84][85]\nIn January 2017, reports circulated that AEG owner Philip Anschutz had donated to many right-wing causes, including organizations promoting LGBTQ discrimination and climate change denial.[86] The news led to calls for fans to boycott the festival.[87] Anschutz decried the controversy as \"fake news\", saying he would never knowingly contribute to an anti-LGBTQ organization and would cease donations to any such group of which he became aware.[88]\nThe 2017 edition of Coachella took place from April 14\u201316 and April 21\u201323, and featured Radiohead, Lady Gaga, and Kendrick Lamar as headlining artists.[89] Beyonc\u00e9 was originally announced as a headliner but was forced to withdraw at the advice of her doctors after she became pregnant; she announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival.[90][91] Tickets sold out within a few hours of going on sale.[92] The event saw the debut of the new daytime-only Sonora tent.[93] The 2017 festival drew 250,000 attendees and grossed $114.6 million,[94] marking the first time a recurring festival grossed over $100 million.[95] Between the two weekends of Coachella, scenes for the film A Star Is Born, starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, were filmed on the festival grounds.[96]\nA report in Teen Vogue described \"rampant\" sexual harassment and assault at the 2018 festival, and the author said she was groped 22 times in 10 hours.[108] In response, Goldenvoice announced a new initiative in January 2019 called \"Every One\", which comprises \"fan resources and policies\" to combat sexual misconduct and improve the festival's responses to such behavior. \"Safety ambassadors\" were made available to direct attendees to professional counselors, and specially marked locations were added for attendees to seek services or report incidents of sexual misconduct. One of the program's goals stated, \"We are taking deliberate steps to develop a festival culture that is safe and inclusive for everyone\".[109]\nCoachella celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2019. Taking place from April 12\u201314 and 19\u201321, the festival was headlined by Childish Gambino, Tame Impala, and Ariana Grande.[110][111] At 25 years old, Grande became the youngest artist to headline the festival and just its fourth female headliner.[112] The festival was beset with several challenges. Justin Timberlake was reportedly slated to headline but had to cancel after bruising his vocal cords.[113] Goldenvoice was also forced to abandon plans for Kanye West to headline, as they could not accommodate his request to build a giant dome for his performance in the middle of the festival grounds. West was instead allowed to hold the first public \"Sunday Service\" performance on Easter on April 21 at the venue's campgrounds.[114] West and a gospel choir performed an approximately 33-song set list of his songs as well as classic R&B and gospel covers.[115] The first weekend of the festival suffered audio technical difficulties with several high-profile performances.[116] The following weekend, The Daily Beast published a report of the alleged \"inhumane treatment\" of the festival's security guards. The workers cited poor tent conditions, insufficient food and water, long hours in the harsh sun, minimum wages, and poor communication and coordination between the organizers and the subcontracting security firms.[117]\nCoachella returned in 2022 on April 15\u201317 and April 22\u201324.[123] The headlining lineup initially comprised Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, Kanye West, and Swedish House Mafia.[124] Less than two weeks before the festival, West withdrew. The vacancy in the Sunday night headliner slot was filled by Swedish House Mafia \u2013 who previously had not been scheduled for a specific day \u2013 for a joint performance with the Weeknd.[125] While not advertised as a headlining act, Arcade Fire was added to the official 2022 schedule on April 14, a day before the festival's first weekend.[126]\nThe 2023 edition of Coachella, which took place from April 14\u201316 and April 21\u201323, was also beset with last-minute lineup changes. The originally announced headliners were Bad Bunny, Blackpink, and Frank Ocean; the former two were Coachella's first Latin and Korean headliners, respectively.[127] In the days leading up to the first weekend, Ocean suffered leg injuries from an alleged bicycle accident on the festival grounds. The production for his performance was then scaled down extensively;[128] plans to utilize an ice rink with over 100 skaters were scrapped at the last minute,[129] forcing festival crew to hurriedly melt the ice surface.[130] Ocean began his performance an hour late, and after exceeding the festival curfew by 25 minutes, he abruptly ended his show.[131] He subsequently withdrew from the second weekend, citing recommendations from his doctor. Blink-182, which reunited its classic lineup and had been added to the festival two days before it began,[132] was promoted to fill the second weekend's headlining vacancy on Sunday night.[133] After they performed, the trio of DJs Skrillex, Four Tet, and Fred Again \u2013 all of whom were added to the lineup the day before the second weekend began \u2013 concluded the festival.[134] According to reports, Goldenvoice will incur more than $4 million in losses from the production costs associated with Ocean's unused ice rink, more than his booking fee for the performance. The promoters were also fined $133,000 for curfew violations from the opening weekend.[135]\nDuring the festival, several stages continuously host live music. Two outdoor stages are used, along with several tents named after deserts.[139] The primary stages that have been in use since Coachella's inception are:\nCoachella Stage \u2013 the main stage that draws the largest crowds. This outdoor stage is where the headlining acts perform.\nMojave \u2013 a mid-size tent[140] named after the Mojave Desert that hosts acts across multiple genres and varying stages of development.[139] In 2017, it was moved behind an access road. A year later, it received further changes, as it was enlarged and moved again, this time to the Sahara's previous spot near the rose garden.[140]\nGobi \u2013 a mid-size tent named after the Gobi Desert that hosts acts across multiple genres and varying stages of development.[139] Like the Mojave, it was moved behind an access road in 2017.[140]\nSahara \u2013 a large, hangar-like tent named after the Sahara Desert. It generally hosts the top electronic dance music acts.[139] In 2013, the tent was expanded in size, reaching a height of 80 feet. Further changes were made in 2018, as it was built 25 percent larger and relocated west from the row of tents near the Empire Polo Club's rose garden to a spot on the Eldorado Polo Club near the festival entrance. The new location offers more shade and alleviates issues with foot traffic.[140][141] The stage was also moved from one of the open ends of the structure to one its sides, allowing a wider field of view to attendees.[141]\nAdditional performance areas have been added over time, including:\nYuma \u2013 a small indoor tent introduced in 2013[142] that primarily hosts emerging DJs.[139] The tent was intended to be \"a sophisticated space that dials down the noise and strobe lights in favor of thoughtful sounds and underground acts\".[142]\nHeineken House \u2013 a small venue introduced in 2014. It was dedicated to \"legendary musical performances\" and \"live mash-ups from a wide array of musical artists\".[143] Originally designed as a walled structure to provide a club-like atmosphere, it was redesigned in 2019 to feature an open beer garden layout with a slanted roof, eliminating the long waiting lines and giving more visibility to attendees.[144]\nDespacio \u2013 a small indoor tent used in 2016. Co-created by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, the venue played \"slow-simmering disco and vintage club music\" on vinyl with the intention of creating a joyful setting. It featured a 50,000 watt sound system and air conditioning.[145][146]\nAntarctic \u2013 an indoor dome introduced in 2017 to screen 360-degree immersive videos. The structure is 120 feet in diameter, features 11,000 square feet in projection space and air conditioning, and can seat 500 people. Obscura Digital produced the film shown in 2017.[139][147]\nTwo art installations from Coachella 2014: Lightweaver and Escape Velocity. The latter piece was one of several giant moving art installations designed by Poetic Kinetics for past Coachella festivals.\nIn addition to hosting live music, Coachella is a showcase for visual arts, including installation art and sculpture. Many of the pieces are interactive, providing a visual treat for attendees.[148] Throughout the years, the art has grown in scale and outrageousness.[149] Paul Clemente, Coachella's art director since 2009,[150] said, \"I think the level of detail and finish and artistry and scale and complexity and technology, everything is constantly getting notched up, ratcheted up. We're obviously constantly trying to, for lack of a better word, (to) outdo ourselves and make it better for the fans.\"[149]\nIn Coachella's early years, art was mostly recycled from the previous year's Burning Man festival, due to smaller budgets.[150] Between 2010 and 2015, Goldenvoice shifted its focus from renting pieces to commissioning them specifically for the festival, increasing their budget. Artists are given access to the grounds just 10 days before the festival, giving them a tight timeframe in which to assemble their pieces.[149] Due to the high cost of re-assembly, only about half of them appear again outside of Coachella.[148] Describing the festival's importance to art, Cynthia Washburn of art collective Poetic Kinetics said, \"With all the exposure here, I think Coachella is becoming as attractive for artists as it is for the musicians.\"[151] In 2013, Clemente considered about 300 art proposals, the most in the festival's history for the time.[151] Poetic Kinetics has designed several giant moving art installations for past Coachella festivals, including a snail in 2013 (\"Helix Poeticus\"), an astronaut in 2014 (\"Escape Velocity\"), and a caterpillar that \"metamorphosized\" into a butterfly in 2015 (\"Papilio Merraculous\").[152] The collective reprised the astronaut for the 2019 festival (\"Overview Effect\"), with weathering affects applied to the design.[153]\nAs the host city to Coachella and the Stagecoach Festival, Indio provides several services such as police and fire protection, private security, medical services, outside law enforcement, and city staff services. These services for the three weekends of festivals totaled $2.77 million in 2012.[154] All public safety needs are coordinated by Indio's police department, requiring them to liaise with nearly 12 agencies, including police departments from nearby cities, the sheriff's department, California Highway Patrol, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, American Medical Response, and the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.[154] To avoid disturbing local residents, a curfew for music performances is enforced; since 2010, it has been 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, an hour later than the previous curfew,[154] and midnight on Sunday nights.[82] Per a 2013 agreement with the City of Indio, Goldenvoice must pay a fine of $20,000 if it exceeds the curfew by five minutes, plus $1,000 for each additional minute beyond that. The fines benefit the city's General Fund, which covers operating costs, public work services, and the police and fire departments.[155]\nCoachella features Global Inheritance's TRASHed :: Art of Recycling campaign, in which artists from across the US design recycling bins.\nOrganizers of Coachella manage its carbon footprint by partnering with the organization Global Inheritance to promote several environmentally friendly initiatives. Global Inheritance's original project was its \"TRASHed :: Art of Recycling\" campaign, which challenges local artists to design and decorate recycling bins that are placed across the festival grounds.[156] Another program is \"Carpoolchella\"; launched in 2007,[156] it rewards festivalgoers who carpool in groups of four or more and display the word \"Carpoolchella\" on their cars by entering them in a drawing to win VIP tickets for life.[157] Through the 2014 festival, the program had 140,000 participants and more than 70 winners of lifetime festival passes.[158] In 2007, Coachella teamed up with Global Inheritance to start a 10-for-1 recycling program, in which anyone who collects ten empty water bottles receives a free full one. In 2009, the festival introduced $10 refillable water bottles, which purchasers could refill at water stations inside the festival and within the campgrounds.[159] Other programs used at the festival include solar powered DJ booths and seesaws used to charge mobile phones.[156]\nAbout 600 staffers are required to collect the litter that accumulates during the festival. Resources are sorted individually on site before being taken to local landfills and recycling centers. Goldenvoice maintains a goal to \"divert 90 percent of [its] recyclable and compostable materials\". In 2013, staff diverted over 577,720,000 pounds of materials, comprising 36,860 tons of aluminum cans, 105,000 tons of cardboard, 65,360 tons of PET plastic, 47,040 tons of scrap metal, and 34,600 tons of glass.[160]\nIn 2003, Coachella began allowing tent camping as an option for festival lodging. The campground site is on a polo field adjacent to the venue grounds and has its own entrance on the south side of the venue. 2010 introduced many new features, such as re-entry from the campsite to the festival grounds, parking next to your tent, and recreational vehicle camping spots (recreational vehicle camping was offered one year only). For that festival, there were more than 17,000 campers. At the 2012 event, on-site facilities included recycling, a general store, showers, mobile phone charging stations and an internet cafe with free WiFi.[161]\nTollett begins to book artists for each festival as early as the previous August. In addition to agent pitches and artists discovered online, the lineup is culled from acts booked by Goldenvoice for their other 1,800 shows each year. Tollett uses the promoter's ticketing figures for insight into whom to book, saying: \"There are AEG shows all across the country, and I see all their show lists and ticket counts. So I see little things that are happening maybe before some others, because they don't have that data.\"[162] The booking process takes approximately six months.[9]\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, booking fees for most artists playing the festival allegedly start at $15,000 and extend into the \"high six figures.\" Top-billed artists for 2010 were expected to receive over $1 million.[163]Billboard's sources estimated that non-headline acts can earn anywhere from $500 to $100,000.[162] According to a 2017 profile on Tollett in The New Yorker, that year's headlining performers received $3\u20134 million.[9] Beyonc\u00e9's 2018 performances and Ariana Grande's 2019 performances reportedly garnered them each $8 million.[164]\nIn booking the festival, Goldenvoice uses radius clauses that can prevent acts from performing in the vicinity of Coachella for a certain amount of time before and after the festival. The promoter has allowed some of Coachella's acts to make appearances in the region prior to the festival and between weekends, but only at events and venues owned or controlled by Goldenvoice's parent company AEG; one such example was Jay-Z's concert at Staples Center in 2010.[163][165][166] Goldenvoice now promotes these events, dubbed \"Localchella\", as a series of small warm-up shows for Coachella in Southern California.[167][168] In May 2018, AEG and its subsidiaries were sued by the Oregon-based Soul'D Out Festival for anti-competitive practices related to Coachella's radius clause. As part of the lawsuit, the clause's details were revealed. They stipulate that any artist performing at Coachella:[169][170]\nCannot perform at any other North American festival from December 15 to May 1.\nCannot play any hard ticket shows in Southern California from December 15 to May 1.\nCannot \"advertise, publicize or leak\" performances for competing festivals in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, or Arizona, or headlining performances in Southern California taking place after May 1 until after May 7.\nCannot publicize concerts in California, Arizona, Washington, or Oregon until after the January announcement of Coachella's lineup, except for performances in Las Vegas casinos.\nGoldenvoice attempts to release the lineup poster as close to New Year's Day as possible, so that Coachella is the first major festival of the year to announce its lineup. This gives the promoter a competitive advantage over other festivals, many of which end up sharing headliners by the time they are all announced.[9] The Coachella lineup poster lists its music artists across several lines in gradually decreasing font sizes in descending order of prominence. The line on which an artist's name appears as well as their font size is a contentious topic between Goldenvoice and talent agents, as placement on the poster will often dictate an artist's future booking fee. Tollett said, \"We have so many arguments over font sizes. I literally have gone to the mat over one point size.\"[9]\nOrganizers were initially resistant to accepting sponsorship deals that would help Coachella turn a higher profit. In 2003, Tollett estimated that Goldenvoice could earn an additional $300,000 to $500,000 by adding a corporate sponsor to the festival name, but he did not want to violate the purity of the event. He said, \"I hate it when you go to shows and you are bombarded with all this advertising. It just shows a lack of respect for your audience and the music.\"[23] Organizers have relaxed their opposition over the years. Brewing company Heineken N.V. has maintained a sponsorship with Coachella since 2002, and is the \"official brew\" of the festival.[171] The company has sponsored a small performance venue at the festival called the \"Heineken House\" since 2014, where attendees can drink Heineken beers and keep their cases of Heineken refrigerated.[143] Clothing retailer H&M added a small sponsored tent on the festival grounds in 2015,[172] where attendees could purchase items from the company's Coachella-inspired clothing line called \"H&M Loves Coachella\".[173] Information technology company HP has sponsored the Antarctic dome since 2017,[147] in addition to hosting a promotional tent.[174] HP's promotions included allowing attendees to design and print bandanas and tote bags, capture light drawingGIFs, design kaleidoscopes, and interact with a motion-reactive wall.[147][174] Tollett still objects to having the primary stages and tents sponsored: \"I wouldn't let sponsors' logos on the stages. I feel like when the band is playing it should be you and the band, and it's a sacred moment.\"[9]\nSince 2011, YouTube has live streamed performances from Coachella.[175] Initially, the first weekend was streamed across three separate channels.[137][176] In 2014, AXS TV began broadcasting the second weekend on television;[177] over 20 hours of live performances from the 2015 festival were broadcast on AXS TV.[178] Performances from the 2015 festival were also broadcast live on Sirius XM satellite radio for the first time.[179] In 2019, YouTube expanded its content for the festival livestream, which included a stream of both weekends of the festival for the first time. Weekend one included a premiere of Donald Glover's film Guava Island, while weekend two featured Coachella Curated, programming hosted by radio personality Jason Bentley that took \"a deep dive into the festival experience\" by offering \"encore and live performances, artist commentary, mini-docs, animated adventures and more\".[180]Coachella Curated was reprised for the 2022 festival's second weekend.[181] In 2023, Coachella's streaming agreement with YouTube was renewed through 2026,[175] and for the first time, performances from all six stages were streamed, covering both weekends.[182]\nFor 2016, organizers partnered with Vantage.tv to offer virtual reality (VR) content for the festival. Ticket holders received a cardboard VR viewer inspired by Google Cardboard in their Coachella welcome package that could be used with the Coachella VR mobile app (which was released on Android, iOS, and Samsung Gear VR). Content included 360-degree panoramic photos of previous events, virtual tours of the 2016 festival site, interviews, and performances.[183] That same year, YouTube live streamed performances from weekend two in 360 degrees for viewing with VR headsets.[184]\nThe success of Coachella has led its organizers to partner with other American music festivals. In 2003, Goldenvoice agreed to work with the organizers of Field Day, a New York-based festival modeled after Coachella, to help promote and produce the event,[185] although the show was completely overhauled from its original vision.[186] In September 2014, Goldenvoice announced it had entered into a joint venture with Red Frog Events to help them promote and produce their Firefly Music Festival.[187] In January 2015, a similar agreement was reached with the organizers of the Hangout Music Festival.[188]\nGoldenvoice claimed it spent $700,000 in 2015 on \"media and related content to promote Coachella\".[189]\nGoldenvoice has actively protected the Coachella brand. As of April 2018, they filed six lawsuits in the previous two years against outlets that attempted to use the Coachella name or the suffix \"chella\". The defendants included the music festival Hoodchella; the film festival Filmchella; energy company Phillips 66, which promoted a Coachella wristband giveaway that the festival's terms of services disallows; Sean Combs's event \"Combschella\"; Urban Outfitters; and a Whole Foods location in Palm Desert that promoted a \"Wholechella\" concert and tasting event. Another lawsuit was filed in September 2021 against radio presenter RaaShaun Casey (also known as DJ Envy) for his hip hop and auto show \"Carchella\", which he agreed to rename to \"DJ Envy's Drive Your Dreams Car Show\".[190][191] According to Goldenvoice's attorneys in one lawsuit, the litigation is one way the promoter attempts to \"extensively police unauthorized use of the Coachella Marks\". Although the Coachella name has been in use by a town in the Coachella Valley since before the festival was founded, the festival's success has imbued the name with \"secondary meaning\", allowing Goldenvoice to trademark it.[170]\nIn December 2021, Coachella won a restraining order against Live Nation's Coachella Day One 22 festival. A judge ruled that Live Nation is likely infringing trademarks by selling tickets to the event nearby.[192]\nAccording to a 2015 ranking by online ticket retailer Viagogo, Coachella was the second-most in-demand concert ticket, trailing only the Tomorrowland festival.[193]\nCoachella is considered a trendsetter in music and fashion. Singer Katy Perry said, \"The lineup always introduces the best of the year for the rest of the year.\"[162]\nCoachella has become known for the variety of distinctive apparel worn by attendees, which primarily include eclectic combinations of colors, materials, and ethnic borrowings.[194] The latter has also resulted in backlash regarding cultural appropriation, particularly for non-natives wearing Native American-inspired headdresses and body paint.[195][196][197]\nAccording to a 2012 economic impact study, Coachella brought $254.4 million to the desert region that year;[198] of that total, Indio received $89.2 million in consumer spending and $1.4 million in tax revenue.[193] Goldenvoice's other festival at the Empire Polo Club, Stagecoach, has been called a \"cousin\" of Coachella, but it has grown at a faster pace, eventually selling out for the first time in 2012 with 55,000 attendees.[199] Together, the two festivals were estimated by experts to have a global impact of $704.75 million in 2016;[200] approximately $403.2 million of that was expected to impact the Coachella Valley,[200] $106 million of which would go to businesses in Indio.[201] The city was expected to gain $3.18 million in ticket taxes from the two festivals in 2016.[201]\nThe success of Coachella led to Goldenvoice holding additional music festivals at the Empire Polo Club. It founded the country music festival Stagecoach in 2007 and continues to hold it on an annual basis. In 2011, the promoter staged the Big 4 festival, so-named for its quadruple billing of the most prominent bands in thrash metal\u2014Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer.[202] In 2016, Goldenvoice staged Desert Trip, which featured older rock oriented and legacy acts such as the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, and Bob Dylan.[203]\n^No award ceremony was held in 2017.

        "context": "\nBlack Friday is a colloquial term for the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States. It traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season in the United States. Many stores\noffer highly promoted sales at discounted prices and often open early, sometimes as early as midnight[2] or even on Thanksgiving. Some stores' sales continue to Monday (\"Cyber Monday\") or for a week (\"Cyber Week\").\nBlack Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States.[3][4][5]\nFor centuries, the adjective \"black\" has been applied to days upon which calamities occurred. Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American history was the Panic of 1869, which occurred when financiers Jay Gould and James Fisk took advantage of their connections with the Grant Administration in an attempt to corner the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by 18%. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, was ruined.\nThe earliest known use of \"Black Friday\" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, Factory Management and Maintenance, for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day week-end. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms \"Black Friday\" and \"Black Saturday\" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and Rochester to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days \"Big Friday\" and \"Big Saturday,\u201d but these terms were quickly forgotten.[6][7][8][9][10][11]\nThe use of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in The New York Times on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to \"the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year\" in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.[12]\nAs the phrase gained national attention in the early 1980s, merchants objecting to the use of a derisive term to refer to one of the most important shopping days of the year suggested an alternative derivation: that retailers traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season, beginning on the day after Thanksgiving.[6] When this was recorded in the financial records, once-common accounting practices would use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink to show positive amounts. Black Friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer be \"in the red,\u201d instead of taking in the year's profits.[6][12][13] The earliest known published reference to this explanation occurs in The Philadelphia Inquirer for November 28, 1981.[14]\nSince the early 21st century, there have been attempts by U.S.-based retailers to introduce a retail \"Black Friday\" to other countries around the world. Retailers outside the US have attempted to promote the day to remain competitive with US-based online retailers.[15]\nIn more recent decades, global retailers have adopted the term and date to market their own holiday sales.[16]\nThe day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the beginning of the United States Christmas shopping season since 1952. The practice may be linked with the idea of Santa Claus parades. Parades celebrating Thanksgiving often include an appearance by Santa at the end of the parade, with the idea that \"Santa has arrived\" or \"Santa is just around the corner\" because Christmas is always the next major Christian holiday following Thanksgiving.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Santa or Thanksgiving parades were sponsored by department stores. These include the continuing Toronto Santa Claus Parade in Canada since 1905, originally sponsored by Eaton's, and Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade held in Manhattan, New York City since 1924, sponsored by Macy's. Department stores would use the parades to launch a big advertising push. Eventually, it became an unwritten rule that no store would try doing Christmas advertising before the parade was over. Therefore, the day after Thanksgiving became the day when the shopping season officially started.\nThanksgiving's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.[17] Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving on the traditional date.[17] Some started referring to the new date as Franksgiving.\nIn 2015, Amazon.com was the first to offer \"Black Friday in July\" deals on what they called \"Prime Day\", promising better deals than on Black Friday. Amazon repeated the practice in 2016 and 2017, and other companies began offering similar deals.[18]\nAnalyst Marshal Cohen of The NPD Group claimed in 2020 that Black Friday is declining in favor of online shopping,[19] and that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process. The pandemic also resulted in holiday deals being offered over a longer period of time, even as early as October.[20] Fewer people shopped in person on Black Friday 2020, and most business took place online. Market research company Numerator said sellers of clothing, tools and other items considered nonessential during lockdowns were not promoted as heavily because lower production meant less available to sell.[21]Adobe Analytics reported that online sales reached $9 billion in 2020, 22% more than the previous year. Foot traffic to stores fell 48% in 2020 from last year, according to RetailNext, while Sensormatic Solutions reported a 52% decrease.[22]\nFor many years, retailers pushed opening times on Black Friday earlier and earlier, eventually reaching midnight, before opening on the evening of Thanksgiving. In 2009, Kmart manager Freddy Moss opened at 7 P.M. on Thanksgiving in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families. Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8 P.M. or 9 P.M., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\". In subsequent years, other stores have followed this trend, opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving, or remaining open all day, beginning in the early morning hours.[23][24] Some retail and media sources have used the terms \"Gray Thursday\" or \"Brown Thursday\" instead.[25][26][27]\nThe 2014 \"Black Thursday\" sales were generally a failure, as overall sales for the holiday week-end fell 11% compared to the previous year despite heavy traffic at the stores on Thanksgiving night.[28] In response, a number of retailers decided to go back to closing on Thanksgiving for 2015, and Walmart, although its holding firm opening on the holiday and holding its sale, also pledged to offer the same deals online for those who wished to stay home.[29]\nRetailers have received pushback from some consumers over opening on Thanksgiving Day.[30] Shopper opposition to stores opening on Thursday includes the perceived over-commercialization of Thanksgiving, retail workers not being able to spend time with their loved ones on the holiday,[31] and Thursday doorbuster sales forcing consumers to sacrifice enjoying Thanksgiving evening with their families in order to avoid missing out on highly sought-after items which might not be available again prior to Christmas.\nMost retailers abandoned efforts to hold doorbuster sales on Thanksgiving in 2020; large crowds had been forbidden under most circumstances since March due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, major retailers such as Walmart and Target had already reduced their hours and dropped 24/7 operations in response to the pandemic, and several retailers known for opening on the holiday (particularly Kmart, which has typically been open regular hours) have rapidly declined.[32] According to Adobe Analytics, online shopping set a record on Thanksgiving 2020 with $5.1 billion in total spending, 21.5% higher than in 2019.[21] Most major retailers again closed on Thanksgiving in 2021, with Target stating that its decision would be permanent; the small minority of retail chains remaining open on the holiday that year were limited mainly to pharmacies, dollar stores and grocery stores, retail categories that traditionally do not hold doorbusters.[33]\nBlack Friday is not an official holiday in the United States, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for state government employees. It is sometimes observed in lieu of another federal holiday, such as Columbus Day. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off. Along with the following regular week-end, this makes Black Friday weekend a four-day weekend, which is said to increase the number of potential shoppers.\nBlack Friday is a shopping day for a combination of reasons. As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday week-end. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of \"doorbuster\" items to entice traffic.\nFor many years, it was common for retailers to open at 6a.m., but in the late 2000s many opened at 4a.m.\u20135a.m. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. In 2010, Toys 'R' Us began their Black Friday sales at 10p.m. on Thanksgiving and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of Crayola crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like Sears, Express, MK, Victoria's Secret, Zumiez, Tillys, American Eagle Outfitters, Nike, Jordan, Puma, A\u00e9ropostale, and Kmart, began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11p.m. Friday evening. Forever 21 went in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday, and running late sales until 2a.m. Saturday morning.[36][37] In 2011, when several retailers (including Target, Kohl's, Macy's, Best Buy, and Bealls)[2] opened at midnight for the first time.[38] In 2012, Walmart and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 8p.m. on Thanksgiving, prompting calls for a walkout among some workers.[39] In 2014, stores such as JCPenney, Best Buy, and Radio Shack opened at 6a.m. on Thanksgiving while stores such as Target, Walmart, Belk, and Sears opened at 7p.m. on Thanksgiving.[40][41] Three states \u2013 Rhode Island, Maine, and Massachusetts \u2013 prohibit large supermarkets, big box stores, and department stores from opening on Thanksgiving, in what has been referred to as a legacy of blue laws.[42][43] A bill to allow stores to open on Thanksgiving was the subject of a public hearing on July 8, 2017.[44]\nHistorically, it was common for Black Friday sales to extend throughout the following week-end. However, this practice has largely disappeared in recent years, perhaps because of an effort by retailers to create a greater sense of urgency.\nThe news media usually give heavy play to reports of Black Friday shopping and their implications for the commercial success of the Christmas shopping season, but the relationship between Black Friday sales and retail sales for the full holiday season is quite weak and may even be negative.[45]\nIn 2014, spending volume on Black Friday fell for the first time since the 2008 recession. 50.9 billion dollars was spent during the four-day Black Friday week-end, down 11% from the previous year. However, the U.S. economy was not in a recession. Christmas creep has been cited as a factor in the diminishing importance of Black Friday, as many retailers now spread out their promotions over the entire months of November and December rather than concentrate them on a single shopping day or week-end.[46]\nIn 2015, Neil Stern of McMillan Doolittle said, \"Black Friday is quickly losing its meaning on many fronts,\" because many stores opened on Thanksgiving, and a lot of sales started even earlier than that. Online shopping also made the day less important.[49] A Gallup poll in 2012 has shown that only 18% of American adults planned to shop during Black Friday.[50]\nIn 2020, an article in Ad Age magazine stated that \"an American capitalist tradition ... has been on the wane for years as online shopping rises in popularity\" but the COVID-19 pandemic, \"which has dramatically altered shopping patterns, has seemingly dealt a fatal blow.\"[51]\nBy 2021, spending during the holiday season was expected to continue to increase, but Black Friday was no longer a single day. It was instead an opportunity for retailers to offer deals during the season as online shopping continued to change consumer behavior. COVID-19 had increased the changes in buyer and retailer moves toward online transactions. Supply chain disruptions caused consumers to buy earlier when they could find items.[52]\nThe large population centers on Lake Ontario and the Lower Mainland in Canada have always attracted cross-border shopping into the United States, and as Black Friday became more popular in the U.S., Canadians often flocked over the border because of their lower prices and a stronger Canadian dollar. After 2001, many were traveling for the deals across the border. Starting in 2008 and 2009, due to the parity of the Canadian dollar compared with the American dollar, several major Canadian retailers ran Black Friday deals of their own to discourage shoppers from leaving Canada.[53][54]\nThe year 2012 saw the biggest Black Friday to date in Canada, as Canadian retailers embraced it in an attempt to keep shoppers from travelling across the border.[55]\nBefore the advent of Black Friday in Canada, the most comparable holiday was Boxing Day in terms of retailer impact and consumerism. Black Fridays in the U.S. seem to provide deeper or more extreme price cuts than Canadian retailers, even for the same international retailer.\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"Black Friday\" originated within the Police and NHS to refer to the Friday before Christmas. It is the day when emergency services activate contingency plans to cope with the increase in workload due to many people going out drinking on the last Friday before Christmas. Contingencies can include setting up mobile field hospitals near City Centre nightspots.[56] The term has then been adopted outside those services to refer to the evening and night of the Friday immediately before Christmas, and would now be considered a mainstream term and not simply as jargon of the emergency services.\nTraditionally, Boxing Day had been considered the biggest shopping day of the year in the UK. In the 2010s, several American-owned retailers such as Amazon UK and the Walmart-owned chain Asda, began to hold U.S.-style Black Friday promotions; in 2014, more British retailers began to adopt the concept, including Argos, John Lewis, and Very. That year, police forces were called to shops across Britain to deal with crowd control issues, assaults, threatening customers, and traffic issues.[57][58] In response to incidents at branches of Tesco, Greater Manchester Police's deputy chief constable Ian Hopkins said shoppers had behaved in an \"appalling\" fashion, and criticized shops for not making adequate security arrangements to ensure the safety of customers.\"[59] Following these incidents, some retailers began to discontinue or heavily modify their promotions, with Asda stating that it would not hold all of its sales across a single day.[60][61][62]\nIn 2016, total spending on online retail sites on Black Friday was \u00a31.23 billion, a 2.2% year-over-year increase over 2015.[63][64] In 2017, UK retail sales in November grew faster than in December for the first time.[65][66]\nIn Mexico, Black Friday was the inspiration for the government and retailing industry to create an annual week-end of discounts and extended credit terms, El Buen Fin, meaning \"the good weekend\" in Spanish.[68] El Buen Fin has been in existence since 2011 and takes place on November in the week-end prior to the Monday in which the Mexican Revolution holiday is pushed from its original date of November 20, as a result of the measure taken by the government of pushing certain holidays to the Monday of their week in order to avoid the workers and students to make a \"larger\" week-end (for example, not attending in a Friday after a Thursday holiday, thus making a four-day week-end). On this week-end, major retailers extend their store hours[69] and offer special promotions, including extended credit terms and price promotions.\nThe concept was imported in Romania by eMAG [ro] and Flanco in 2011 and became bigger each year. The two reported the biggest Black Friday sales in 2014. eMAG sold products worth some 37 million euros while Flanco's sales totaled 22 million euros. Hundreds of retailers announced their participation in the 2015 campaign.[70]\nIn 2015, 11 million Romanians say they have heard about Black Friday which is 73% of the 15 million people target segment. 6.7 million plan on buying something on biggest shopping event of the year in Romania.[71]\nThe holiday shopping season in India has traditionally been aligned around the \"festive period\" of major festivals usually falling around October, such as Diwali.[72][73][74] Seeking to emulate U.S.-style shopping events such as Black Friday, online retailers adopted the practice of holding multi-day promotions during this period, such as Amazon's \"Great Indian Festival\" and Flipkart's \"Big Billion Days\". India's Independence Day (15 August) had also recently attracted similar events.[74][75]\nNonetheless, the concept of Black Friday has also been imported into the subcontinent via international retailers\u2013a move that influenced some Indian retailers to also adopt the promotion.[74][76]\nFrench businesses are slowly introducing the Black Friday custom into the market.[77] Discounts of up to 85% were given by retailing giants such as Apple and Amazon in 2014.[78] French electronics retailers such as FNAC and Auchan advertised deals online, while Darty also took part in this once-a-year monster sale. Retailers favored the very American term \"Black Friday\" to \"Vendredi noir\" in their advertisements.[79] In 2016, because of the terror attacks in Paris in November the year before, some retailers used the name \"Jour XXL\" (XXL day) instead of Black Friday.[80] An alternative was brought up by some online businesses in 2018, called \"French Days\",[81] which goal is to replicate Black Friday during spring season (starting around the first day of May).\nOn November 20, 2020, the French government finalized an agreement with e-commerce businesses like Amazon and supermarket chains to postpone Black Friday promotions by a week. Discounted shopping promotions were to begin on December 4 instead, after physical stores shuttered during the COVID-19 pandemic were allowed to reopen.[82]\nIn Germany, \"Black Friday\" retailer advertisements refer to \"Black Week\" and \"Black Shopping\" in English with sales lasting an entire week (excluding Sundays when most retail stores are closed). During this sales period, stores keep their normal working hours. Although goods are offered at reduced prices, the prices are not cut significantly more than normal weekly price reductions. Apple was the first company to run a special Black Friday campaign for the German market in 2006.[83] Apple never used the name Black Friday in Germany, but promotes only a \"one-day shopping event\".[84] In the first years, mostly internet retailers have used the event as an occasion to attract new customers with discounts, but bricks and mortar stores have already begun to adapt the shopping event. For the first time ever, German customers spent more than \u20ac1 billion during the Black Friday week-end in 2016: According to a Centre for Retail Research study, German customers spend around \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.54 billion) during the four days from Black Friday to Cyber Monday 2016.[85]\nIn Germany the term \"Black Friday\" was registered as a wordmark in December 2013. The owner is Super Union Holdings Limited, a Chinese company.[86] The trademark rights were largely revoked by the German Federal Patent Court and the German Federal Court of Justice. The trademark protection has thus essentially lapsed.[87]\nIn 2015, Swiss retailer Manor was the first to launch a special Black Friday promotion. The year after, most Swiss retailers launched special offers during the Black Friday Week. It is estimated that customers spent around 400 million Swiss Francs on Black Friday 2018. In recent years, Singles Day got more and more important in Switzerland. This shopping day could replace Black Friday as the most important shopping day in Switzerland in 2019[88]\nIn Australia, the term is controversial,[89][90] as prior to its popularisation as a shopping day, it referred not to shopping at all, but to the devastating Black Friday bushfires that occurred in Victoria 1938\u201339.[89][90][91][92] It was not until the 2010s that it was heavily promoted as a shopping day in Australia by in-store and online retailers, despite backlash and confusion by consumers. In 2011, Online Shopping USA hosted an event on Twitter. Twitter users had to use the hashtag #osublackfriday, which allowed them to follow along and tweet their favourite deals and discounts from stores.[93] In 2013, Apple extended its Black Friday deals to Australia. Purchasing online gave customers free shipping and free iTunes gift cards with every purchase. The deals were promoted on its website, reading \"Official Apple Store \u2013 One day Apple shopping event Friday, November 29\".[94]Australia Post's ShopMate parcel-forwarding service allows Australian customers to purchase products with \"Black Friday\" deals from the US and get them shipped to Australia. ShopMate ran from 2014-2022. It closed in February 2022 amid controversy about shipping costs. [95]\nIn addition to this service, numerous stores in the country run Black Friday promotions in-store and online throughout the country.[96]\nIn Norway, Black Friday started as a publicity stunt campaign back in 2010 to increase the sales to the shopping mall Norwegian Outlet. Since the introduction, it has been promoted every year in a larger and growing market all over the country.[99]\nBlack Friday is known as Viernes Negro in Costa Rica.[100] In Panama, Black Friday was first celebrated in 2012, as a move from the Government to attract local tourism to the country's capital city. During its first year, it was believed to have attracted an inflow of about 35,000 regional tourists according to the government's immigration census.\nIn Liechtenstein and Switzerland, Black Friday Sale is a joint sales initiative by hundreds of online vendors. Over its first 24-hour run on November 28, 2013, more than 1.2 million people visited the site, making it the single largest online shopping event in German-speaking countries. There has been growing interest for Black Friday in Poland as well.\nFor the Middle East, U.A.E. Black Friday started as White Friday campaign in 2014. In 2018 local e-commerce platform noon.com created Yellow Friday in the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia. The Yellow Friday Sale is now an annual event in Saudi Arabia, Iran and the U.A.E., falling around the same time as Black Friday globally.\nIn 2015, Spain joined with some small retailers. The celebration became more famous year by year, until the big retailers grew.\nIn the Netherlands, Black Friday was seriously introduced in 2015. Some years before, there were already a number of large and small retailers that used Black Friday in their marketing. However, with a total of 35 participating stores, 2015 can be considered the year in which Black Friday started in the Netherlands due to a more widespread support of large retailers. The popularity of Black Friday has grown rapidly in the Netherlands. The number of participating stores has increased to over 125 during the Black Friday period of 2017. For the 2018 edition, 166 shops joined the largest black Friday platform in the Netherlands.\nBlack Friday in Belgium is seriously marketed by retailers since 2016. Especially online shops have broke sales records during the last edition of Black Friday, which provides a base for further growth of popularity of Black Friday in Belgium. After 2016, Black Friday in Belgium has grown strongly. The participating shops have increased to over seventy during the Black Friday period of 2017. During Black Friday 2018, a total of 119 participating stores were measured in Belgium.\nIn 2017, Black Friday became widely popular in Latvia. There was even a Black week and Black week-end sales in shopping centres.\nBlack Friday has been increasingly adopted by stores in Brazil since 2010,[106] although not without its share of inflated prices and other scams, especially in its earlier years, earning the nickname \"Black Fraude\"[107] (Black Fraud) or also \"Black Furadei\", which comes from the slang word \"furada\", meaning a \"jam\" or tough situation, usually involving money. It is also common to hear Brazilian people say that prices on Brazilian Black Friday are \"half of the double\". However, currently, the term \"Black Friday\" has become so popular in the country that stores have been under closer scrutiny from consumers and cases of known scams have been reduced greatly[citation needed].\nDespite frequent attempts to control the crowds of shoppers, minor injuries are common among the crowds, usually as a result of being pushed or thrown to the ground in small stampedes. While most injuries remain minor, serious injuries and even deliberate violence have taken place on some Black Fridays.\nIn 2008, a crowd of approximately 2,000 shoppers in Valley Stream, New York, waited outside for the 05:00 opening of the local Walmart. As opening time approached, the crowd grew anxious and when the doors were opened, the crowd pushed forward, breaking the door down, and 34-year-old employee Jdimytai Damour was trampled to death. The shoppers did not appear concerned with the victim's fate, expressing refusal to halt their stampede when other employees attempted to intervene and help the injured employee, complaining that they had been waiting in the cold and were not willing to wait any longer. Shoppers had begun assembling as early as 21:00 the evening before. Even when police arrived and attempted to render aid to the injured man, shoppers continued to pour in, shoving and pushing the officers as they made their way into the store. Several other people incurred minor injuries, including a pregnant woman who had to be taken to the hospital.[108][109][110] The incident may be the first case of a death occurring during Black Friday sales; according to the National Retail Federation, \"We are not aware of any other circumstances where a retail employee has died working on the day after Thanksgiving.\"[108]\nOn the same day, two people were fatally shot during an altercation at a Toys 'R' Us in Palm Desert, California.[111]\nA man was arrested at a Florida Wal-Mart on drug and weapons charges after other shoppers waiting in line for the store to open noticed he was carrying a handgun and reported it to the police. He was discovered to also be carrying two knives and a pepper spray grenade.[115] A man in Buffalo, New York, was trampled when doors opened at a Target store and unruly shoppers rushed in, in an episode reminiscent of the deadly 2008 Wal-Mart stampede.[116]\nOn Black Friday 2011, a woman at a Porter Ranch, CaliforniaWalmart used pepper spray on fellow shoppers, causing minor injuries to a reported 20 people who had been waiting hours for the store to open. The incident started as people waited in line for the newly discounted Xbox 360. A witness said a woman with two children in tow became upset with the way people were pushing in line. The witness said she pulled out pepper spray and sprayed the other people in line. Another account stated: \"The store had brought out a crate of discounted Xbox 360s, and a crowd had formed to wait for the unwrapping, when the woman began spraying people 'in order to get an advantage,' according to the police.[117] In an incident outside a Walmart store in San Leandro, California, one man was wounded after being shot following Black Friday shopping at about 1:45 a.m.[118] A 61-year-old pharmacist collapsed and was left for dead by shoppers while being trampled and passed by a stampede. He died soon after from his injuries.[119]\nOn Black Friday in 2013, a person in Las Vegas who was carrying a big-screen TV home from a Target store on Thanksgiving was shot in the leg as he tried to wrestle the item back from a robber who had just stolen it from him at gunpoint.[121] In Romeoville, Illinois, a police officer shot a suspected shoplifter driving a car that was dragging a fellow officer at a Kohl's department store. The suspect and the dragged officer were treated for shoulder injuries. Three people were arrested.[122] In another situation, a 29-year-old shopper was arrested in a Walmart in New Jersey after arguing with a store manager about a TV and attacking an officer. He was charged with disorderly conduct, aggravated assault, and resisting arrest[123]\nIn 2014, three buyers were arrested after a group of five people started fighting at a Kohl's store in Tustin, California. Two female victims were found with facial lacerations, and one of them was taken to hospital with minor injuries, while the other was released on scene. According to officials, three other females were suspects for the assault and were taken into custody.[124] Two people were arrested after a brawl on Black Friday at a northwest side mall in Indianapolis. In Los Angeles, two women were fighting at a Walmart in Norwalk, California, over a Barbie doll on Thanksgiving night.[125]\nSeveral people fighting at a mall in Florence, Kentucky, allegedly over a pair of Air Jordan sneakers. This year was called \"The worst Black Friday brawls in history\" at that time due to the heavy use of smartphones that could instantly capture video.[126]\nIn 2016, 21-year-old Demond Cottman was shot and killed around 01:00 Friday morning outside a Macy's store in New Jersey. The shooter fired multiple shots, leaving an SUV covered in bullet holes, but the motives remain unclear. Cottman's 26-year-old brother was also injured.[127] A shooting at the Wolfchase Galleria Mall in Memphis, Tennessee, left one man injured. Derrick Blackburn, 19, was later arrested for unlawful possession of a weapon.[128]\nIn Vancouver, a shirtless man attacked several people using his belt as a whip. The incident occurred outside an Adidas store where a crowd was awaiting the release of a rare shoe.[129]\nAt the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Alabama, Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., was shot and killed by a security guard after two people were wounded in a shooting.[130] On Saturday, the police announced that the shooter was not Bradford, but claimed he was involved in the shooting.[131][132]\nA fight led to a shooting in the food court of the Destiny USA mall in Syracuse, New York.[133] The mall went into lockdown until shoppers and staff were released starting at about 8:00 P.M. with all shopping activity suspended.[133] 21-year-old Kyree Truax was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, and second-degree reckless endangerment for shooting the victim twice in the leg.[134]\nSome online stores invest a lot of money in promotional campaigns to generate more sales and drive traffic to their stores. However, they often forget about the high loads their sites are going to experience. According to Retail Gazette, \"A number of major retailers' websites went down as they failed to cope with the surge in Black Friday traffic in 2017... This just highlights that some retailers have not taken the necessary steps to prepare for Black Friday. Failing to prepare for peak can cause poor performance, site downtime, and ultimately lost revenue for retailers\".[135] Such carelessness results in huge reputational damage. Moreover, The 2017 Veeam Availability Report shows that \"Unplanned downtime costs organisations around the world an average of R270m annually, up from the R210m of the previous year\".[136]\nSome websites offer information about day-after-Thanksgiving specials up to a month in advance.[137] The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\nThe benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An Internet service provider in 2003 brought suit against Best Buy, Kohl's, and Target Corporation, arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have standing to sue the retailers.[139]\nUsage of Black Friday Advertising Tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the U.S., influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002.[140] The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties, and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult. Cross-border shopping solutions exist to mitigate the problem through estimation of the various cost involved.\nIn 2019, Adobe shopping data showed that around 39% of the shopping was done through smartphones.[141] In 2022, 48% of online sales are made through smartphones, up from 44% in 2021. Meanwhile, consumers spent a record $9.12 billion shopping online during Black Friday this year.[142]\nThe term Cyber Monday, a neologism invented in 2005 by the National Retail Federation's division Shop.org,[143] refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday based on a trend that retailers began to recognize in 2003 and 2004. Retailers noticed that many consumers, who were too busy to shop over the Thanksgiving week-end or did not find what they were looking for, shopped for bargains online that Monday from home or work. In 2010, Hitwise reported:\nThanksgiving weekend offered a strong start, especially as Black Friday sales continued to grow in popularity. For the 2nd consecutive year, Black Friday was the highest day for retail traffic during the holiday season, followed by Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. The highest year-over-year increases in visits took place on Cyber Monday and Black Friday with a growth of 16% and 13%, respectively.[144]\nIn 2013, Cyber Monday online sales grew by 18% over the previous year, hitting a record $1.73 billion, with an average order value of $128.[145]\nIn 2014, Cyber Monday was the busiest day of the year with sales exceeding $2 billion in desktop online spending, up 17% from the previous year.[146]\nAs reported in the Forbes \"Entrepreneurs\" column on December 3, 2013: \"Cyber Monday, the online counterpart to Black Friday, has been gaining unprecedented popularity \u2013 to the point where Cyber Sales are continuing on throughout the week.\"[147] Peter Greenberg, Travel Editor for CBS News, further advises: \"If you want a real deal on Black Friday, stay away from the mall. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are all part of Cyber Week...\"[148]\nThe National Retail Federation releases figures on the sales for each Thanksgiving week-end.[149] The Federation's definition of \"Black Friday week-end\" includes Thursday, Friday, Saturday and projected spending for Sunday. The survey estimates number of shoppers, not number of people.\nThe length of the shopping season is not the same across all years: the date for Black Friday varies between November 23 and 29, while Christmas Eve is fixed at December 24.",

        "context": "\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, God (Yahweh) commanded Moses to tell the Israelites to mark a lamb's blood above their doors in order that the Angel of Death would pass over them (i.e., that they would not be touched by the tenth plague, death of the firstborn). After the death of the firstborn, Pharaoh ordered the Israelites to leave, taking whatever they want, and asked Moses to bless him in the name of the Lord. The passage goes on to state that the Passover sacrifice recalls the time when God \"passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt\".[4] This story is recounted at the Passover meal during the first two evenings of Passover by reading the Haggadah. The Haggadah is a standardized ritual account of the Exodus story, in fulfillment of the command \"And thou shalt tell [Higgadata] thy son in that day, saying: It is because of that which the LORD did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.\"[5]\nNowadays, in addition to the biblical prohibition of owning leavened foods for the duration of the holiday, the Passover Seder, at which the Haggadah is read aloud, is one of the most widely observed rituals in Judaism.\nThe Hebrew\u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7\u200e is rendered as Tiberian[p\u025bsa\u0127]\u24d8, and Modern Hebrew: [\u02c8pesa\u03c7]Pesah, Pesakh. The verb pas\u00e0ch (\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7) is first mentioned in the Torah's account of the Exodus from Egypt,[6] and there is some debate about its exact meaning. The commonly held assumption that it means \"He passed over\" (\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7), in reference to God \"passing over\" (or \"skipping\") the houses of the Hebrews during the final of the Ten Plagues of Egypt, stems from the translation provided in the Septuagint (Ancient Greek: \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, romanized: pareleusetai in Exodus 12:23,[6] and \u1f10\u03c3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd, eskepasen in Exodus 12:27.)[4]Targum Onkelos translates pesach as ve-yei\u1e25os (Hebrew: \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05e1, romanized: we-y\u0113\u1e25\u00f4s), \"he had pity\", coming from the Hebrew root \u05d7\u05e1\u05d4, meaning \"to have pity\".[7] Cognate languages yield similar terms with distinct meanings, such as \"make soft, soothe, placate\" (Akkadianpassahu), \"harvest, commemoration, blow\" (Egyptian), or \"separate\" (Arabicfsh).[8]\nThe term Pesach (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7, Pesa\u1e25) may also refer to the lamb or goat which was designated as the Passover sacrifice (called the Korban Pesach in Hebrew). Four days before the Exodus, the Hebrews were commanded to set aside a lamb,[9] and inspect it daily for blemishes. During the day on the 14th of Nisan, they were to slaughter the animal and use its blood to mark their lintels and door posts. Before midnight on the 15th of Nisan they were to consume the lamb.\nFor the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.[12]\nThe Passover ritual is \"a mitzvah commanded by Torah (rather than of rabbinic origin).\"[13]\nThe Passover ritual is thought by modern scholars to have its origins in an apotropaic rite, unrelated to the Exodus, to ensure the protection of a family home, a rite conducted wholly within a clan.[14]Hyssop was employed to daub the blood of a slaughtered sheep on the lintels and door posts to ensure that demonic forces could not enter the home.[15]\nA further hypothesis maintains that once the Priestly Code was promulgated, the Exodus narrative took on a central function, as the apotropaic rite was, arguably, amalgamated with the Canaanite agricultural festival of spring which was a ceremony of unleavened bread, connected with the barley harvest. As the Exodus motif grew, the original function and symbolism of these double origins was lost.[16] Several motifs replicate the features associated with the MesopotamianAkitu spring festival, which celebrates the sowing of barley.[17] Scholars John Van Seters, J.B.Segal and Tamara Prosic disagree with the merged two-festivals hypothesis.[18]\nIn the Book of Exodus, the Israelites are enslaved in ancient Egypt. Yahweh, the god of the Israelites, appears to Moses in a burning bush and commands Moses to confront Pharaoh. To show his power, Yahweh inflicts a series of 10 plagues on the Egyptians, culminating in the 10th plague, the death of the first-born.\nThis is what the LORD says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt \u2013 worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.\"\n\u2014 Exodus 11:4\u20136\nBefore this final plague Yahweh commands Moses to tell the Israelites to mark a lamb's blood above their doors in order that Yahweh will pass over them (i.e., that they will not be touched by the death of the firstborn).\nThe biblical regulations for the observance of the festival require that all leavening be disposed of before the beginning of the 15th of Nisan.[19] An unblemished lamb or goat, known as the Korban Pesach or \"Paschal Lamb\", is to be set apart on 10th Nisan,[9] and slaughtered at dusk as 14th Nisan ends in preparation for the 15th of Nisan when it will be eaten after being roasted.[20] The literal meaning of the Hebrew is \"between the two evenings\".[21] It is then to be eaten \"that night\", 15th Nisan,[22] roasted, without the removal of its internal organs[23] with unleavened bread, known as matzo, and bitter herbs known as maror.[22] Nothing of the sacrifice on which the sun rises by the morning of the 15th of Nisan may be eaten, but must be burned.[24]\nThe biblical regulations pertaining to the original Passover, at the time of the Exodus only, also include how the meal was to be eaten: \"with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover\".[25]\nThe biblical requirements of slaying the Paschal lamb in the individual homes of the Hebrews and smearing the blood of the lamb on their doorways were celebrated in Egypt. However, once Israel was in the wilderness and the tabernacle was in operation, a change was made in those two original requirements.[26] Passover lambs were to be sacrificed at the door of the tabernacle and no longer in the homes of the Jews. No longer, therefore, could blood be smeared on doorways.\nIn the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk is the LORD's Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.\nThe sacrifices may be performed only in a specific place prescribed by God. For Judaism, this is Jerusalem.[27]\nThe biblical commandments concerning the Passover (and the Feast of Unleavened Bread) stress the importance of remembering:\nExodus 12:14 commands, in reference to God's sparing of the firstborn from the Tenth Plague: \"And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.\"[28]\nExodus 13:3 repeats the command to remember: \"Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength the hand of the LORD brought you out from this place.\"[29]\nDeuteronomy 16:12: \"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes\".[30]\nIn 2 Kings 23:21\u201323 and 2 Chronicles 35:1\u201319, King Josiah of Judah restores the celebration of the Passover,[31] to a standard not seen since the days of the judges or the days of the prophetSamuel.[32]\nSome of these details can be corroborated, and to some extent amplified, in extrabiblical sources. The removal (or \"sealing up\") of the leaven is referred to in the Elephantine papyri, an Aramaic papyrus from 5th century BCE Elephantine in Egypt.[34] The slaughter of the lambs on the 14th is mentioned in The Book of Jubilees, a Jewish work of the Ptolemaic period, and by the Herodian-era writers Josephus and Philo. These sources also indicate that \"between the two evenings\" was taken to mean the afternoon.[35]Jubilees states the sacrifice was eaten that night,[36] and together with Josephus states that nothing of the sacrifice was allowed to remain until morning.[37] Philo states that the banquet included hymns and prayers.[38]\nThe Passover begins on the 15th day of the month of Nisan, which at present falls between March 26 and April 25 of the Gregorian calendar.[39] The 15th day begins in the evening, after the 14th day, and the seder meal is eaten that evening. Passover is a spring festival, so the 15th day of Nisan typically begins on the night of a full moon after the northern vernal equinox.[40] However, due to leap months falling after the vernal equinox, Passover sometimes starts on the second full moon after vernal equinox, as in 2016.\nTo ensure that Passover did not start before spring, the tradition in ancient Israel held that the lunar new year, the first day of Nisan, would not start until the barley was ripe, being the test for the onset of spring.[41] If the barley was not ripe, or various other phenomena[42] indicated that spring was not yet imminent, an intercalary month (Adar II) would be added. However, since at least the 4th century, the intercalation has been fixed mathematically according to the Metonic cycle.[43]\nIn Israel, Passover is the seven-day holiday of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, with the first and last days celebrated as legal holidays and as holy days involving holiday meals, special prayer services, and abstention from work; the intervening days are known as Chol HaMoed (\"Weekdays [of] the Festival\"). Jews outside of Israel celebrate the festival for eight days. Reform and Reconstructionist Jews usually celebrate the holiday over seven days.[44][45][46]Karaites use a different version of the Jewish calendar, differing from that used with modern Jewish calendar by one or two days.[47] The Samaritans use a calendrical system that uses a different method from that current in Jewish practice, in order to determine their timing of feastdays.[48] In 2009, for example, Nisan 15 on the Jewish calendar used by Rabbinic Judaism corresponds to April 9. On the calendars used by Karaites and Samaritans, Abib or Aviv 15 (as opposed to 'Nisan') corresponds to April 11 in 2009. The Karaite and Samaritan Passovers are each one day long, followed by the six-day Festival of Unleavened Bread \u2013 for a total of seven days.[49]\nThe main entity in Passover according to Judaism is the sacrificial lamb.[50] During the existence of the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem, the focus of the Passover festival was the Passover sacrifice (Hebrew: korban Pesach), also known as the Paschal lamb, eaten during the Passover Seder on the 15th of Nisan. Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan,[51] and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan.[52] If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened,[53] and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed[54] and eaten together with unleavened bread (matzo) and bitter herbs (maror). One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering,[55] and none of the meat could be left over by morning.[56]\nBecause of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were an apostate,[57] a servant,[58] an uncircumcised man[59] a person in a state of ritual impurity, except when a majority of Jews are in such a state,[60] and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a quorum of 30.[61] In the Temple, the Levites sang Hallel while the priests performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (Pesahim 91b).\nToday, in the absence of the Temple, when no sacrifices are offered or eaten, the mitzvah of the Korban Pesach is memorialized in the Seder Korban Pesach, a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, customarily recited after the Mincha (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th of Nisan,[62] and in the form of the zeroa, a symbolic food placed on the Passover Seder Plate (but not eaten), which is usually a roasted shankbone (or a chicken wing or neck). The eating of the afikoman substitutes for the eating of the Korban Pesach at the end of the Seder meal (Mishnah Pesachim 119a). Many Sephardi Jews have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the Korban Pesach.\nWashing dishes for passover (1657)Burning chametz on the morning before Passover begins\nLeaven, in Hebrew chametz (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05de\u05e5\u1e25amets, \"leavening\") is made from one of five types of grains[63] combined with water and left to stand for more than eighteen minutes. The consumption, keeping, and owning of chametz is forbidden during Passover. Yeast and fermentation are not themselves forbidden as seen for example by wine, which is required, rather than merely permitted. According to Halakha, the ownership of such chametz is also proscribed.[64]\nChametz does not include baking soda, baking powder or like products. Although these are defined in English as leavening agents, they leaven by chemical reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with baking soda and matzo meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.[65]\nThe Torah commandments regarding chametz are:\nTo remove all chametz from one's home, including things made with chametz, before the first day of Passover[66] It may be simply used up, thrown out (historically, destroyed by burning), or given or sold to non-Jews.\nTo refrain from eating chametz or mixtures containing chametz during Passover.[67]\nObservant Jews spend the weeks before Passover in a flurry of thorough housecleaning, to remove every morsel of chametz from every part of the home. Jewish law requires the elimination of olive-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the seams of kitchen counters are thoroughly cleaned to remove traces of flour and yeast, however small. Any containers or implements that have touched chametz are stored and not used during Passover.[69]\nSome scholars suggest that the command to abstain from leavened food or yeast suggests that sacrifices offered to God involve the offering of objects in \"their least altered state\", that would be nearest to the way in which they were initially made by God.[50][71] According to other scholars the absence of leaven or yeast means that leaven or yeast symbolizes corruption and spoiling.[50][72]\nThere are also variations with restrictions on eating matzah before Passover so that there will be an increased appetite for it during Passover itself. Primarily among Chabad Chassidim, there is a custom of not eating matzoh (flat unleavened bread) in the 30 days before Passover begins.[73] Others have a custom to refrain from eating matzah from Rosh Chodesh Nissan, while the halacha merely restricts one from eating matzah on the day before Passover.[74]\nKitniyot (Hebrew: \u05e7\u05b4\u05d8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, qitniyyot; literally \"small things\") refers to legumes, rice, maize, and other foods that are similar to grains. Ashkenazi Jews historically refrain from eating kitniyot on Passover, despite there not being a clear commandment to include them in the category of chametz.[75] Since the 19th century, the Reform movement has permitted eating kitniyot, and in 2015 the Conservative movement followed suit.[76]Sephardi Jews have always permitted eating kitniyot on Passover.\nGebrochts (Yiddish: \u05d2\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e7\u05d8\u05e1, lit.'broken', also known as Hebrew: \u05de\u05e6\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4, romanized:matzo shruya, lit.'soaked matzo') refers to matzo that has absorbed liquid. Some Hasidic Jews avoid gebrochts as well, to avoid the possibility that a clump of flour that was never properly mixed with water (and thus is still susceptible to leavening) may come into contact with the liquid.[77]\nChametz foods blocked from purchase during Passover in a Jerusalem supermarket\nLeaven or chametz may be sold rather than discarded, especially in the case of relatively valuable forms such as liquordistilled from wheat, with the products being repurchased afterward. In some cases, they may never leave the house, instead being formally sold while remaining in the original owner's possession in a locked cabinet until they can be repurchased after the holiday. Modern observance may also include sealing cabinets and drawers which contain \"Chametz\" shut by using adhesive tape, which serves a similar purpose to a lock but also shows evidence of tampering. Although the practice of selling \"Chametz\" dates back many years, some Reform rabbinical authorities have come to regard it with disdain \u2013 since the supposed \"new owner\" never takes actual possession of the goods.[78]\nThe sale of chametz may also be conducted communally via a rabbi, who becomes the \"agent\" for all the community's Jews through a halakhic procedure called a kinyan (acquisition). Each householder must put aside all the chametz he is selling into a box or cupboard, and the rabbi enters into a contract to sell all the chametz to a non-Jew (who is not obligated to celebrate the commandments) in exchange for a small down payment (e.g. $1.00), with the remainder due after Passover. This sale is considered completely binding according to Halakha, and at any time during the holiday, the buyer may come to take or partake of his property. The rabbi then re-purchases the goods for less than they were sold at the end of the holiday.[79]\nOn the night of the fourteenth of Nisan, the night before the Passover Seder (after nightfall on the evening before Passover eve), Jews do a formal search in their homes known as bedikat chametz for any possible remaining leaven (chametz). The Talmudic sages instructed that a search for chametz be made in every home, place of work, or any place where chametz may have been brought during the year.[80] When the first Seder is on a Saturday night, the search is conducted on the preceding Thursday night (thirteenth of Nisan) as chametz cannot be burned during Shabbat.\nThe Talmud in Pesahim (p. 2a) derives from the Torah that the search for chametz be conducted by the light of a candle and therefore is done at night, and although the final destruction of the chametz (usually by burning it in a small bonfire) is done on the next morning, the blessing is made at night because the search is both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all chametz from one's possession.[80]\nBefore the search is begun there is a special blessing. If several people or family members assist in the search then only one person, usually the head of that family recites the blessing having in mind to include everyone present:[80]\nBlessed are You, Hashem our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the removal of chametz.\nThe search is then usually conducted by the head of the household joined by his family including children under the supervision of their parents.\nIt is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by candlelight, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the chametz. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.\nBecause the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for chametz will be in vain (bracha l'vatala) if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some chametz will be found.\nUpon conclusion of the search, with all the small pieces safely wrapped up and put in one bag or place, to be burned the next morning, the following is said:\nAny chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\nOn the day preceding the first Passover seder (or on Thursday morning preceding the seder, when the first seder falls on Motza'ei Shabbat), firstborn sons are commanded to celebrate the Fast of the Firstborn which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to Exodus 12:29, God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected.[81] However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a siyum (ceremony marking the completion of a section of Torah learning) right after morning prayers, and the celebratory meal that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.\nOn the morning of the 14th of Nisan, any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (s'rayfat chametz). The head of the household repeats the declaration of biyur chametz, declaring any chametz that may not have been found to be null and void \"as the dust of the earth\":\nAny chametz or leaven that is in my possession which I have not seen and have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.\nShould more chametz actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.\nUnlike chametz, which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends.\nThe historic \"Paschal lamb\" Passover sacrifice (Korban Pesach) has not been brought following the Romans' destruction of the Second Jewish temple approximately two thousand years ago, and it is therefore still not part of the modern Jewish holiday.\nIn the times when the Jewish Temples stood, the lamb was slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover and was completely consumed before the morning as described in Exodus 12:3\u201311.[82]\nEven Kosher for Passover matzah cannot be eaten all day Erev Pesach.[83] Some even practice this up to 30 days before.[84] In some way this restriction is analogous[citation needed] to how the blowing of the Shofar, done by Ashkenazic Jews the month preceding Rosh Hashana, is not done on the day before that Holiday.\nDue to the Torah injunction not to eat chametz (leaven) during Passover,[66] observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with chametz, for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some chametz utensils can be immersed in boiling water (hagalat keilim) to purge them of any traces of chametz that may have accumulated during the year. Many Sephardic families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that glass does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a blow torch to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called libun gamur).[85]\nA symbol of the Passover holiday is matzo, an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.[86] Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the Passover Seder. There are several explanations for this.\nThe Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.[87] Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.\nMatzo has also been called Lechem Oni (Hebrew: \"bread of poverty\"). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.[88]\nHand-made shmura matzo\nShmura matzo (\"watched\" or \"guarded\" matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in Orthodox Jewish communities. Shmura matzo is made from wheat that is guarded from contamination by leaven (chametz) from the time of summer harvest[63] to its baking into matzos five to ten months later.\nIn the weeks before Passover, matzos are prepared for holiday consumption. In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (\"chaburas\") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. Chaburas also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.\nThe baking of matzo is labor-intensive,[63] as less than 18 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;[89] this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.\nAfter the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now chametz, and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.\nSome machine-made matzos are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.[63]\nIt is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in Orthodox and Conservative communities outside Israel) for a special dinner called a seder (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05d3\u05e8seder \u2013 derived from the Hebrew word for \"order\" or \"arrangement\", referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the Haggadah. A total of four cups of wine are consumed during the recitation of the Haggadah. The seder is divided by the haggadah into the following 15 parts:\nKadeish/ Qad\u0113sh\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9 \u2013 recital of Kiddush blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine\nThe seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of Kiddush which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the afikoman, the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including Chad Gadya (\"One Little Kid\" or \"One Little Goat\").\nMaror (bitter herbs) symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in Egypt. The following verse from the Torah underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered (Hebrew: \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5 ve-yimareru) their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" (Exodus 1:14).\nSilver seder plate\nThere is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of the Exodus, the drinking of the third cup concludes Birkat Hamazon and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel. A fifth cup of wine is poured near the end of the seder for Eliyahu HaNavi, a symbol of the future redemption, which is left un-touched.[91]\nChildren have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:\nWhy is this night different from all other nights?\nOn all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?\nOn all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?\nOn all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?\nOn all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?\nOften the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, \"The more one talks about the Exodus from Egypt, the more praiseworthy he is.\" Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.\n14th century Haggadah\nThe afikoman \u2013 an integral part of the Seder itself \u2013 is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called Yachatz, the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the afikoman. Many families use the afikoman as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the afikoman and offering a prize for its return.[63] Alternatively, the children are allowed to \"steal\" the afikoman and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the afikoman must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, Tzafun.\nAfter the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in \"Next year in Jerusalem!\". This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. \"Echad Mi Yodea\" (\"Who Knows One?\") is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as \"Chad Gadya\" are allegorical.\nDuring Passover, the recitation of Hallel a collection of Psalms praising and thanking God, is an integral part of the daily prayer service. On the initial day(s) of Passover, it is recited in its entirety, similar to the practice observed on Shavuot and throughout Succot. However, for the subsequent days of the Passover holiday, only half of the Hallel is recited. This traditional practice is widely observed by adherents of the Jewish faith as a way of expressing gratitude and celebrating the significance of Passover, while maintaining variations in the recitation of Hallel based on specific days within the festival.[92][93]\nBeginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,[94] Jews begin the practice of the Counting of the Omer, a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of Shavuot 50 days hence. Each night after the evening prayer service, men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, \"Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer\"; on the second night, \"Today is the second day in the Omer.\" The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, \"Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.\" The eighth day is marked, \"Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,\" etc.[95]\nOn the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an issaron for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.[96]\nSince the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.\nOne explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and mitzvot before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering \u2013 a measure of barley, typically animal fodder \u2013 and the Shavuot offering \u2013 two loaves of wheat bread, human food \u2013 symbolizes the transition process.[97]\nOutside Israel, in Orthodox and Conservative communities, the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays. In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. Reform Judaism observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being major holidays.\nLike the holiday of Sukkot, the intermediary days of Passover are known as Chol HaMoed (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as macaroons and homemade candies.[98]\nPassover cake recipes call for potato starch or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use matzo farfel (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base. For families with Eastern European backgrounds, borsht, a soup made with beets, is a Passover tradition.[99]\nWhile kosher for Passover packaged goods are available in stores, some families opt to cook everything from scratch during Passover week. In Israel, families that do not kasher their ovens can bake cakes, casseroles, and even meat[100] on the stovetop in a Wonder Pot, an Israeli invention consisting of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a center hole which is placed between the Wonder Pot and the flame to disperse heat.[101]\nShvi'i shel Pesach (\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7, 'seventh [day] of Passover') is another full Jewish holiday, with special prayer services and festive meals. Outside the Israel, in the Jewish diaspora, Shvi'i shel Pesach is celebrated on both the seventh and eighth days of Passover.[102] This holiday commemorates the day the Children of Israel reached the Red Sea and witnessed both the miraculous \"Splitting of the Sea\" (Passage of the Red Sea), the drowning of all the Egyptian chariots, horses and soldiers that pursued them. According to the Midrash, only the Pharaoh was spared to give testimony to the miracle that occurred.\nHasidicRebbes traditionally hold a tish on the night of Shvi'i shel Pesach and place a cup or bowl of water on the table before them. They use this opportunity to speak about the Splitting of the Sea to their disciples, and sing songs of praise to God.[103]\nToday, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has the status of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it essentially does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.[107]\nCharoset \u2013 A sweet mixture of fruit, fresh, dried or both; nuts; spices; honey; and sometimes wine. The charoset is a symbol of the mortar the Israelites used for building while enslaved in Egypt (See Passover seder)\nThat slaves can go free, and that the future can be better than the present, has inspired a number of religious sermons, prayers, and songs \u2013 including spirituals (what used to be called \"Negro Spirituals\"), within the African-American community. Philip R. Alstat, known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills, wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the Passover story during the rise of Nazi persecution and terror:[109]\nSome see in Passover an important ecological lesson important to the contemporary situation with different ecological threats like climate change. For example, Rabbi Yonatan Neril, founder and executive director of the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development compare the impacts of climate change to the Plagues of Egypt and the refusal of modern society to change its way of thinking is compared to the refusal of the Pharaoh to free the Jewish slaves.[126] Scientists discover evidence for a climatic change in the end of the ruling of Ramesses II which can potentially impact the flow of Nile, leading to Red algae bloom which can potentially cause effects close to those described as the ten plagues. According to Neril: \"\"The Egyptians were very happy to have a free source of labor in the form of Israelite slaves. When God said this needs to stop, they were reluctant to change,\" \"Fossil fuels, in the past 150 years, have replaced slave labor as the key driver of human society. There's a Pharaoh within us that wants to continue to do something that's not right.\"[127][128]\n^James B.

Christ as the Passover Lamb from Exodus A number of features throughout Revelation seem to correspond to Exodus 12: The connection of Lamb and Passover, a salvific effect of the Lamb's blood and the punishment of God's (and His people's) opponents from Exodus 12 may possibly be reflected within the settings of the Apocalypse. The concept of Christ as a Passover lamb is generally not unknown in NT or early Christian literature, as can for instance be seen in 1 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Peter 1:19 or Justin Martyr's writing (Dial. 111:3). In the Gospel of John, especially, this connection between Christ and Passover is made very explicit.",

Worldwide, 108 tornado-related deaths have been confirmed, 75 of them in the United States, 12 in China, nine in Indonesia, eight in Myanmar, three in Turkey, and one in Saudi Arabia.\nJanuary saw the third-highest number of tornado watches and confirmed tornadoes of any January on record in the United States.[3] Additionally, the first two months of the year saw the fourth-highest number of confirmed tornadoes for the first 59 days of any year on record.[4] In addition, the year has been deadlier than average, with multiple fatal tornadoes. By April 5, 63 deaths from tornadoes had been recorded in the United States; this was almost three times higher than 2022's total of 23 deaths and approaching the annual average of roughly 70 deaths.[5] Although below average tornadic activity occurred in May, near average tornado activity caused an additional nine deaths in June.\nIn early January, a three-day severe weather outbreak brought damaging winds, large hail, and numerous tornadoes to the Southern United States and impacted the Midwestern United States to a lesser extent. On January 2, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for all of Arkansas and parts of surrounding states, with a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes. An EF1 tornado damaged homes and the high school in Jessieville, Arkansas, injuring two people.[8][9][10] A large 1.1-mile-wide (1.8 km) EF2 tornado caused severe damage near Jonesboro, Louisiana, snapping many large trees, inflicting significant damage to several residences, and injuring three people.[8] Another strong EF2 tornado knocked down metal truss electrical transmission towers near Haile and destroyed an outbuilding. A third large, long-tracked EF2 tornado damaged or destroyed multiple houses, vehicles, and a mobile home in Montrose, Arkansas, and snapped or uprooted countless trees and many power poles along its path.[8][11] The next day, another enhanced risk was issued farther east in the Gulf Coast region, with a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes in place for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. An EF2 tornado downed many large trees, tore most of the roof off a house, caused roof damage to other homes, and destroyed boathouses and outbuildings at the Jordan Lake Reservoir near Deatsville, Alabama. Several tornadoes touched down as far north as Illinois, including two separate EF0 and EF1 tornadoes that caused damage to outbuildings and farm equipment near Maroa. Another pair of EF1 and EF0 tornadoes also briefly touched down in Decatur, with the EF1 tornado damaging a vacant bowling alley and the EF0 tornado causing minor damage at Richland Community College. Tornadoes continued touching down into the morning of January 4, including a high-end EF1 tornado that damaged several homes, flipped cars, and severely injured a person on the eastern side of Montgomery, Alabama. In Georgia, an EF1 tornado struck the small community of Roosterville, where a barn and a mobile home were destroyed. An EF1 tornado also struck Sandersville, where homes and a warehouse were damaged and many trees were downed, some of which landed on structures. A semi-truck was overturned in Sandersville, injuring the driver.[8][12] Additional weak tornadoes touched down across parts of the Carolinas later that day before the outbreak came to an end.\nNEXRAD velocity imagery showing the paths of six tornadoes near Griffin, Georgia. The circulation in the red circle is the one that produced the main EF3 Griffin tornado, while the one in the pink produced the deadly EF2 Jackson Lake tornado.\nA significant tornado outbreak impacted the Southeastern United States, with several strong and long-tracked tornadoes touching down and causing multiple fatalities. On January 12, the SPC issued an enhanced risk of severe weather, including a 10% risk area for tornadoes. Multiple supercell thunderstorms formed in the threat area later that day, and significant tornadoes began touching down. In Alabama, the small towns of Emelle, Eutaw, and Movico were all impacted by EF2 tornadoes, resulting in extensive damage. A large high-end EF2 tornado also caused severe structural damage in Selma, Alabama. Many homes and businesses sustained major damage in Selma, and a daycare with 70 children plus workers was destroyed, but only one minor injury occurred inside, one of two injuries reported from the tornado. The same storm that produced the Selma tornado later produced a long-tracked EF3 tornado that prompted tornado emergencies for Autauga, Elmore, Chilton, Coosa, and northern Tallapoosa counties.[21] This deadly tornado caused seven fatalities in the Old Kingston community of Autauga County as it completely obliterated numerous mobile homes, as well as tossing vehicles and causing massive timber damage.[22] Multiple strong tornadoes, which were all spawned by the Selma supercell, also impacted parts of Georgia, including an EF2 tornado that inflicted major damage to homes and industrial buildings in the southern part of LaGrange. A large EF3 tornado struck the western edge of Griffin and Experiment, badly damaging or destroying homes and businesses, and flipping cars. This tornado was accompanied by three other tornadoes at the beginning of its track near Griffin, including a high-end EF2 tornado that caused considerable damage to homes and trees. Another high-end EF2 tornado also caused significant damage in Jenkinsburg and near Jackson Lake, resulting in one fatality when a tree fell onto a car along with an indirect fatality the next day when falling tree limb knocked a transportation worker out of a bucket truck while he working to restore power lines.[23] A high-end EF1 tornado also touched down near the Atlanta suburb of Mableton, damaging an industrial business and downing many trees, some of which landed on homes. Other weak tornadoes were confirmed in parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and the Carolinas. Overall, this outbreak produced a total of 41 tornadoes and resulted in eight fatalities, along with at least 53 injuries.[24]\nOn January 17, a brief but strong tornado struck Valmontone, which is a comune in the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital, causing significant damage and injuring 2 people. The tornado was spawned by an embedded \"comma head\" circulation and was captured by a surveillance camera. Multiple homes, apartment buildings, and other structures suffered severe roof damage, and the top floor of one residence was completely destroyed. Trees, gates, and fences were knocked down, and debris was strewn across yards and roads. The European Severe Storms Laboratory rated the tornado F2 on the Fujita scale, with a path length of 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi) and a maximum width of 150 metres (160 yd).[25] After the tornado, Valmontone declared a state of disaster.[26]\nA line of severe storms produced damaging straight-line winds and multiple tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle and Southeast Georgia throughout January 22, including two low-end EF2 tornadoes. The first one struck the community of Turquoise Beach, Florida, to the northeast of Santa Rosa Beach, downing trees and damaging several homes. Three of the houses that were damaged had significant portions of their roofs uplifted.[27] The other strong tornado struck the northern side of Adel, Georgia, shifting multiple buildings off their foundations, including a metal structure that was completely destroyed. It also destroyed a motorhome, knocked over a series of centerline irrigation pivots, and damaged trees, some of which fell on homes.[27] Three EF1 tornadoes also touched down elsewhere in Georgia that day, bringing the final tornado tally to five.[8]\nNEXRAD radar data of the EF3 tornado in Deer Park, Texas. An annular ring of debris circling the tornado is visible on the correlation coefficient (bottom left)\nOn January 24, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for much of the Gulf Coast region, including a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes. Throughout the day, a small but significant outbreak of tornadoes impacted the Southern United States, primarily from Southeast Texas to southern Louisiana. Multiple strong tornadoes were confirmed, including a large and destructive low-end EF3 tornado that moved through the southeastern sections of the Houston metropolitan area, impacting the suburbs of Pasadena and Deer Park.[28] This prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency, the first ever issued by the National Weather Service's forecast office in Houston.[29][30] The intense rain-wrapped tornado inflicted major structural damage to many homes, apartment buildings, churches, and businesses, and downed many trees and power lines. Cars were thrown and mangled, a metal building was destroyed, a senior center sustained major damage, and metal truss electrical transmission towers were toppled to the ground. No fatalities occurred as a result of the EF3 Houston metro tornado, though a few minor injuries were reported. The tornado caused $6.6 million in damage.[31][32] The same storm also produced two EF0 tornadoes that caused minor damage in the Houston suburbs of Sienna and Pearland prior to spawning the EF3 tornado. Elsewhere, a brief EF2 tornado unroofed a house and destroyed a barn near Nome. Three people were injured by another EF2 tornado that touched down near Orangefield before striking the outskirts of Orange, causing major damage to mobile homes, houses, and outbuildings before crossing into Louisiana and inflicting more severe damage to numerous structures north of Vinton. Several metal buildings were also damaged, and many large trees were snapped or uprooted by this tornado as well. In Louisiana, another EF2 tornado struck the small community of Gaytine, where houses had their roofs torn off, a mobile home was destroyed, a metal building was heavily damaged, and a fifth-wheel RV trailer was flipped. In Ventress, three people were injured by an EF1 tornado that destroyed a few mobile homes.[33] Three additional weak tornadoes touched down in Florida on January 25 before the outbreak came to an end. A total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed. In addition to the tornadoes, the storms also produced flash flooding and a daily record for rainfall was set in Houston, at 4.05 in (103 mm).[34] The flash flooding forced SH 99 to temporarily close.[35]\nOn February 1, multiple severe thunderstorms formed in Germany, producing two tornadoes. The first was a short-lived F1 tornado which tracked for 0.2 km (0.1 mi), damaging the roofs of 14 homes in Hinte.[25][36] The second tornado struck areas near the small villages of Getmold, Lashorst and Hedem along a 5.3 km (3.3 mi)-long path, snapping or uprooting large trees and heavily damaging the roofs of multiple homes. A car was damaged by a falling tree near Lashorst, a carriage house had its roof torn off, and a carport was damaged at a farmstead. The most significant damage occurred in an area of pine forest, where many large trees were completely mowed down or stripped of their limbs, and a few tree trunks were snapped off and thrown some distance into nearby fields. Based on the severe tree damage, the second tornado was given an F2 rating.[25][37] Over 85 severe weather reports were documented in Europe that day, 69 of those in Germany.[25][38]\nLow-end EF2 damage to a gas station convenience store in Tangipahoa, Louisiana.\nOn February 8, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk of severe weather for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, including a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes. A line of severe storms produced damaging straight-line winds and multiple tornadoes in Mississippi and Louisiana throughout the day, a couple of which were strong. An EF2 tornado struck the village of Tangipahoa in eastern Louisiana, damaging trees and structures in town, including a church and gas station convenience store. Numerous mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in town, a vacant business was unroofed, and many trees were snapped or uprooted as well. Another EF2 tornado struck the community of Grand Prairie, Louisiana, where a well-built home had its roof torn off and trees were snapped. A few other homes and outbuildings along its path suffered more minor damage. Several other weaker tornadoes touched down during the evening across the same region. After roughly 24 hours of no activity, a ninth tornado associated with the same storm system touched down in the Florida Panhandle late on February 9, snapping or uprooting numerous trees near Eucheeanna. In total, nine tornadoes were confirmed.[8]\nEF2 damage to electrical transmission towers west of Ripley, Mississippi.\nOn February 16, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for parts of the Southeastern United States and the Ohio Valley region, including a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes in parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Severe thunderstorms developed later that day, producing damaging winds, large hail, and several tornadoes, a couple of which were strong. An EF2 tornado near Pindall, Arkansas, destroyed barns, pushed a house off its foundation, snapped trees, and injured two people.[39] Another EF2 tornado injured one person, snapped many trees, and knocked over a few metal truss electrical transmission towers near Ripley, Mississippi, before weakening and striking the north edge of town, where a few homes and businesses sustained minor damage. An EF1 tornado that occurred near Wesson, Mississippi, rolled and destroyed a mobile home, and damaged two other residences. An EF1 tornado near Ramer, Tennessee, inflicted heavy roof damage to a home and destroyed two garages, and another EF1 tornado near Lewisburg damaged homes, destroyed barns and outbuildings, and downed trees. On February 17, an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage as it moved through the south side of LaGrange, Georgia, not far from where a damaging EF2 tornado had struck the prior month. Many trees were snapped or uprooted in LaGrange, while homes and businesses sustained roof and window damage. Overall, a total of 13 tornadoes were confirmed. In addition to tornadoes, straight-line winds from the system led to a tree falling at the Northwestern University campus, injuring four people.[40] Flooding caused by the storms also killed two people, one in Kentucky and one in West Virginia.[41] Flooding also resulted in I-65 being shut down near Cullman, Alabama.[42]\nThe high-end EF2 Cheyenne, Oklahoma tornado, illuminated by a power flash.\nOn February 26, a large storm system produced a wide range of significant weather events across a large area of the United States, ranging from heavy snow to tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for west-central Oklahoma for a 45% hatched risk area for damaging winds. The outlook also included a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes. An enhanced risk also extended from the Texas Panhandle to southwestern Missouri. Aided by very strong wind shear, a powerful squall line of severe thunderstorms containing damaging straight-line winds and multiple embedded QLCS tornadoes formed and moved through the risk area later that night. A high-end EF2 tornado obliterated manufactured homes, tossed vehicles, and killed one person as it moved through the outskirts of Cheyenne, Oklahoma, injuring three others as well.[43] The line of severe storms also produced five tornadoes that impacted areas in and around the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, a couple of which were strong. This included a high-end EF2 tornado that struck the southeastern part of Norman, where homes and businesses sustained major damage, self-storage units were destroyed, cars were flipped, and 12 people were injured. Another high-end EF2 tornado also caused significant damage to homes and other structures near Shawnee. In addition, there were widespread reports of damaging straight-line winds that reached up to 70\u201380 mph (110\u2013130 km/h), with locally higher gusts reported, including a 114 mph (183 km/h) wind gust in Memphis, Texas.[44][45] Tornadic activity continued the next day in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio as the system pushed eastward. Several weak tornadoes occurred, including a high-end EF1 tornado that touched down in Jacksonburg, Ohio, before it passed near Middletown, causing considerable damage to a few homes, barns, and trees. In all, 30 tornadoes were confirmed, resulting in one tornado-related fatality; the 12 tornadoes in Oklahoma set the record for the most tornadoes ever recorded in the state in the month of February. In addition, there were 12 other non-tornado-related fatalities that occurred as a result of the storm system.[46]\nA mobile home that was destroyed by a high-end EF2 tornado near Kirby, Arkansas. Two minor injuries occurred at this location.\nIn early March, a powerful storm system brought widespread severe weather, including multiple tornadoes, across a large portion of the Eastern United States. On March 1, the Storm Prediction Center outlined an enhanced risk across areas in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee, including a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes.[47] In Shottsville, Alabama, a low-end EF1 tornado caused minor damage to a church, before downing trees and damaging the roof of a house elsewhere along the path. A stronger, but short-lived high-end EF1 tornado touched down in a subdivision near Hazel Green, Alabama, where a few homes sustained extensive damage and a vehicle was flipped onto its side. On March 2, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for the following day for parts of Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. A 15% hatched risk for tornadoes was in place across the Ark-La-Tex region, with the potential for strong tornadoes noted, although this was downgraded to a 10% hatched area due to lingering uncertainties about the convective modes that day. However, a 45% hatched area for wind damage was also in place in the same general area as well. A high-end EF2 tornado completely demolished two chicken houses and a mobile home, snapped many trees and power poles, partially unroofed a house, and injured five people near Kirby, Arkansas.[48] Several other tornadoes touched down throughout the threat area, though all were weak. This included an EF1 tornado that damaged numerous homes and a few businesses as it moved through the southeastern side of Shreveport, Louisiana, injuring two people. A high-end EF1 tornado also damaged multiple buildings as it impacted Pickton, Texas. On March 3, the storm system moved into the Ohio Valley region, where an EF2 tornado in the small community or Fremont, Kentucky, destroyed outbuildings, heavily damaged a church, and tore the roofs off of a few homes. In Vanderburgh County, Indiana, an EF1 tornado unroofed a church and damaged many homes and trees in the Saint Joseph community. Another EF1 tornado tracked from Duff to the northwestern part of Jasper, downing many trees, damaging or destroying a few barns, and inflicting roof and siding damage to homes. In Highland County, Ohio, an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage to homes and outbuildings in and around Pricetown, downed numerous trees and tree limbs, and tore much of the roof off a church elsewhere along its path. Farther south, two EF1 tornadoes in Alabama caused minor to moderate damage in and around Section and Rosalie. An EF1 tornado also downed many trees in and around Gray Court, South Carolina, some of which landed on houses. In addition to the tornadoes, the severe thunderstorms brought numerous reports of damaging straight-line winds and flooding. Overall, a total of 33 tornadoes were confirmed. While no tornado-related fatalities occurred, at least 13 non-tornado-related deaths occurred as a result of the storm system.[49][50]\nOn March 9, a strong tornado was caught on video from multiple angles as it impacted areas in and around several small towns and villages in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France, resulting in extensive damage. The tornado first badly damaged the roof of a school in Masbaraud-M\u00e9rignat before it moved to the northeast and struck Pontarion, where multiple homes and other structures had their roofs heavily damaged, and one house was completely unroofed. Vehicles in town were damaged by flying debris, trees and power poles were downed, a large masonry storage building was partially destroyed, and roof tiles and other projectiles were found driven into the exterior insulation layers of homes. The tornado also caused significant tree damage as it moved through wooded areas outside of Pontarion, snapping and uprooting many large trees, while multiple outbuildings were damaged or destroyed as well. Towards the end of the path, 17 homes sustained minor damage in the Le Donzeil area before the tornado dissipated. The tornado was rated F2 by the ESSL (European Severe Storms Laboratory) and the French Observatory of Tornadoes and Violent Thunderstorms (Keraunos).[51] Keraunos noted that the environment where the tornado formed was conducive for tornado development, as high instability and shear were present in France that day.[52][53]\nA large dusty tornado caused significant damage as it touched down near the outskirts of Taif, Saudi Arabia on March 13, resulting in one fatality. A few buildings sustained major damage, including loss of roofs and exterior walls. Power poles and iron fence posts were knocked over, while cars and trucks were thrown and severely damaged. A man was killed by flying debris, and at least one person was severely injured.[54][55]\nOn the morning of March 22, a high-end EF1 tornado impacted the Los Angeles suburb of Montebello, causing considerable damage. The tornado moved through an industrial area, where multiple warehouses had large sections of their roofs torn off. One warehouse sustained almost total collapse of its roof and had an HVAC unit ripped off. Signs were damaged or destroyed, windows were shattered, and numerous vehicles were damaged by flying debris. A power pole and some trees were downed, a semi-trailer was tipped over, and debris was scattered throughout the area. One person was injured. This was the strongest tornado to impact the Greater Los Angeles metro area since 1983.[56][57][58] The storm also brought 1.01 in (26 mm) of rain to Los Angeles, breaking a daily rainfall record.[59]\nA large and photogenic cone tornado struck Fazilka in India on March 24, resulting in significant damage. At least 50 unreinforced masonry homes were severely damaged or completely destroyed. Farming equipment was tossed, trees were snapped or uprooted, power poles were downed, and significant crop damage occurred in farm fields. No fatalities occurred, though at least 12 people were injured.[60][61][62]\nBeginning on March 24, a four-day severe weather and tornado outbreak impacted the Southeastern United States. The outbreak began in the morning with two EF1 tornadoes causing injuries in Texas before more significant tornadoes impacted Mississippi that night. One long-tracked and violent high-end EF4 tornado with windspeeds up to 195 mph prompted a tornado emergency for Rolling Fork and Silver City, causing major damage in both communities, with widespread and catastrophic damage occurring throughout much of Rolling Fork. A total of 17 people were killed by the Rolling Fork tornado. Another intense tornado from the same storm prompted another tornado emergency as it struck Winona; three people were killed by this EF3 tornado. Another destructive EF3 tornado from the same storm also caused major damage near or in the communities of Egypt, New Wren, and Amory, resulting in major damage and two fatalities. More tornadoes touched down in Alabama and Tennessee later that night and into the early morning hours of March 25, including an EF2 tornado that caused damage in Fayetteville, Tennessee, and another EF2 tornado that killed one person in Hartselle, Alabama, early on March 25.[63][64][65] From March 26 into March 27, the slow-moving storm system completely stalled out, and more severe weather occurred over the next two days as well, producing several additional tornadoes, including an EF3 tornado that struck just north of West Point, Georgia, on March 26, causing major damage to trees and houses and injuring five people. A total of 33 tornadoes were confirmed as a result of this outbreak, which killed 23 people and injured many others.\nLow-end EF4 damage to a home north of Keota, Iowa from a violent tornado.\nA large, widespread, and deadly tornado outbreak impacted large portions of the Midwestern, Southern, and Eastern United States. A high risk was issued for two areas in the Mississippi Valley on the morning of March 31; it was the first high risk issuance since March 25, 2021. That afternoon, a high-end EF3 wedge tornado passed through the Little Rock, Arkansas, metro area, prompting a tornado emergency as it inflicted significant damage to numerous structures. One person was killed by that tornado. Later, an intense high-end EF3 tornado caused severe damage near Martinsburg, Iowa. The same storm then produced a violent low-end EF4 tornado that destroyed multiple homes near Keota. The Iowa towns of Coralville, Hills, Mediapolis, and Charlotte all sustained significant damage after being impacted by EF2 tornadoes. EF2 tornadoes also caused severe damage in Sherman and Geneseo, Illinois, as well. Several other large tornadoes touched down throughout that afternoon and evening, including an EF3 tornado that killed four people in Wynne, Arkansas, and another EF3 tornado that killed a person in Covington, Tennessee. An EF1 tornado that struck Belvidere, Illinois, collapsed the roof of the Apollo Theatre, which was hosting a sold-out concert, resulting in one fatality and over 40 injuries.[66] Later, another destructive EF3 tornado killed six people when it struck Robinson, Illinois, and Sullivan, Indiana, before the cell traveled northwest, producing another EF3 tornado that destroyed homes, tossed cars and farm machinery, and killed two people near Spencer. The same supercell later spawned an EF3 tornado which directly impacted the town of Whiteland, where a warehouse and many homes were destroyed.[67] Another destructive and long-tracked EF3 tornado killed nine people in McNairy County, Tennessee, impacting the outskirts of Bethel Springs and Adamsville. A high-end EF3 tornado north of Hazel Green, Alabama, also destroyed homes and killed a person early on April 1. More severe weather occurred the next day along the eastern Great Lakes and East Coast, producing widespread damaging winds along with isolated hail and tornadoes. This included one destructive EF3 tornado that killed a person in Sussex County, Delaware. The tornado was the largest ever recorded in Delaware and only the second killer tornado and the second tornado rated F3/EF3 in the state since modern records began in 1950. Seven tornadoes also touched down in New Jersey, three of which reached EF2 intensity. In all, 147 tornadoes making it the 3rd largest tornado outbreak in recorded history, along with 26 tornadic fatalities, one indirect tornado-related fatality, and at least 211 injuries were confirmed as a result of this tornado outbreak. Six non-tornadic deaths also occurred during the outbreak.\nAnother severe weather and tornado outbreak affected the Midwestern United States, Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes in early April. On April 4, a moderate risk was issued by the SPC for parts of Illinois and Iowa, with a second moderate risk outlined for parts of Arkansas and Missouri. A 15% hatched risk area for tornadoes was in place for both moderate risk areas. Multiple tornadoes touched down throughout the afternoon and evening, including two EF1 tornadoes that touched down in the Quad Cities metro area, downing trees and damaging the roofs of homes in Rock Island and Moline, Illinois. Near Pleasantville, Iowa, a narrow and highly photogenic high-end EF1 tornado was caught on video by many storm chasers, and caused damage to homes and outbuildings. The most intense tornado of the event was a large high-end EF3 tornado that destroyed homes and injured four people near Lewistown, Illinois, before striking Bryant, causing significant damage in the small village. A storm chaser's vehicle was rolled by the tornado, though he was not injured.[68] A brief EF2 tornado ripped the roof off a gas station in Colona, while another EF2 tornado destroyed outbuildings and uplifted the roof of a house near Geneseo. A high-end EF1 tornado also caused damage to homes, garages, and trees in Table Grove. During the early morning hours of April 5, a nighttime high-end EF2 tornado struck the communities of Grassy and Glen Allen, Missouri, causing severe damage as multiple homes had their roofs torn off, a few of which sustained failure of exterior walls. Outbuildings and mobile homes were also obliterated by the tornado, with five people being killed in one of the mobile homes.[69][70][71] This became the deadliest tornado in Missouri since the 2011 Joplin tornado.[72]\nOn April 10, a few tornadoes occurred in the Mediterranean region of Europe. The most significant tornado touched down in the A\u011fa\u00e7\u00f6ren District of Aksaray Province in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey. It tracked through or near the villages of Camili, Av\u015far, K\u0131r\u0131mini and G\u00f6ll\u00fc along a 22 km-path (14 mi) with a maximum width of 200 m (220 yd). The tornado, which was rated F2, destroyed the roofs of homes, partially collapsed walls, and killed farm animals. Masonry outbuildings were destroyed, a tractor-trailer was overturned, while trees and power line pylons were downed as well. The minaret tower at the G\u00f6ll\u00fc mosque collapsed, injuring a 26-year-old man. A separate F1 tornado also struck areas in and around Budak, where another mosque also sustained collapse of its minaret tower, outbuildings were destroyed at dairy farms, and some homes had roof damage. In addition, a waterspout made landfall near Pizzo in Southern Italy, causing no damage.[80]\nOn April 15, a linear complex of severe thunderstorms with embedded circulations developed in Missouri and moved eastward through the St. Louis metro area, producing multiple tornadoes. A strong EF2 tornado destroyed a small house near Vichy, Missouri, heavily damaged metal airplane hangars at Rolla National Airport, and injured five people. An EF1 tornado moved through the St. Louis suburbs of Fenton and Sunset Hills, causing damage to homes, warehouses, and trees. The towns of Hillsboro, Festus, and Pevely were also directly hit by EF1 tornadoes, resulting in minor to moderate damage. Another EF1 tornado struck Belleville, Illinois, where homes, apartment buildings, and businesses had roofing blown off and large trees were snapped or uprooted, some of which landed on structures. Farther south, an isolated EF1 tornado caused damage to trees and homes near Ringgold, Louisiana. A total of 14 tornadoes were confirmed, and numerous reports of damaging straight-line winds were received as well.[8][81] The National Centers for Environmental Information documented that this storm system caused $1.1 billion (2023 USD) in damage.[79] The line of storms also forced the Kansas City Royals to postpone a baseball game against the Atlanta Braves.[82]\nA tornado struck areas near the large city of Linyi, Shandong Province, with significant damage observed in the Tancheng County village of Lizhuangzhen. The tornado was captured on video from multiple angles, some from close range. Homes and other structures were severely damaged, including some that sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls, while tractors and cars were tossed. Metal truss transmission towers, power poles, and masonry fences were toppled over, and outbuilding structures were destroyed as well. Trees were snapped, and several people were injured. Another tornado was reported in northern Shandong Province as well. Neither of the tornadoes were officially rated.[83][84][85][86]\nA large high-end EF3 tornado that caused severe damage in and around Cole, Oklahoma.\nOn April 19, a tornado outbreak impacted areas in the southern Great Plains. In Oklahoma, 18 tornadoes touched down and moved erratically near the southern and eastern outskirts of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Several of the tornadoes were strong, and most of them were produced by a large, slow-moving supercell that moved east-northeastward.[87][88] A large high-end EF3 tornado impacted the community of Cole, heavily damaging or destroying homes, mobile homes, and other structures, resulting in a fatality. An indirect fatality from the tornado was also confirmed.[89][90][91][92][93][94] The supercell also produced multiple weak tornadoes and two large, high-end EF2 tornadoes that caused significant damage near Etowah,[95] before merging with another tornadic supercell to its west. This cluster of storms spawned a large, broad mesocyclone that produced several circulations that rotated around each other due to the Fujiwhara effect.[95][96] These circulations produced multiple erratic-moving strong tornadoes after sunset, including EF3 and EF2 tornadoes south and north of Pink respectively, and a very large, high-end EF2 tornado that struck Shawnee, where numerous homes and other buildings sustained extensive damage or were destroyed, including buildings at Oklahoma Baptist University and Shawnee High School. A news-gathering Bell 206 B3 JetRanger helicopter operated by Tulsa television station KOTV was damaged at the Shawnee Regional Airport, along with several hangars.[97][98][99][100]\nFurther north, a supercell produced a series of eight tornadoes in Chase County, Kansas, near Strong City, including an EF0 tornado that overturned a semi-truck near Elmdale, causing an injury. Two EF2 tornadoes near Strong City caused major damage to outbuildings, silos, power poles, and trees, while an EF0 tornado caused minor tree damage in the northern part of town. An EF1 tornado caused minor to moderate damage as it moved through Cottonwood Falls, and another EF0 tornado injured a person in a vehicle near Saffordville. Three EFU tornadoes were also confirmed in Iowa.[101] Another round of severe weather occurred the next day from southern Wisconsin to South Texas, including three weak tornadoes in Illinois and Texas, and hail in Illinois up to 3.00 in (7.6 cm) wide.[102][103] Federal disaster assistance was requested in Oklahoma following the tornado outbreak.

An EF0 tornado in Mooresville, North Carolina, caused minor tree, fence, and house damage. Another EF0 tornado touched down in Poolesville, Maryland, where minor tree and structure damage occurred. The town of Womelsdorf, Pennsylvania, was struck by an EF1 tornado, which snapped trees and power poles, damaged a few structures and vehicles, and flipped a set of metal bleachers. The most significant tornado of the event was an EF2 tornado that produced its most intense damage in rural forested areas north of Jeffersonville, New York, where a metal truss transmission tower was collapsed, garages and barns were heavily damaged or destroyed, and many large hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. The tornado unroofed a couple of buildings in Roscoe and Rockland shortly before it dissipated. Two children were killed in Pennsylvania as a result of trees that were blown over by straight-line winds. The next day, a daily record of 3.13 in (80 mm) of rain fell in Hartford, Connecticut.[108] The rainfall total in Central Park was 2.14 in (54 mm).[109] A total of eight tornadoes were confirmed.[8][110]\nOn April 22, a tornado was caught on video by local residents as it struck Jalan Bani Bu Ali in Ash Sharqiyah South Governorate in eastern Oman. The tornado damaged many homes, killed farm animals, and injured a woman. The storm system that spawned the tornado also resulted in torrential rainfall and flash flooding. On the following day, Jalan Bani Bu Ali was hit by another tornado.[111][112]\nIn late April, a slow-moving weather system produced scattered tornadoes in the Southern and Eastern United States throughout a four-day period. On April 27, the Storm Prediction Center issued a slight risk of severe weather for the Gulf Coast region, including a 5% risk of tornadoes. A strong EF2 tornado struck the small town of Hosford, Florida, downing many trees and inflicting major damage to a few homes.

On April 29, the Storm Prediction Center issued a slight risk of severe weather for most of Florida and southeast Georgia, including a 5% risk area for tornadoes. A MCS off the coast of Florida produced damaging straight-line winds and heavy rain throughout the day. In Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, a high-end EF2 tornado a partially unroofed an apartment building, largely destroyed a manufactured home, heavily damaged a dry-cleaning business, and downed many trees and large metal light poles. Along US 1, the tornado was caught on video as it flipped and tossed cars. During the early morning hours of April 30, a high-end EF1 tornado destroyed a metal storage building in rural Charlotte County, Florida. Later in the afternoon, clusters of severe storms affected South Carolina, eastern North Carolina and the Hampton Roads area in Virginia. One embedded supercell made its way into the northern sections of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and produced an intense EF3 tornado that touched down in residential areas of the city, snapping or uprooting trees, overturning vehicles, and causing significant structural damage. Multiple large and well-built homes had their roofs torn off and suffered collapse of their top floor exterior walls. The tornado then struck Fort Story, where buildings sustained less intense damage before the tornado moved out into the Atlantic Ocean. Numerous videos and photographs taken by Virginia Beach residents showed a \"stovepipe\" tornado with an audible roar. In addition to tornadoes, flash flooding affected the entire East Coast on April 30.[113] A total of 12 tornadoes were confirmed.[8]\nAn F2 rated tornado struck Sultan Alaaddin, Akarca and \u00d6ren districts of the city of Anamur. Around 100 greenhouses were damaged along with windows and roofs of some houses and workplaces. Thirteen people were slightly injured.[116]\nEarly on May 6, a line of severe storms pushed through southern Louisiana, producing damaging winds. One low-end EF1 tornado near Morse damaged several homes, destroyed outbuildings, and injured one person.[117] Later that day, a severe weather outbreak impacted the Central United States. Multiple brief landspouts touched down in Nebraska and South Dakota but no damage occurred. Tornadoes also touched down in Minnesota, including some that caused some damage. In Missouri, a lone supercell thunderstorm produced multiple tornadoes, including one high-end EF0 tornado that damaged the roofs of several homes and a church in Trenton, as well as a high-end EF2 tornado north of Linneus that damaged or destroyed several homes and outbuildings. The next morning, an EF1 tornado struck the Indiana University Southeast campus near New Albany, Indiana, injuring two people.[8][118] An Eras Tour concert in Nashville was delayed multiple hours due to severe storms in the area.[119] Damage from the tornado outbreak totaled $1.1 billion.[79]\nA grain bin that was destroyed northwest of Oakland, Nebraska by an EF2 tornado.\nBetween May 10 and May 13, a tornado outbreak affected the Great Plains. Over two dozen tornado reports from the Great Plains and Gulf Coast came into the Storm Prediction Center on May 11, although all the tornadoes that touched down were either weak or not ratable.[120] The storm system also resulted in Denver recording their 8th wettest day on record,[121] with hail forcing a ground stop at Denver International Airport.[122]Amtrak's northbound Heartland Flyer was delayed for almost three hours that day due severe warnings north of its station stop in Purcell, Oklahoma, including one warning for an EF1 tornado that struck Noble just southeast of Norman.[123] A large tornado outbreak affected Nebraska the next day. Numerous tornadoes touched down, including a multi-vortex EF1 tornado near Spalding that was captured on video by multiple storm chasers. A large rain wrapped EF2 tornado was also spotted near Uehling with two injuries and widespread damage being reported from the storm. Other tornado touchdowns were also reported near Oakland and Lyons[124][125][126] and other tornadoes were reported in Kansas and Oklahoma as well.[126] Early the next morning on May 13, a high-end EF1 tornado struck Laguna Heights, Texas, where emergency management confirmed one fatality and multiple injuries as well as extensive property damage.[127][128] More tornadoes touched down later that afternoon across Iowa and Illinois.[129][130] Damage occurred near Harvey, Pomeroy, and Knoxville, Iowa.

Damage from the tornado outbreak totaled $2.4 billion.[79]\nMultiple rounds of severe and tornadic thunderstorms impacted a large portion of the South, Midwest, and Great Plains in the middle of June. On June 14, multiple severe thunderstorm watches and tornado watches were issued from the Ark-La-Tex region to northern Florida.[138] A large EF2 tornado moved between Blakely and Arlington, Georgia, knocking down power lines and trees and severely damaging a home, injuring the residents inside.[139] More tornadoes were reported later that afternoon and evening across Alabama and Georgia while an EF2 tornado caused major damage in Cass County, Texas.[140] There were also over 300 reports of large hail and damaging winds, including wind gusts reaching as high as 82 mph (132 km/h) and hail up to 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter in Mississippi.[141] On June 15, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for severe weather across much of Oklahoma, along with a small part of Texas and Kansas. The risk was driven by 45% hatched areas for both large hail and damaging winds. A small 10% area for tornadoes covering the eastern part of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles as well as all of Southwestern Oklahoma was also present.[142] That afternoon, multiple rounds of intense supercells formed across this region and pushed eastward. One of the cells produced a destructive and deadly low-end EF3 tornado that tracked through Perryton, Texas, causing significant damage to a mobile home park and destroying multiple downtown and industrial buildings, killing at least three people, and injuring about 100 others.[143][144] Other tornadoes were confirmed in Oklahoma and Texas along with swath of wind and hail damage. Supercell thunderstorms also developed along the western part of Lake Erie and moved southeastward, spawning several tornadoes, including three that were rated EF2. One of these tornadoes caused considerable damage in the Point Place neighborhood in Toledo, Ohio.[145] Severe weather also continued to impact the Gulf Coast and Southeastern United States into the early morning hours of June 16, where many instances of damaging winds and large hail were reported along with isolated tornadoes.[146] Flash flooding in Pensacola, Florida, resulted from 9.23 in (234 mm) of rain in five hours, and strong winds blew a tree into a house, killing one person. The flooding triggered a flash flood emergency.[147] A couple of weak tornadoes touched down in the Delaware Valley while more weak tornadoes touched down in Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Virginia. By June 16, the storms had left 664,000 customers without power along the Gulf Coast.[148]\nMore rounds of severe storms occurred on June 17, including a powerful MCS that pushed through Northern and Central Oklahoma. Both the Oklahoma City and Tulsa metropolitan areas had widespread wind damage with the latter metropolitan area seeing wind gusts of up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) and multiple weak tornadoes. On June 18, more tornadoes were confirmed in Florida and Mississippi, including an EF3 tornado which caused significant damage in Louin, Mississippi, where at least one fatality and 20 injuries occurred.[149][150] Scattered tornadoes occurred across the Southeast on June 19 as well, including an EF2 tornado that injured six people in Moss Point, Mississippi. Overall, 87 tornadoes were confirmed during this outbreak sequence.[151]\nA violent EF4 tornado, estimated at 620 m (680 yd) wide, struck Mountain View County, Alberta, Canada, at 1:45 p.m. MDT (19:45 UTC). Areas between Didsbury and Carstairs were hit hardest before the tornado crossed Highway 2. Three homes were destroyed, four were rendered uninhabitable, and five were damaged.[160] One person was injured by debris while sheltering in the basement of her collapsing home, but no fatalities occurred. Tree branches were snapped, power lines were downed, and one gas leak occurred at a destroyed home. Twenty-five cows, twenty chickens, and one horse were also killed.[161] Significant ground scouring occurred near Didsbury.[162] The joint damage survey from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), Prairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Centre (PASPC), and the Northern Tornadoes Project (NTP) assigned a maximum rating of low-end EF4 based on one well-built home being completely destroyed, with peak wind speeds estimated at 275 km/h (171 mph). Near this home, a 22,000 lb (10,000 kg) combine was thrown 50 m (160 ft) before being rolled a further 50 to 100 m (160 to 330 ft). This was only the third violent tornado in Alberta history, after the 1987 Edmonton tornado and the 1915 Grassy Lake tornado (also known as the Redcliff Cyclone).[160]\nA long-tracked storm struck Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, causing severe damage along a path of about 112 kilometres (70 mi). The storm produced at least one tornado, most likely a tornado family during this long track. At least EF2 vegetation damage was documented, with the most severe damage noted in the town of Sede Nova, which was struck by a tornado.[163]\nA high-end EF1 tornado touched down in Aguada, Puerto Rico, partially tearing the roof off of one home causing significant interior damage. Another home lost its roof covering material and metal siding. Numerous trees were uprooted and snapped. Peak wind speeds were estimated at 110 mph (180 km/h).[172]\nRadar scan of the storm as it produced the Dortches tornado: a hook echo is visible on the top left, and a debris signature on the bottom left\nAn intense multiple-vortex tornado touched down southwest of Dortches, North Carolina, leaving power poles bent and trees snapped. The tornado then crossed I-95, producing widespread tree damage and shutting down parts of the highway for several hours.[174] As it moved into the city limits of Dortches itself, it strengthened to high-end EF2 intensity, destroying multiple single-wide mobile homes and snapping power poles. The tornado then reached the north side of Rocky Mount after continuing to travel east-northeast, in which it encountered a residential building and collapsed every exterior wall. The tornado later advanced into Belmont Lake Golf Club, where it strengthened to mid-range EF3 intensity. The tornado collapsed a metal transmission tower and caused significant damage to a Pfizer warehouse facility, flipping and destroying nearby semi-trailer trucks. The tornado then weakened slightly as it crossed into Edgecombe County before lifting east of Battleboro.[175]\nThe tornado's peak estimated wind speeds were 150 mph (240 km/h), with a peak width of 600 yards (550 m) and a total path length of 16.5 miles (26.6 km).[175] It caused sixteen injuries, two of them resulting in hospitalization, but no fatalities. 38 homes were damaged. The National Weather Service office in Raleigh did not issue a tornado warning for the storm until the tornado had already been down for six minutes, resulting in scrutiny from some meteorologists on social media, but the National Weather Service defended the warning process and noted that the eventual warning came before the tornado dealt its most significant damage.[176] After law enforcement reported that up to 50,000 pallets of medicine had been damaged at the Pfizer facility, Erin Fox of the University of Utah Health said the damage could lead to shortages of certain drugs while the company deals with the situation.[177]FDA Commissioner Robert Califf later announced that, since hospitals already had the drugs or the drugs were on their way, no significant supply impacts were expected. Pfizer said as the tornado had damaged storage areas but not production equipment, any shortages would be less serious.[178] The tornado caused over $300 million (2023 USD) in damage.[179]\nA strong tornado tracked 14 km in and around Alfonsine, Emilia Romagna, injuring 14 people. Steel power trusses were bent at the base, cars and trucks were moved, heavy damage occurred to crops of various types, trees were snapped or uprooted, objects were lofted for hundreds of meters, and some buildings (partially) collapsed. The tornado was rated IF3 on the International Fujita scale by the European Severe Storms Laboratory.[180]\nA rare tornado touched down in Ilirska Bistrica, Slovenia, damaging houses and felling trees. The tornado, which was rated F1/T3, was associated with an isolated supercell storm. Tornadoes are exceedingly rare in Slovenia and neighboring countries except for Italy. The nearest official weather station, Koseze, reported 107 km/h (30 m/s; 66 mph) winds some distance from the tornado's path.[181] Another tornado had occurred earlier near Jesolo, Italy.[182] The region had been the site of uncommonly severe storm systems throughout June and July 2023.\nA deadly EF2 tornado struck parts of Yancheng City, Jiangsu. Approximately 283 residences were damaged or destroyed, two people were reported to have been killed, and at least 15 people were injured.[188][189][190]\nThe tornado debris signature from the Webberville, Michigan EF2 tornado, which extended to about 25,000 feet (7,600 m) in height.\nA severe weather and tornado outbreak occurred across parts of the Great Lakes region and southwestern Ontario during the evening hours of August 24, including in the Grand Rapids and Webberville, Michigan areas, as well as in Metro Detroit. Near Webberville, an EF2 tornado prompted a PDS tornado warning, flipping cars and trapping people in their vehicles on I-96, resulting in one fatality and three injuries.[195][196] Roofs and buildings collapsed across Kent County due to a high-end EF1 tornado that moved through portions of the county.[197] An EF2 tornado also struck Fayette County, Pennsylvania early on August 25 as well.[198] In Ontario, two tornadoes occurred simultaneously and moved southeastward in the Windsor area.[199] The first one was an EF0 tornado that moved through the west side of Windsor, downing numerous trees and branches, removing roof shingles from homes, and damaging fences.[200] To the east, an EF1 tornado collapsed barns, snapped power poles, damaged grain bins, downed trees and branches down, and removed roof shingles from numerous homes as it passed east of Tecumseh and struck Elmstead before dissipating northeast of Pleasant Park.[201] Severe flooding and damaging winds also affected much of the region and three deaths occurred after a weather-related vehicle accident.[195] Another person was killed in Michigan when a tree fell on a home in Lansing.[202] The storms also resulted in over 700,000 customers losing power in the Great Lakes area,[203] while another 20,000 customers lost power in Ontario.[199] Between the two nations, estimated economic losses reached $880 million.[204]\nOn September 17, three tornadoes impacted France and the United Kingdom. A brief landspout struck S\u00e9reilhac in R\u00e9gion Limousin. [205] Around the same time, a significant tornado struck in Mayenne, France, causing damage to or destroying structures, trees, and concrete utility poles were bent. The French Observatory of Tornadoes and Violent Thunderstorms (Keraunos) rated the tornado EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds estimated between 175 to 225 kilometres per hour (109 to 140 mph).[206] The European Severe Storms Laboratory rated the tornado IF2 on the International Fujita scale. In the late evening, a waterspout made landfall on West Beach before tracking through the western and northern suburbs of Littlehampton and then the communities of Wick and Lyminster. This tornado toppled several trees, smashing at least 20 car windows and those of multiple houses. One person sustained minor leg injuries. On September 18, the Met Office noted that \"conditions weren't unfavourable\" for a small tornado.[207][208] On September 19, a TORRO site investigator confirmed the event as a tornado. A preliminary analysis suggested the majority of the damage warranted a T1 rating, with a peak of T2.[209]\nA significant tornado impacted the community of Gr\u00f8nh\u00f8j Strand in Jammerbugt Municipality. The tornado picked up a mobile home and threw it 20 metres. Other mobile homes and caravans were overturned or moved and a shed was destroyed. According to the ESSL, the tornado had a track length of 1.2 km, had a maximum path width of 100 metres, and had a maximum intensity of IF2.[210]\nTwo tornadoes moved directly into the city of Suqian, Jiangsu, killing five people and injuring another four.[211] Approximately 1,600 houses were either damaged or completely destroyed. Another tornado struck parts of Funing, Jiangsu, also causing five deaths and four minor injuries.[212] The two tornadoes in Suqian were rated EF2, while the tornado in Funing received an EF3 rating.[213][214]\nSevere thunderstorms spawned at least one tornado in western Germany, which affected the towns of Nusbaum and M\u00fclbach. Severe damage to roofs and trees was reported, and the tornado has been given a preliminary IF2 rating by the ESSL.[215]\nA strong tornado developed in southern Brazil, affecting the city of Cascavel, Paran\u00e1. Roofs and trees suffered significant damage and a building was completely destroyed. The tornado has been given a F2 rating by SIMEPAR.[216]\nA large storm system moved through Florida, spawning several tornadoes. In the early morning hours of October 12, a waterspout offshore of Clearwater Beach moved northeast and made landfall in Dunedin, partially tearing the roof off of an apartment building and earning a low-end EF2 rating. Soon after, another strong EF2 tornado moved through Crystal River, tearing the roof off of one home and collapsing an exterior wall. Later in the morning, another low-end EF2 tornado touched down in Palm Coast, unroofing one home and flipping a car. Four other EF0 tornadoes were also confirmed during this event.[8]\nFor the second time in just over a month, another tornado struck the town of Littlehampton. Several trees were snapped, fence panels were destroyed, power lines were brought down, car windows were smashed, and one house had its entire roof ripped off. On October 29, a TORRO site investigator visited the site where the event happened and confirmed that the weather event was a tornado. Additionally, they have provisionally rated the tornado T4 on the TORRO scale, which is equivalent to a low-end F2 tornado.[217] The European severe weather database rated the tornado IF2 on the International Fujita scale. [218]\nA significant tornado touched down in Jersey, United Kingdom, on the evening of November 1 into the morning of November 2. One house had its entire roof ripped off and upper story walls destroyed.[219][220] The tornado was rated IF2.5 by the European Severe Storms Laboratory on the new International Fujita scale (IF-scale).[221] On November 6, TORRO released a statement that rated the tornado T6 on the TORRO scale, which is equivalent to a low-end F3 tornado. [222] On the morning of November 2, another tornado was confirmed in Sompting and northern Lancing in West Sussex. According to TORRO after looking at the damage caused and reports from the public, the tornado\u2019s track was mapped and the tornado was rated a T2 on the TORRO scale. Later that same day, an IF1 rated tornado struck parts of Castel Focognano in Italy, damaging roofs and trees. On November 4, an intense tornado struck Lavino in Bulgaria. According to the European Severe Storms Laboratory, at least 150 structures were damaged and one person was slightly injured, earning a rating of IF3. About half an hour later, a significant tornado struck X\u00e1nthi, Greece. A large tree branch fell on a moving bus, causing no injuries. Length of the damage path reached at least 1.5 km (between Geor. Kondyli street and EPS stadiums). This tornado was rated IF2. [221] Additionally, an unrated tornado struck parts of Sratsimir, Bulgaria, an IF1.5 tornado struck parts of Derek\u00f6y, Turkey, and an IF1 tornado struck parts of La Pou\u00ebze, France.

        "effective_year": "2023",
        "context": "\nColleen Hoover (born Margaret Colleen Fennell; December 11, 1979) is an American author who primarily writes novels in the romance and young adult fiction genres.[2][1] She is best known for her 2016 romance novel It Ends with Us. Many of her works were self-published before being picked up by a publishing house.[2][3] As of October 2022, Hoover has sold approximately 20 million books.[4] She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2023.[5]\nIn November 2011, Hoover began writing her debut novel, Slammed, with no intention of getting published. She was inspired by a lyric, \"decide what to be and go be it,\u201d from an Avett Brothers song, \"Head Full of Doubt/Road Full of Promise,\" and she incorporated Avett Brothers lyrics throughout the story.[13] Hoover self-published Slammed in January 2012.[11] She states that she published the novel so her mother, who had just received an Amazon Kindle, could read it.[14] A sequel, Point of Retreat, was published in February 2012.[11] After a few months, Slammed was reviewed and given five stars by book blogger Maryse Black,[15] and afterward, sales rapidly rocketed for Hoover's first two books.[11][16]Slammed and Point of Retreat reached #8 and #18, respectively, on the New York Times Best Seller list in August of that year.[17][18]Atria Books picked up the novels and republished them on August 10, 2012.[19] A third book in the series, This Girl, was published in April 2013.[20][21] After the success of Slammed, Hoover quit her job in social work to become a full-time writer.[14]\nHoover's novel Hopeless was self-published in December 2012, and features a girl who was home-schooled throughout her elementary education before going to a public high school.[11] The book reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list on January 20,[2][3] and remained there for three weeks.[22] It was the first self-published novel to ever top the list.[23] A companion novel, Losing Hope, was published that July.[24]\nFinding Cinderella is a free novella that Hoover published in 2014. It features several of the characters depicted in her novels Hopeless and Losing Hope. A paperback was released with several bonus features, such as a new epilogue and Hoover's own \"Cinderella story\".[25]Maybe Someday, published in March 2014, was the first novel of a small series about a boy and a girl who write music together and fall in love. Musician Griffin Peterson created a soundtrack to accompany the novel.[26] Links in the e-book or a scannable QR code in the paperback led to a website where readers could listen to the music.[27]\nNever Never, a 2015 collaboration with Tarryn Fisher, was originally split into three parts and sold as three separate books. The work was later republished as one complete book.[citation needed]\nHoover's novel It Ends with Us was published in 2016.[28] Hoover described it as \"the hardest book I've ever written.\"[29] The novel concerns domestic violence, and, according to Hoover, it was written with the intention of advocating for domestic violence victims.[30] The story was inspired by Hoover's personal experience as a child growing up in a household with domestic violence, which carried through into her adult life. The book's main character, Lily, experiences domestic violence at a young age, witnessing her father's abuse towards her mother, on top of experiencing it firsthand, and then she ends up in a violent relationship as an adult.[31] As of 2019, the novel had sold over a million copies worldwide, and it has been translated into over twenty languages.[32] In 2021, Hoover experienced a surge in popularity due to attention from the #BookTok community on TikTok.[33][34] As a result, in January 2022, It Ends with Us was #1 on The New York Times Best Sellers list.[35] Filming of a movie adaptation of It Ends with Us began in May 2023.[36]\nA sequel to It Ends with Us, titled It Starts with Us, was published on October 18, 2022 by Atria Books.[37]Simon & Schuster released the details of the extensive marketing campaign for the novel, which became the publisher's most-preordered book of all time.[38]\nIn October 2022, Simon & Schuster UK acquired two standalone novels by Hoover, which are to be published in 2024 and 2026.[39]\nAs of October 2022, Hoover has sold more than 20 million books.[4] Reflecting on Hoover's success in 2022, Alexandra Alter of The New York Times wrote, \"To say she\u2019s currently the best-selling novelist in the United States, to even compare her to other successful authors who have landed several books on the best seller lists, fails to capture the size and loyalty of her audience.\"[4] Hoover's work has been criticized for normalizing abuse.[40]",

        "context": "\nThe International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is a mathematical olympiad for pre-university students, and is the oldest of the International Science Olympiads.[1] It is \u201cthe most prestigious\u201d mathematical competition in the world. The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. It has since been held annually, except in 1980. More than 100 countries participate. Each country sends a team of up to six students,[2] plus one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.[3]\nThe content ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems in branches of mathematics not conventionally covered in secondary or high school and often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations, combinatorics, and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, as there is a principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity, often times a great deal of ingenuity to net all points for a given IMO problem.\nThe selection process differs by country, but it often consists of a series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing test. Awards are given to approximately the top-scoring 50% of the individual contestants. Teams are not officially recognized\u2014all scores are given only to individual contestants, but team scoring is unofficially compared more than individual scores.[4] Contestants must be under the age of 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution. Subject to these conditions, an individual may participate any number of times in the IMO.[5]\nThe first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. Since then it has been held every year (except in 1980, when it was cancelled due to internal strife in Mongolia)[6] It was initially founded for eastern European member countries of the Warsaw Pact, under the USSR bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as well.[2] Because of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in eastern European countries, and gradually spread to other nations.[7]\nSources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders and students are generally housed at different locations, and partly because after the competition the students were sometimes based in multiple cities for the rest of the IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.[8]\nThe competition consists of 6 problems. The competition is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. Each problem is worth 7 points for a maximum total score of 42 points. Calculators are not allowed. The problems chosen are from various areas of secondary school mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often elementary. However, they are usually disguised so as to make the solutions difficult. The problems given in the IMO are largely designed to require creativity and the ability to solve problems quickly. Thus, the prominently featured problems are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years, the latter has not been as popular as before because of the algorithmic use of theorems like Muirhead's Inequality, and Complex/Analytic Bash to solve problems.[10]\nEach participating country, other than the host country, may submit suggested problems to a Problem Selection Committee provided by the host country, which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlist. The team leaders arrive at the IMO a few days in advance of the contestants and form the IMO Jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest, starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist. The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6, where the First day problems Q1, Q2, and Q3 are in increasing difficulty, and the Second day problems Q4, Q5, Q6 are in increasing difficulty. The Team Leaders of all countries are given the problems in advance of the contestants, and thus, are kept strictly separated and observed.[11]\nEach country's marks are agreed between that country's leader and deputy leader and coordinators provided by the host country (the leader of the team whose country submitted the problem in the case of the marks of the host country), subject to the decisions of the chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved.[12]\nIn countries of the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, a team has in the past been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries.[16]\nThe participants are ranked based on their individual scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly fewer than half of them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver, or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. Participants who do not win a medal but who score 7 points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention.[17]\nSpecial prizes may be awarded for solutions of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem. This last happened in 1995 (Nikolay Nikolov, Bulgaria) and 2005 (Iurie Boreico), but was more frequent up to the early 1980s.[18] The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico, a student from Moldova, for his solution to Problem 3, a three variable inequality.\nThe rule that at most half the contestants win a medal is sometimes broken if it would cause the total number of medals to deviate too much from half the number of contestants. This last happened in 2010 (when the choice was to give either 226 (43.71%) or 266 (51.45%) of the 517 contestants (excluding the 6 from North Korea \u2014 see below) a medal),[19] 2012 (when the choice was to give either 226 (41.24%) or 277 (50.55%) of the 548 contestants a medal), and 2013, when the choice was to give either 249 (47.16%) or 278 (52.65%) of the 528 contestants a medal. In these cases, slightly more than half the contestants were awarded a medal.[20][21]\nThe four perfect scorers in the 2001 IMO. From left to right: Gabriel Carroll, Reid Barton (both United States), Liang Xiao and Zhiqiang Zhang (both China).The Bangladesh team at the 2009 IMOSerbia's team for the 2010 IMOZhuo Qun (Alex) Song (Canadian), the most highly decorated IMO contestant with 5 golds and 1 bronze medalMaryam Mirzakhani (Iran), the first woman to be honored with a Fields Medal, won 2 gold medals in 1994 and 1995, getting a perfect score in the second year.\nThe only countries to have their entire team score perfectly in the IMO were the United States in 1994 (they were coached by Paul Zeitz), China in 2022, and Luxembourg, whose 1-member team had a perfect score in 1981. The US's success earned a mention in TIME Magazine.[80] Hungary won IMO 1975 in an unorthodox way when none of the eight team members received a gold medal (five silver, three bronze).[72] Second place team East Germany also did not have a single gold medal winner (four silver, four bronze).[78]\nSeveral individuals have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: Zhuo Qun Song (Canada) is the most highly decorated participant[81] with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal.[82]Reid Barton (United States) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998\u20132001).[83] Barton is also one of only eight four-time Putnam Fellows (2001\u201304). Christian Reiher (Germany), Lisa Sauermann (Germany), Teodor von Burg (Serbia), Nipun Pitimanaaree (Thailand) and Luke Robitaille (United States) are the only other participants to have won four gold medals (2000\u201303, 2008\u201311, 2009\u201312, 2010\u201313, 2011\u201314, and 2019\u201322 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009).[84] Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin H\u00e4rterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold.[2]Ciprian Manolescu (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than anybody else in the history of the competition, doing it all three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997).[85] Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000).[86]Eugenia Malinnikova (Soviet Union) is the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history. She has 3 gold medals in IMO 1989 (41 points), IMO 1990 (42) and IMO 1991 (42), missing only 1 point in 1989 to precede Manolescu's achievement.[87]\nTerence Tao (Australia) participated in IMO 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning bronze, silver and gold medals respectively. He won a gold medal when he just turned thirteen in IMO 1988, becoming the youngest person[88] to receive a gold medal (Zhuo Qun Song of Canada also won a gold medal at age 13, in 2011, though he was older than Tao). Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist with his 1986 bronze medal, followed by 2009 bronze medalist Ra\u00fal Ch\u00e1vez Sarmiento (Peru), at the age of 10 and 11 respectively.[89] Representing the United States, Noam Elkies won a gold medal with a perfect paper at the age of 14 in 1981. Both Elkies and Tao could have participated in the IMO multiple times following their success, but entered university and therefore became ineligible.\nOver the years, since its inception to present, the IMO has attracted far more male contestants than female contestants.[91][92][93] During the period 2000\u20132021, there were only 1,102 female contestants (9.2%) out of a total of 11,950 contestants. The gap is even more significant in terms of IMO gold medallists; from 1959 to 2021, there were 43 female and 1295 male gold medal winners.[94]\n^IMO 2021 was originally to be held in Washington D.C., US, but the US was forced to give up hosting soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused funding problems. Russia agreed to host for the second time in a row.[60]",

Based on the original The Voice of Holland and part of the Voice franchise, it has aired 23 seasons and aims to find unsigned singing talent (solo or duets, professional and amateur) contested by aspiring singers drawn from public auditions. Singers must be at least thirteen years of age to compete.[2]\nEach season begins with the \"Blind Auditions\", where coaches form their team of artists whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The number of artists varies per season, with a set range between 8 and 16 artists. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read \"I want you.\" At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects their coach if more than one coach expresses interest.[6] Introduced in the 14th season is \"Block\", which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestant.\nIn the \"Battle Rounds\", each coach pairs two of their team members to perform together, then chooses one to advance in the competition. Each coach are assisted by different celebrity advisors varies each season. In season one, coaches sit alongside their respective advisors in the battle stage; however, the advisors no longer join the coaches in the battle stage starting season two. In season 23, there are no advisors and its coach assumed the duties for advising the artists alone. Season three introduced \"steals\", allowing each coach to save/select individuals who were eliminated during a battle round by another coach. First seen in the eighth season, artists are either given a walkover or is reassigned to a three-way battle in the event of another artist withdrawing from the competition if each coach sees fit. Saves were also added starting Season 14, which lets a coach prevent someone that they eliminated on their team from going home; in Season 23, Saves are replaced with \"Playoff Pass\" (based on the Battle Pass from the Australian version) which allow one artist to exempt them from participating in the Knockouts and directly advance to the Playoffs (the other artist advancing to the Knockouts as usual).\nThe Knockout Rounds were also introduced in season three (except for seasons six and sixteen). A pair of artists within a team are selected to sing individual performances in succession. They are not told until a few minutes prior to their performances who their partner is. The artists get to choose their own songs in this round, although they continue to get help and advice from their respective coaches, and since season six, a celebrity advisor serving as a mega mentor (except seasons 14 and 22). At the conclusion of the performances, coaches would decide which one of each pair gets to advance to the next round.[6] Similar to the battle rounds, the coaches can steal one eliminated artist from another coach starting with season five. Starting in season 14, coaches can save one eliminated artist from their own team. From season 18 till 20, artists who were saved faced a Four-Way Knockout, with the winner decided through a public vote.[7]\nThe \"Battles, Round 2\" were introduced to replace the Knockout Rounds in season six.[6] Similar to the Knockout Rounds, each singer is paired within their team. One celebrity key adviser also assists all four of the coaches and their teams in preparation of these rounds. Coaches give each Battle pairing a list of songs and each pair must agree on which song to sing.[8] Like the first Battle round, each coach can still decide which of their singers in each pair will advance to the next round, and also allowed one steal.[9]\nIn the sixteenth season, the knockouts were replaced by The Live Cross Battles, a format identical to the Cross Battles from the Chinese version of The Voice. Each coach selects an artist to perform with another coach's artist together. The artist that receives the public vote will move on to the Playoffs, while the losing artist may be eliminated from the competition. The Live Cross Battles did not return in season seventeen due to poor reception.[10]\nPreviously eliminated artists can also advance to compete in the live shows; between seasons nine and thirteen (except season 11), each coach saved one artist (from either the Battle or Knockout rounds) to put through to the Live Playoffs. For seasons 15, 16 and 20, selected singers (prior to the Live elimination rounds) are put through to the \"Comeback Stage\" (which would be mentored by a fifth coach) and competed in a series of duels for a place in the live shows, with the winner earning a right to join a team of their choice. Season 21 added \"Voice Comeback\" where each coach picked one artist to compete in a Twitter poll, and only one artist with the most votes moves on.\nIn the final live performance phase of the competition (playoffs and elimination rounds), artists perform in weekly shows, where public voting narrows to a final group of artists and eventually declares a winner.[6]\nUnder the current format since season three in favor on a more competitive standard previously seen on other similar reality shows, any artists, regardless of each team, who earned the lowest number of votes were progressively eliminated each week until five artists remain (three until season 6, then four prior to season 17), hence introducing a possibility where at least one coach would not represent a single artist in the finale.\nPrior to season three, the coaches have the power to save one artist that had not received the public's vote that week, and as of season two, \"last chance performance\" are added where artists performed an additional song to vie for their coach's save, or other twists employed such as \"instant elimination\", where an artist faced immediate elimination without going through a public vote. However, in deciding who moves on to the final four phase, the television audience and the coaches have equal say. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale, where the outcome is decided solely by public vote. Season 18-20 temporarily reverted this format allowing each coach to guarantee at least one artist advancing in the finale to accommodate the short number of live shows at three weeks,[11] but these changes were reversed on Season 21 by reverting to the regular elimination format while retaining the top five finalists.[12]\nIn a first for a music competition series, NBC and Universal Republic Records offered fans of the show the ability to vote for their favorite artists by purchasing the studio versions of the songs that they perform on the live show each week via the iTunes Store. Alternative methods of voting can be done through toll-free phone calls (until season 8), text messaging, \"The Voice Official App on NBC\" app, and online votes via NBC.com and Facebook. Each method is limited to ten votes per user, and voting lasts until noon EST the next day.\nFrom the top 12 results show of season 3 to the end of season 17, a rule regarding voting was enacted with regard to iTunes singles purchases. In the first two seasons, voting via iTunes purchases of contestant performances counted singly during the official voting window and only accredited to the live show in concern. When a competitor's performance peaked within the Top 10 of the iTunes \"Top 200 Singles Chart\" during this window, it was given an iTunes bonus that multiplies iTunes votes made by ten. In season 5, the iTunes bonus multiplier was reduced to five for the studio versions of the songs performed by the competitors. The finale's vote count included a 'Cumulative iTunes Vote Total' of all singles (from the live shows onwards) purchased during and outside of the various voting windows, with iTunes bonuses previously earned.[13] Between seasons 15 and 17, the bonus multiplier was revised to include streams counting as a vote, and the only artist with the most streams after the voting window ended would receive the bonus.[14] The iTunes bonus multiplier was discontinued beginning with the live shows of season 18, as the performances are now recorded away from the studios and could not be recorded to iTunes or Spotify; this measure was initially enacted for safety reasons as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.[15] In season 19, studio performances are now recorded on YouTube Music, replacing the traditional iTunes and Spotify recordings that were done between the seasons 2\u201317, but this was changed back beginning season 20, though bonuses do not apply regardless if the song charted within the top 10 or not. Season 22 was the first season to not have any studio performances released on any platform overall.\nOnly the studio recording of the contestants' performances, not the live performance, were available on iTunes. In the first season, the battle rounds were recorded in the studio with both artists in the pairing. However, from season 2 to season 18, only the winner's version of the song from the battle round was released. Season 7 reverted to the old style of both artists. With the introduction of the Knockout Rounds in season three, where each contestant sang a separate song, only the winner's single was released.\nThe \"Instant Save\" was introduced in season five. During the live elimination episodes, viewers are given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants at risk of elimination by using their Twitter account (and since season 17, the official app) to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 13. Home viewers can only vote once per account for one contestant of their choice. Since season six, the instant saves now function as a last-chance performance where artists perform an additional song to rally votes.\nCeeLo Green of Gnarls Barkley and Adam Levine of Maroon 5 became the first confirmed coaches in February 2011,[16] followed by Christina Aguilera[17] and Blake Shelton in March.[18] Aguilera and Green did not return for season four and were replaced by Shakira and Usher.[19] Aguilera and Green then returned for season five, while Shakira and Usher returned for season six.[20][21] In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in February 2014, Green revealed that he would not be returning to The Voice.[22] On March 31, 2014, it was announced that Pharrell Williams would become Green's replacement.[23] On April 19, 2014, it was announced that No Doubt's Gwen Stefani would replace Aguilera in season seven due to her pregnancy.[citation needed] On May 20, 2014, Shakira and Usher confirmed that after season six, they would focus on their music.[24][25] On March 25, 2016, Miley Cyrus confirmed that following her role as key advisor during the tenth season that she would be joining the series once again in its eleventh season as a coach.[26] That same day, Alicia Keys was also announced to be joining the series as a coach for the eleventh season.[27] On October 18, 2016, it was announced that Stefani would re-join the coaches' panel for the series' twelfth season, alongside returning coaches Keys, Levine and Shelton; it was also confirmed that Cyrus would return for the thirteenth season.[28]\nOn April 27, 2017, in an interview published by TV Insider, Keys confirmed that the twelfth season would be her last.

Previously in 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that The Voice \"is most popular in North Dakota and least popular in New York. It was behind only Duck Dynasty and Fast N' Loud in its correlation with Trump voters\".[57]\nThe first season premiered strong at 11.78 million viewers and actually grew upon that audience through its first season. In the 18\u201349 demographic, the show constantly found itself in the top 5. For its average season rating, the show landed itself as no. 20 with total viewers at nearly 12 million viewers. In the 18\u201349 rankings, the show was no. 4 at a 5.4 ranking.\nThe second season premiered on Super Bowl Sunday, February 5, 2012, and for a while managed to keep a 6.0 in the adults 18\u201349 demographic and 17 million viewers. Partnering The Voice with Smash (NBC's musical drama) helped NBC win the Monday night ratings. However, by Monday, April 9, the ratings had fallen to a 4.0 rating in the adult 18\u201349 demographic.\nThe third season premiered on Monday, September 10, 2012, to 12.28 million viewers and a 4.2 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic and has since then grown to a season-high 4.8 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic on October 8, October 15 and 29, 2012 and a 4.9 rating in the finale. The Voice, along with NBC's new drama, Revolution has once again led NBC to win every Monday night of the season so far, just like it did last season. On Tuesdays, comedies Go On and The New Normal has been successful thanks to The Voice, leading NBC to be the only network of the Big 5 to grow in ratings from last season.\nEach U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\nThe Voice: I Want You is a video game based on the television show. It was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Wii U on October 21, 2014, and was published by Activision. The game includes a microphone and has songs from the show including songs performed by the coaches.\nThe Voice is broadcast on the NBC network in the United States. The show premiered in Canada on April 26, 2011, on CTV. In Asia, the series began airing on August 21, 2011, on AXN and was transferred to Star World (now Fox Life) starting in Season 11 until cessation of transmission on October 1, 2021.[117] It premiered in New Zealand on July 16, 2011, on TV2, in Australia on August 9, 2011, on Go!, in South Africa on October 5, 2011, on SABC 3, and on March 31, 2012, in the Philippines on Studio 23 (now S+A).[118] On May 22, 2019, it premiered in Germany on sixx starting Season 14.[119]",

        "context": "\nDuring the 19th century, women's peace groups in the United States tried establishing holidays and regular activities in favor of peace and against war. A common early activity was the meeting of groups of mothers whose sons had fought or died on opposite sides of the American Civil War.[3]\nIn 1868, Ann Jarvis, Anna Jarvis's mother, organized a committee to establish a \"Mother's Friendship Day\", the purpose of which was \"to reunite families that had been divided during the Civil War.\" Ann Jarvis, who had previously organized Mother's Day Work Clubs to improve sanitation and health for both Union and Confederate encampments undergoing a typhoid outbreak, wanted to expand these into an annual memorial for mothers, but she died in 1905 before the annual celebration was established.[4][5] Her daughter, who became almost obsessed with her, would continue her mother's efforts.\nThere were several limited observances in the 1870s and the 1880s. Still, none achieved resonance beyond the local level.[4] At the time, Protestant schools in the United States already held many celebrations and observations such as Children's Day, Temperance Sunday, Roll Call Day, Decision Day, Missionary Day and others.[6] In New York City, Julia Ward Howe led a \"Mother's Day for Peace\" anti-war observance on June 2, 1872,[4][6][7] which was accompanied by an \"Appeal to womanhood throughout the world\" (nowadays known as Mother's Day Proclamation). The observance continued in Boston for about ten years under Howe's sponsorship, then died out.[8] In these celebrations, mothers all around the world would work towards world peace.[6]\nSeveral years later, a Mother's Day observance on May 13, 1877, was held in Albion, Michigan over a dispute related to the temperance movement.[9] According to local legend, Albion pioneer Juliet Calhoun Blakeley stepped up to complete the sermon of the Rev. Myron Daughterty who was distraught because an anti-temperance group had forced his son and two other temperance advocates at gunpoint to spend the night in a saloon and become publicly drunk. From the pulpit, Blakeley called on other mothers to join her. Blakeley's two sons, both traveling salesmen, were so moved that they vowed to return each year to pay tribute to her and embarked on a campaign to urge their business contacts to do likewise. At their urging, in the early 1880s, the Methodist Episcopal Church in Albion set aside the second Sunday in May to recognize the special contributions of mothers.[citation needed]\nFrank E. Hering, alumnus and administrator at the University of Notre Dame and President of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, made a plea for \"setting aside one day in the year as a nationwide memorial to the memories of Mothers and motherhood\" in 1904.[10][11] After observing a class of Notre Dame students sending home penny postcards to their mothers, Hering went on to be a vocal advocate for a national Mother's Day for the next decade.[10] As Hering stated in a 1941 issue of Scholastic: \"Throughout history the great men of the world have given their credit for their achievements to their mothers. [The] Holy Church recognizes this, as does Notre Dame especially, and Our Lady who watches over our great institution.\"[10]\nMother's Day Historical Marker at Market and N. Juniper Sts. Philadelphia PAPresident Wilson's Mother's Day Proclamation of May 9, 1914\nIn its present form, Mother's Day was established by Anna Jarvis with the help of Philadelphia merchant John Wanamaker following the death of her mother, Ann Jarvis, on May 9, 1905. Jarvis never mentioned Howe or Mothering Sunday, and she never mentioned any connection to the Protestant school celebrations, always claiming that the creation of Mother's Day was hers alone.[12]\nJarvis then campaigned to establish Mother's Day first as a U.S. national holiday and then later as an international holiday.[14] The holiday was declared officially by the state of West Virginia in 1910, and the rest of the states followed quickly.[4]\nOn May 10, 1913, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on all federal government officials (from the president down) to wear a white carnation the following day in observance of Mother's Day.[15] On May 8, 1914, the U.S. Congress passed a law designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day and requesting a proclamation. The next day, President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation declaring the first national Mother's Day[16][17] as a day for American citizens to show the flag in honor of those mothers whose sons had died in war.[16] In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a stamp commemorating the holiday.[18]\nIn 1912 Anna Jarvis trademarked the phrases \"Second Sunday in May\" and \"Mother's Day\", and created the Mother's Day International Association.[22] She specifically noted that \"Mother's\" should \"be a singular possessive, for each family to honor its own mother, not a plural possessive commemorating all mothers in the world.\"[23] This is also the spelling used by President Woodrow Wilson in his 1914 presidential proclamation, by the Congress in relevant bills,[19][20] and by various presidents in their proclamations concerning Mother's Day.[24]\nTraditions on Mother's Day include churchgoing, the distribution of carnations, and family dinners.[1] Mother's Day is the third largest holiday in the United States for sending cards. According to the greeting card industry, it is estimated that more than 50 percent of American households send greeting cards on this holiday. The holiday has been heavily commercialized by advertisers and retailers, and has been criticized by some as a Hallmark Holiday.[25][26]\nCarnations have come to represent Mother's Day since Anna Jarvis delivered 500 at the first celebration in 1908.[4][17][21] Many religious services held later adopted the custom of giving away carnations.[4] This also started the custom of wearing a carnation on Mother's Day. The founder, Anna Jarvis, chose the carnation because it was her mother's favorite flower.[27] In part due to the shortage of white carnations, and in part due to the efforts to expand the sales of more types of flowers in Mother's Day, florists invented the idea of wearing a pink carnation if your mother was living, or a white one if she was dead; this was tirelessly promoted until it made its way into the popular observations at churches.[28] Other less traditional flower options may include roses, a live blooming plant, flower leis, or a bouquet of a variety of different flowers.\nThe commercialization of U.S. holidays began very early. Only nine years after the first official Mother's Day, it had become so rampant that Anna Jarvis herself became a prominent opponent of what the holiday had become,[23][29] spending all her inheritance and the rest of her life fighting what she saw as an abuse of the celebration.[23] She decried the practice of purchasing greeting cards, which she saw as a sign of being too lazy to write a personal letter. She was arrested in 1948 for disturbing the peace while protesting against the commercialization of Mother's Day, and she finally said that she \"...wished she would have never started the day because it became so out of control ...\"[29] She died later that year.\nMother's Day is now one of the most commercially successful American occasions, having become the most popular day of the year to dine out at a restaurant in the United States[30] and generating a significant portion of the U.S. jewelry industry's annual revenue, from custom gifts like mother's rings.[31] Americans spend approximately $2.6 billion on flowers, $1.53 billion on pampering gifts\u2014like spa treatments\u2014and another $68 million on greeting cards.[32]\nIt has been suggested that commercialization has ensured that the holiday has continued. In contrast, other holidays from the same time, such as Children's Day and Temperance Sunday,[33] are no longer celebrated.[34]\nFrom 2007\u20132018, The Players Championship men's golf tournament was held on Mother's Day weekend, except in 2011 and 2014 when May 1 fell on a Sunday. In those cases, it was held the following weekend. Previously, the Kingsmill Championship women's golf tournament was played on Mother's Day weekend from 2004 to 2009.\nProfessional sports players often wear pink clothing accessories on Mother's Day weekend.\n^O'Reilly, Andrea (April 6, 2010). Encyclopedia of Motherhood. Sage Publications (CA). p. 602. ISBN978-1-4522-6629-9. She organized the first official Mother's Day service at Andrews Methodist Church in Grafton, West Virginia, on the morning of May 10, 1908. That same afternoon, 15,000 people attended a Mother's Day service at the Wanamaker Store Auditorium in Philadelphia, which she also organized. Jarvis chose the second Sunday in May for Mother's Day to mark the anniversary of her mother's death and selected her mother's favorite flower, the white carnation, as the day's official emblem.\n^The First Anniversary of 'Mother's Day'\", The New York Times, June 3, 1874, p. 8: \"'Mother's Day,' which was inaugurated in this city on the 2nd of June, 1872, by Mrs. Julia Ward Howards[sic], was celebrated last night at Plimpton Hall by a mother's peace meeting...\"\n^ abRice, Susan Tracey and Robert Haven Schauffler (1915).

        "context": "\nFather's Day is an annual holiday honoring people's fathers and celebrating the fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society. It was first proposed by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, in 1909.[1] It is currently celebrated in the United States annually on the third Sunday in June.[2]\nFather's Day was inaugurated in the United States in the early 20th century to complement Mother's Day in celebrating fathers, fathering, and fatherhood.\nFather's Day was founded in Spokane, Washington, at the YMCA in 1910 by Sonora Smart Dodd, who was born in Arkansas.[3] Its first celebration was in the Spokane YMCA on June 19, 1910.[3][4] Her father, the Civil War veteran William Jackson Smart, was a single parent who raised his six children there.[3] After hearing a sermon about Anna Jarvis's Mother's Day at Central Methodist Episcopal Church in 1909, she told her pastor that fathers should have a similar holiday honoring them.[3][5] Although she initially suggested June 5, her father's birthday, the pastors of the Spokane Ministerial Alliance did not have enough time to prepare their sermons, and the celebration was deferred to the third Sunday of June.[6][7]\nIt did not have much success initially. In the 1920s, Dodd stopped promoting the celebration because she was studying at the Art Institute of Chicago, and it faded into relative obscurity, even in Spokane.[8] In the 1930s, Dodd returned to Spokane and started promoting the celebration again, raising awareness at a national level.[9] She had the help of those trade groups that would benefit most from the holiday, for example the manufacturers of ties, tobacco pipes, and any traditional present to fathers.[10] Since 1938, she had the help of the Father's Day Council, founded by the New York Associated Men's Wear Retailers to consolidate and systematize the commercial promotion.[11] Americans resisted the holiday at first, perceiving it as just an attempt by merchants to replicate the commercial success of Mother's Day, and newspapers frequently featured cynical and sarcastic attacks and jokes.[12] But the trade groups did not give up: they kept promoting it and even incorporated the jokes into their adverts, and they eventually succeeded.[13] By the mid-1980s, the Father's Council wrote that \"(...) [Father's Day] has become a Second Christmas for all the men's gift-oriented industries.\"[14]\nA bill to accord national recognition of the holiday was introduced in Congress in 1913.[15] In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson went to Spokane to speak at a Father's Day celebration[16] and wanted to make it official, but Congress resisted, fearing that it would become commercialized.[17] US President Calvin Coolidge recommended in 1924 that the day be observed by the nation but stopped short of issuing a national proclamation.[16] Two earlier attempts to formally recognize the holiday had been defeated by Congress.[16][18] In 1957, Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith wrote a proposal accusing Congress of ignoring fathers for 40 years while honoring mothers, thus \"[singling] out just one of our two parents\".[18] In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued the first presidential proclamation honoring fathers, designating the third Sunday in June as Father's Day.[17] Six years later, the day was made a permanent national holiday when President Richard Nixon signed it into law on April 24, 1972.[2][16][17][18]\nIn addition to Father's Day, International Men's Day is celebrated in many countries on November 19 for men and boys who are not fathers.\nA \"Father's Day\" service was held on July 5, 1908, in Fairmont, West Virginia, in the Williams Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church South, now known as Central United Methodist Church.[6] Grace Golden Clayton was mourning the loss of her father who died when, on December 6, 1907, the Monongah mining disaster in nearby Monongah killed 361 men, 250 of them fathers, leaving around a thousand fatherless children. Clayton suggested to her pastor, Robert Thomas Webb, that he should honor all those fathers.[19][20][21] Clayton chose the Sunday nearest to the birthday of her father, Methodist minister Fletcher Golden.\nClayton's event did not have repercussions outside of Fairmont for several reasons, among them: the city was overwhelmed by other events, the celebration was never promoted outside of the town itself and no proclamation was made in the City Council. Also two events overshadowed this event: the celebration of Independence Day July 4, 1908, with 12,000 attendees and several shows including a hot air balloon event, which took over the headlines in the following days, and the death of a 16-year-old girl on July 4. The local church and Council were overwhelmed and they did not even think of promoting the event, and it was not celebrated again for many years. The original sermon was not reproduced in the press, and it was lost. Finally, Clayton was a quiet person, who never promoted the event or even talked to other persons about it.[19][20][21]\nClayton also may have been inspired by Anna Jarvis' crusade to establish Mother's Day; two months prior, Jarvis had held a celebration for her dead mother in Grafton, West Virginia, a town about 15 miles (24 km) away from Fairmont.[citation needed]\nIn 1911, Jane Addams proposed a citywide Father's Day in Chicago, but she was turned down.[7]\nIn 1912, there was a Father's Day celebration in Vancouver, Washington, suggested by Methodist pastor J. J. Berringer of the Irvingtom Methodist Church. They believed mistakenly that they had been the first to celebrate such a day.[6] They followed a 1911 suggestion by the Portland Oregonian.[7]\nHarry C. Meek, member of Lions Clubs International, claimed that he had the first idea for Father's Day in 1915.[6][7] Meek claimed that the third Sunday of June was chosen because it was his birthday (it would have been more natural to choose his father's birthday).[7] The Lions Club has named him \"Originator of Father's Day\".[6] Meek made many efforts to promote Father's Day and make it an official holiday.[6][7]\nIn the United States, Dodd used the \"Fathers' Day\" spelling on her original petition for the holiday,[3] but the spelling \"Father's Day\" was already used in 1913 when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress as the first attempt to establish the holiday,[15] and it was still spelled the same way when its creator was commended in 2008 by the U.S. Congress.[22]\n^Butler, Joey (June 18, 2010). \"Father's Day has Methodist ties\". The United Methodist Church. Retrieved June 17, 2015. In 1909 in Spokane, Wash., Sonora Smart Dodd listened to a Mother's Day sermon at Central Methodist Episcopal Church. Dodd's own mother had died 11 years earlier, and her father had raised their six children alone. Dodd felt moved to honor her father, and fathers everywhere, with a special day as well. She proposed her idea to local religious leaders, and gained wide acceptance. June 19, 1910, was designated as the first Father's Day, and sermons honoring fathers were presented throughout the city.",

The top-ranked player is the player who, over the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ranking points on the ATP Tour. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.[2] Starting in 1979, an updated rankings list is released at the beginning of each week. Since 1973, 28 players have been ranked No. 1 by the ATP,[3][4] of which 17 have been year-end No. 1.\nSince the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo, the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250 tournaments. Lower-ranked players who are not eligible for some or all of the top tournaments may include additional ATP 500 and ATP 250 events, and also ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Men's Circuit tournaments. Players who qualify for the year-end ATP Finals also include any points gained from the tournament in their total, increasing the number of tournaments counted to 19.[5]\nCarlos Alcaraz is both the youngest world No. 1 (19 years, 4 months),[18] and the youngest year-end No. 1 (19 years, 7 months).[19] Federer is the oldest No. 1 (36 years, 10 months),[20] while Djokovic is the oldest year-end No. 1 (36 years, 7 months).[21]\nFederer is the player with the longest time span (14 years) between his first and most recent dates at No. 1 (February 2004\u2013June 2018),[22] while Rafael Nadal is the only player to hold the top ranking in three different decades, spanning 11 years and 5 months (2008\u20132020). Djokovic has the longest time span (12 years) between his first and last year-end No. 1 finish (2011\u20132023), and is the only player to be ranked No. 1 at least once in a year for 12 different years.[23]\nTwo players, Ivan Lendl and Marcelo R\u00edos, have reached No. 1 without previously having won a major singles title.[24] Lendl reached No. 1 on February 21, 1983, but did not win his first Grand Slam title until the 1984 French Open.[25] R\u00edos reached No. 1 on March 30, 1998, but retired without ever having won a Grand Slam title, making him the only No. 1 player with that distinction.[26][27]\nFederer holds the record of wire-to-wire No. 1 for three consecutive calendar years. Since 1973 when the ATP rankings started, there have been 13 years in which one player held the top spot for the entire year: Jimmy Connors in 1975, 1976, and 1978; Lendl in 1986 and 1987; Pete Sampras in 1994 and 1997; Hewitt in 2002; Federer in 2005, 2006, and 2007; and Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. In contrast, 1999 saw five players hold the No. 1 ranking (the most in any single year): Sampras, Carlos Moy\u00e1, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Andre Agassi, and Patrick Rafter.\nPrior to 2009, Federer accumulated the most year-end ATP ranking points in any season, with 8,370 points in 2006. Since the introduction of a new point scale for the ATP rankings from 2009, Djokovic achieved the same feat with 16,585 ranking points in 2015 season. Djokovic also holds the record of 16,950 ranking points on 6 June 2016, the most ATP points ever accumulated by any player.[28]\nJohn McEnroe held the No. 1 ranking a record 14 times, Sampras and Djokovic are the only two other players to have held it 10 or more times, with 11 and 10 stints respectively. Rafter spent the least time at number 1 (one week).\nNovak Djokovic holds an all-time record of eight year-end No. 1 finishes.Pete Sampras finished six consecutive seasons as year-end No. 1 in the 1990s.John McEnroe finished as the year-end No. 1 for four consecutive years in the 1980s.\nThe ATP year-end No. 1 (ATP Player of the Year), in recent decades, has been determined as the player who ends the year as world No. 1 in the ATP rankings. Prior to the early 1990s this was not always the case, in some instances the \"ATP Player of the Year\" and the Year-end No. 1 in the rankings were different players (1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1982, 1989). Novak Djokovic holds the ATP record of eight year-end No. 1 finishes.[15] Overall, 18 players have achieved the year-end No. 1 ranking, only four of them (Lendl, Federer, Djokovic, Nadal) have done so in non-consecutive years. Six players have stayed at No. 1 in the ATP rankings for every week of the calendar year. Connors and Federer have done so in three years, Connors non-consecutively and Federer consecutively.\n^Wilansky, Matt (August 31, 2006). \"Inside the numbers\". ESPN. ESPN Internet Ventures.

The vernal, or spring, equinox falls on March 20 or 21, and the autumnal equinox is on September 22 or 23.\nThe seasons in the Northern Hemisphere are the opposite of those in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that in Argentina and Australia, winter begins in June. The winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere is June 20 or 21, while the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, is December 21 or 22.\nSeasons occur because Earth is tilted on its axis relative to the orbital plane, the invisible, flat disc where most objects in the solar system orbit the sun. Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s axis is an invisible line that runs through its center, from pole to pole. Earth rotates around its axis.\nIn June, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rays hit it for a greater part of the day than in winter. This means it gets more hours of daylight. In December, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, with fewer hours of daylight.\nSeasons have an enormous influence on vegetation and plant growth. Winter typically has cold weather, little daylight, and limited plant growth. In spring, plants sprout, tree leaves unfurl, and flowersblossom. Summer is the warmest time of the year and has the most daylight, so plants grow quickly. In autumn, temperatures drop, and many trees lose their leaves.\nThe four-season year is typical only in the mid-latitudes. The mid-latitudes are places that are neither near the poles nor near the Equator. The farther north you go, the bigger the differences in the seasons. Helsinki, Finland, sees 18.5 hours of daylight in the middle of June. In mid-December, however, it is light for less than six hours. Athens, Greece, in southern Europe, has a smaller variation. It has 14.5 hours of daylight in June and 9.5 hours in December.\nPlaces near the Equator experience little seasonal variation. They have about the same amount of daylight and darkness throughout the year. These places remain warm year-round. Near the Equator, regions typically have alternating rainy and dry seasons.\nPolar regions experience seasonal variation, although they are generally colder than other places on Earth. Near the poles, the amount of daylight changes dramatically between summer and winter. In Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost city in the U.S., it stays light all day long between mid-May and early August. The city is in total darkness between mid-November and January.\nFast Fact\nSeasons in Alaska Sometimes, seasons are determined by both natural and artificial activity. In the U.S. state of Alaska, people like to say there are three seasons: \"winter, still winter, and construction season.\"\nFast Fact\nMeteorological Seasons Meteorologists, scientists who study the weather, divide each of the seasons into three whole months. Spring begins March 1, summer begins June 1, autumn begins September 1, and winter begins December 1.\nFast Fact\nRitu A ritu is a season in the traditional Hindu calendar, used in parts of India. There are six ritu: vasanta (spring); grishma (summer); varsha (rainy or monsoon); sharat (autumn); hemant (pre-winter); and shishira (winter).\nFast Fact\n'Tis the Season The word 'season' can be used to signify a time of year when an activity or process is allowed to happen. Seasons can be natural, like hurricane season, which is the time of year when hurricanes are most likely to develop. Seasons can also be artificially created, like hunting season, which is the time of year a community allows people to hunt certain wild animals.\nThe audio, illustrations, photos, and videos are credited beneath the media asset, except for promotional images, which generally link to another page that contains the media credit.

        "context": "\nThe Nebula Award for Best Novel is given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasynovels. A work of fiction is considered a novel by the organization if it is 40,000 words or longer; awards are also given out for pieces of shorter lengths, in the categories of short story, novelette, and novella. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration, a novel must have been published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible, provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition.[1] The Award has been given annually since 1966. Novels which were expanded forms of previously published stories are eligible, and novellas published individually can be considered as novels if the author requests it.[1] The award has been described as one of \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\" and \"the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent\" of the Emmy Awards.[2][3]\nNebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of SFWA, though the authors nominated do not need to be members. Works are nominated each year by members in a period around December 15 through January 31, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Soon after, members are given a month to vote on the ballot, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.[1]\nBeginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format, and nominated works must have been published during that calendar year. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as being one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication, and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Under the previous process, works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work if they felt it was overlooked.[4]\nDuring the 58 nomination years, 199 authors have had works nominated, and 45 of these have won (including co-authors and ties). Ursula K. Le Guin has received the most Nebula Awards for Best Novel, with four wins out of six nominations. Joe Haldeman has received the next most: three awards out of four nominations, while nine other authors have each won twice. Jack McDevitt has the most nominations at twelve (with one win), while Poul Anderson and Philip K. Dick tie for having the most nominations without winning an award, at five apiece.\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\". Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer's name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.",

        "context": "\nDonald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021.\nTrump received a BS in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, and his father named him president of his real estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it the Trump Organization and expanded its operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business reversals in the late twentieth century, he successfully launched various side ventures that required little capital, mostly by licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.\nTrump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote.[a] During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the first U.S. president with no prior military or government experience. The 2017\u20132019 special counsel investigation established that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump's campaign. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist and many as misogynistic.\nTrump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. He refused to concede defeat, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud, and attempted to overturn the results by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, which many of them then attacked, resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count.\nTrump is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he tried to pressure Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached in December by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress; he was acquitted by the Senate in February 2020. The House impeached him a second time in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection, and the Senate acquitted him the next month. Scholars and historians rank Trump as one of the worst presidents in American history.[1][2]\nWhile in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments during the Vietnam War era.[11] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968, a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve.[12] In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional medical deferment,[13] and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F due to bone spurs, permanently disqualifying him from service.[14]\nTrump has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\" but usually does not walk the course.[28] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes exercise depletes the body's energy \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\".[29] In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that Trump would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[30] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three Trump agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office.[30][31]\nIn 1982, Trump made the initial Forbes list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth (equivalent to $606 million in 2022).[32] His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[33] After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with the FEC in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10 billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities.[34]Forbes estimated his net worth dropped by $1.4 billion between 2015 and 2018.[35] In their 2021 billionaires ranking, Trump's net worth was estimated to be $2.4 billion (1,299th in the world).[36]\nJournalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that Trump called him in 1984, pretending to be a fictional Trump Organization official named \"John Barron\". Greenberg said that Trump, speaking as \"Barron\", falsely asserted that he owned more than 90 percent of his father's business to get a higher ranking for himself on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.[37]\nTrump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[38] He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's company.[39][40] In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance started an investigation.[40] His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets.[41][42]Forbes estimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $3.1 billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23 million to $3 million.[43]\nContrary to his claims of financial health and business acumen, Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250 million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7 million (equivalent to $1.76 billion in 2022).[44][45][32]\nIn 2020, the New York Times obtained Trump's tax information extending over two decades. Its reporters found that Trump reported losses of hundreds of millions of dollars and had, since 2010, deferred declaring $287 million in forgiven debt as taxable income. His income mainly came from his share in The Apprentice and businesses in which he was a minority partner, and his losses mainly from majority-owned businesses. Much income was in tax credits for his losses, which let him avoid annual income tax payments or lower them to $750. During the 2010s, Trump balanced his businesses' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower (due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.[46]\nAs of October 2021[update], Trump had over $1.3 billion in total debts, much of which is secured by his assets.[47] In 2020, he owed $640 million to banks and trust organizations, including Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, and approximately $450 million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt.[48]\nTrump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[53] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for Trump by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[50][54] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[55] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[56] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[57][58]\nIn 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks.[59] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[60] In 1995, Trump defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a humiliating restructuring that allowed Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy.[61][62] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they \"all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead.\"[62]\nIn 1996, Trump acquired the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building, and renovated it.[63] In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who were able to finance the project's completion, Riverside South.[64]\nIn 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[65] It was unprofitable, and Trump paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[66] In 1985, Trump bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[67] His wife Ivana managed it until 1988.[68] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[69]\nTrump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[70][71] Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, Trump gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[72] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[73]\nIn 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[74] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership.[65] He remained chairman until 2009.[75]\nIn 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[76] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[77] In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.[58]\nThe Trump name has been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings.[81][82] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, and they have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies.[83] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[81]\nTrump and New Jersey Generals quarterback Doug Flutie at a 1985 press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower\nIn September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (when they competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit against the organization.[84][85]\nFrom 1986 to 1988, Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[44] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail.[89]The New York Times found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".[44]\nIn 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $940 million in 2022)[32] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992.[90] Trump defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[91] The airline was eventually sold to US Airways.[90]\nIn 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20\u201350 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups.[40][92] The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units.[40]\nIn 2004, Trump co-founded Trump University, a company that sold real estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000.[99] After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[100]\nIn 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[101] In addition, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[102][103][104] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, Trump agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.[105]\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[106][107] In the foundation's final years, its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014.[108] The foundation gave to health-care- and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[109]\nIn 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[110] Also in 2016, the New York Attorney General determined the foundation to be in violation of state law for soliciting donations and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[111] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[112]\nIn June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[113][114] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[115] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[116][117]\nRoy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[118] According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.[118] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the United States government for $100 million (equivalent to $659 million in 2022)[32] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case went forward, ultimately resulting in a settlement.[119] In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[120] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[121]\nAccording to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[122] While Trump has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[123] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties.[123]\nDuring the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.[124] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[125] After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with Trump or his company in the future.[126]\nStarting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[133] He also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped! (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.[134][135] From 2011 until 2015, he was a weekly unpaid guest commentator on Fox & Friends.[136][137]\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Trump was co-producer and host of reality shows The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice. Trump played a flattering, highly fictionalized version of himself as a superrich and successful chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase \"You're fired\". The shows remade his image for millions of viewers nationwide.[138][139] With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million which he invested in largely unprofitable businesses.[140]\nIn February 2021, Trump resigned from the Screen Actors Guild he had been a member of since 1989 rather than face a disciplinary committee hearing for inciting the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and for his \"reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists\".[141] Two days later, the union permanently barred him from readmission.[142]\nTrump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in 1987;[143] a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999;[144] a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[143]\nIn 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers,[145] expressing his views on foreign policy and on how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[146] He ruled out running for local office but not for the presidency.[145] In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's running mate. Bush found the request \"strange and unbelievable\".[147]\nTrump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[156] He adopted the phrase \"truthful hyperbole\", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style.[128][157] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[158] and a record number of them were false.[159][160][161] The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has.\"[162][163] Trump said he disdained political correctness and frequently made claims of media bias.[164][165]\nTrump campaigning in Arizona, March 2016\nTrump announced his candidacy in June 2015.[166][167]His campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[168] He became the front-runner in March 2016[169] and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[170]\nTrump helped bring far-right fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[185] Trump was slow to disavow an endorsement from David Duke after he was questioned about it during a CNN interview on February 28, 2016.[186] Duke enthusiastically supported Trump and said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to \"take our country back\".[187][188] In August 2016, Trump hired Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u2014described by Bannon as \"the platform for the alt-right\"\u2014as his campaign CEO.[189] The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[190][191][192]\nTrump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.[34][193]\nTrump did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[194][195] He said his tax returns were being audited, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[196] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the United States Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[197][198]\nIn October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.[199]\nTrump's election victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities in the days following the election.[206][207] On the day after Trump's inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including an estimated half million in Washington, D.C., protested against Trump in the Women's Marches.[208]\nTrump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[209]\nBefore being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and a business associate.[212][213] Though he said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic. Trump continued to profit from his businesses and to know how his administration's policies affected his businesses.[213][214]\nIn December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The bill had been passed by both Republican-controlled chambers of Congress without any Democratic votes. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025, and eliminated the penalty associated with Affordable Care Act's individual mandate.[220][221] The Trump administration claimed that the act would either increase tax revenues or pay for itself by prompting economic growth. Instead, revenues in 2018 were 7.6 percent lower than projected.[222]\nDespite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump approved large increases in government spending and the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.[223] Under Trump, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75trillion by the end of his term, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post-World War II high.[224] Trump also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[225]\nTrump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3 million people.[218]\nTrump aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels.[230][231] Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[232][233] Trump rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Trump's actions while president have been called \"a very aggressive attempt to rewrite our laws and reinterpret the meaning of environmental protections\".[234]\nIn January 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, though it did not require elimination.[235] He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[236][237] labor,[238][237] and the environment,[239][237] among other topics. Trump signed 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions repealing federal regulations, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[240] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[241] often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[242] The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of Trump's proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[243]\nDuring his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[244] In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders 13765[245] and 13813.[246] Trump expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[247][248] Trump falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA.[249] In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the ACA unconstitutional.[250][251] If they had succeeded, it would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans.[250] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020, he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.[252]\nIn response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 deaths in 2019.[253]\nTrump barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[254] He said he supported \"traditional marriage\" but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[255] In March 2017, his administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBT people.[256] Trump's attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections for transgender patients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after the Supreme Court's ruling in July had extended employees' civil rights protections to gender identity and sexual orientation.[257]\nTrump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush.[267]\nOnly 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[268][269]\nFrom 2017 to 2019, he pardoned, amongst others, former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of classified areas inside a submarine;[270] and right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza.[271] Following a request by celebrity Kim Kardashian, Trump commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who had been convicted of drug trafficking.[272] Trump also pardoned or reversed the sentences of three American servicemen convicted or accused of committing war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq.[273]\nTrump and group of officials and advisors on the way from White House complex to St. John's Church\nOn June 1, 2020, federal law-enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House.[278][279] Trump then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church, where protesters had set a small fire the night before; he posed for photographs holding a Bible, with senior administration officials later joining him in photos.[278][280] Trump said on June 3 that the protesters were cleared because \"they tried to burn down the church [on May 31] and almost succeeded\", describing the church as \"badly hurt\".[281]\nReligious leaders condemned the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[282] Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[283]\nTrump attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.[290][291]\nFrom 2018 onward, Trump deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border[292] to stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum. In 2020, his administration widened the public charge rule to further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency via green cards.[293] Trump reduced the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. to record lows. When Trump took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.[294][295] Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted compared to the allowed limits.[296]\nFollowing the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[297] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[298]\nThe temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[305] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017,[306] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling.[307]\nThe Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[308][309] In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted.[310] This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors.[311] Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.[312]\nThe policy of family separations was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.[312][313] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration's policy.[314][315][316]\nAlthough Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" doing so would pose a risk to the child.[317][318] On June 26, 2018, Judge Dana Sabraw concluded that the Trump administration had \"no system in place to keep track of\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;[319] Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.[320] After the federal-court order, the Trump administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; the ACLU contended that the Trump administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.[309]\nOne of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[321] By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64 km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53 km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587 km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[322]\nIn 2018, Trump refused to sign any appropriations bill from Congress unless it allocated $5.6 billion in funds for the border wall,[323] resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.[324][325] Around 800,000 government employees were furloughed or worked without pay.[326] Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall.[324] The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3 billion to the economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office.[327] About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped.[328]\nTrump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[335] and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[336] His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of populist, neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments.[337] Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty,[336] a lack of a consistent foreign policy,[338] and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies.[339] He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from the alliance.[340][341]\nTrump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[342] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[343] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[344] While Trump said that import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[345] Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the trade deficit in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, \"was the largest monthly deficit since July 2008\".[346] Following a 2017\u20132018 renegotiation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[347]\nHowever, no denuclearization agreement was reached,[381] and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[382] While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.[383][384]\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meeting with Taliban delegation in Qatar in September 2020\nU.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[385] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[386] In February 2020, the Trump administration signed a conditional peace agreement with the Taliban, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000 Taliban imprisoned by the Afghan government.[387][388][389] By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating Al-Qaeda members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[389]\nIn December 2018, Trump declared \"we have won against ISIS\", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.[401][402] The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling his decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s Kurdish allies who played a key role in fighting ISIS.[403] One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.[404]\nIn October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area and Turkey invaded northern Syria, attacking and displacing American-allied Kurds in the area.[405] Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for \"abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe\".[406][407]\nAfter an Iranian missile test on January 29, 2017, and Houthi attacks on Saudi warships, the Trump administration sanctioned 12 companies and 13 individuals suspected of being involved in Iran's missile program.[408] In May 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program.[409][410] Analysts determined that, after the United States's withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[411]\nThe Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[418] As of early July 2018[update], 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[419] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[420] Both figures set a record for recent presidents\u2014more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[421] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[421] Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee, and Keith Schiller quit or were forced out.[422] Some, including Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts.[423] Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[424]\nOn May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's roles in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[428] At a private conversation in February, Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.[429] In March and April, Trump asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.[429][430]\nTurnover was relatively high within the Trump Cabinet.[422] Trump lost three of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year.[431] Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.[431][422] Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.[432][433]\nTrump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[434] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61 percent) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37 percent).[435]\nTrump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. Trump's attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of Trump's statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.[444][445][446]\nTrump's public statements on COVID-19 were at odds with his private statements. In February 2020 Trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly than influenza, was \"very much under control\", and would soon be over.[451] At the same time he acknowledged the opposite in a private conversation with Bob Woodward. In March 2020, Trump privately told Woodward that he was deliberately \"playing it down\" in public so as not to create panic.[452][453]\nTrump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[454][455] Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak, and largely ignored the danger.[456] By mid-March, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the emerging pandemic.[457]\nOn March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.[458] On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic,[447] and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13.[459] That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \"horrible\" but \"a temporary moment\" and saying there was no financial crisis.[460] On March 13, he declared a national emergency, freeing up federal resources.[461] Trump falsely claimed that \"anybody that wants a test can get a test\", despite the availability of tests being severely limited.[462]\nIn September 2019, the Trump administration terminated United States Agency for International Development's PREDICT program, a $200 million epidemiological research program initiated in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad.[463][464] The program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. One such laboratory was the Wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes COVID-19. After revival in April 2020, the program was given two 6-month extensions to help fight COVID-19 in the U.S. and other countries.[465][466]\nOn April 22, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration to the United States.[467] In late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.[468]\nTrump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020.[469] Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[470] sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[471] Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[470][472] On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[473] His repeated use of the terms \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[474][475][476]\nBy early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the World Health Organization (WHO).[477] The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[478] the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[479][480]\nIn early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would \"indefinitely\" continue.[481] By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced.[482]\nPrior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[483] His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[483] In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus\" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic.[483][484][485] He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[483] Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[483][486][487] In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021.[484][485] The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\".[484][485]\nIn June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\".[488][489] The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[490][491] In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[492][493] The day after this political interference was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested.[493]\nIn April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[494][495] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[496] even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's own guidelines for reopening.[497] In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[498] Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy.[499]\nTrump often refused to wear a face mask at public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public[500] and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus.[501] By June, Trump had said masks were a \"double-edged sword\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[501] Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[500][501]\nDespite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are \"totally harmless\".[502][503] He also began insisting that all states should open schools to in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.[504]\nTrump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[492] such as approving unproven treatments[505][506] or speeding up the approval of vaccines.[506] Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[507][508] Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[509]\nOn October 2, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID-19.[510][511] His wife, their son Barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected.[512][513]\nLater that day Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to labored breathing and a fever. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October 5, still struggling with the disease.[514] During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.[512] In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case of the disease.[513]\nBy July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue for the 2020 presidential election.[515] Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election.[516] Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[515] and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[517] In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths.[518] A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[519]\nAfter he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[520] There were 30 investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[521]\nDuring the 2016 presidential election campaign, American Media, Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer,[528] and a company set up by Cohen paid Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actressStormy Daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[529] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump to influence the presidential election.[530] Trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017.[531][532] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[533] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[534][535] Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019,[536] but the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments[537] and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns.[538] In November 2022, The New York Times reported that Manhattan prosecutors were \"newly optimistic about building a case\" against Trump.[539]\nIn January 2017, American intelligence agencies\u2014the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence\u2014jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[540][541] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[542] Many suspicious[543]links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies were discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\" were widely reported by the press.[544][545]\nManafort, one of Trump's campaign managers, worked from December 2004 to February 2010 to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency.[546] Other Trump associates, including Flynn and Stone, were connected to Russian officials.[547][548] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[549] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[550][551] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.[552] Trump told Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[553]\nTrump and his allies promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election\u2014which was also promoted by Russia to frame Ukraine.[554] After the Democratic National Committee was hacked, Trump first claimed it withheld \"its server\" from the FBI (in actuality there were more than 140 servers, of which digital copies were given to the FBI); second, that CrowdStrike, the company that investigated the servers, was Ukraine-based and Ukrainian-owned (in actuality, CrowdStrike is U.S.-based, with the largest owners being American companies); and third that \"the server\" was hidden in Ukraine. Members of the Trump administration spoke out against the conspiracy theories.[555]\nIn July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamed Crossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[556] After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia.[557] Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[558] but deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ended the investigation into Trump's direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that Mueller would pursue the matter.[559][560]\nIn May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, special counsel for the Department of Justice (DOJ), ordering him to \"examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the Trump campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference\".[559] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[561] and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[562] Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[563]\nIn March 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr.[564] Two days later, Barr sent a letter to Congress purporting to summarize the report's main conclusions. A federal court, as well as Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation's conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.[565][566][567] Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not exonerate him.[568]\nA redacted version of the report was publicly released in April 2019. It found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's.[569] Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the report found that the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[570][571] The report revealed sweeping Russian interference[571] and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing \"[they] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\".[572][573][574][575]\nThe report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not make a \"traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on whether Trump broke the law, suggesting that Congress should make such a determination.[576][577] Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\" as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,[578] and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[579] The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[578] The House of Representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[580][581]\nSeveral Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller's investigation and related cases, including Manafort, convicted on eight felony counts,[582] deputy campaign manager Rick Gates,[583] foreign policy advisor Papadopoulos,[584] and Flynn.[585][586] Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as \"Individual-1\" in the court documents.[587] In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering regarding his attempts to learn more about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 election. The sentencing judge said Stone \"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\".[588]\nIn August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter.[589] The whistleblower said that the White House had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.[590]\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[591] Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.[592][593] On September 25, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.[589][594] The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[595] In October, William B. Taylor Jr., the charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment investigating the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[596] He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.[597]\nDuring the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers presented their case for three days. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution's impeachment process.[600]\nTrump displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted\"\nResponding over the next three days, Trump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[601] They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[601]\nOn January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents; 51 Republicans formed the majority for this vote.[602] The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.[603]\nTrump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority, 52\u201348 on abuse of power and 53\u201347 on obstruction of Congress. Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict Trump on one charge, the abuse of power.[604] Following his acquittal, Trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.[605]\nBreaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[606] He held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office[607] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.[608]\nIn his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million and began 2019 with $19.3 million in cash.[609] By July 2020, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1 billion and spent $800 million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.[610] The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.[611]\nTrump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won the presidency.[612] Trump repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions[613][614] and shifted to appeals to racism.[615]\nStarting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[616][617] In July, Trump raised the idea of delaying the election.[618] When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[619] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.[620][621]\nBiden won the election on November 3, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent)[622][623] and 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.[624]\nAt 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[625] After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump stated that \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[626] Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[627][628] Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials.[629] After Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17.[630] On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from the Texas attorney general that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[631]\nTrump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.[632] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition.[633][634] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[635] Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.[636][637]\nThe Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14.[624] From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results of the election, personally pressuring various Republican local and state office-holders,[638] Republican state and federal legislators,[639] the Justice Department,[640] and Vice President Pence,[641] urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result.[639] On February 10, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.[642]\nIn December 2020, Newsweek reported the Pentagon was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if Trump decided to declare martial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of elections.[644]\nWhen Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and CIA director Gina Haspel became concerned about the threat of a possible coup attempt or military action against China or Iran.[645][646] Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed Haspel and NSA director Paul Nakasone to monitor developments closely.[647][648]\nOn January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the United States Capitol, Trump held a noon rally at the Ellipse, Washington, D.C.. He called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol to \"show strength\" and \"fight like hell\".[649][650] Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. Around 2:15p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[651] During the violence, Trump watched TV and posted messages on Twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. At 6p.m., Trump tweeted that the rioters should \"go home with love & in peace\", calling them \"great patriots\" and \"very special\" and repeating that the election was stolen from him.[652] After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning.[653] According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.[654][655]\nIn March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a song to benefit the prisoners, and, in June, he said that, if elected, he would pardon a large number of them.[656]\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signing the second impeachment of Trump\nOn January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection against the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[657] The House voted 232\u2013197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[658] Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment\u2014the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[659]\nOn February 13, following a five-day Senate trial, Trump was acquitted when the Senate voted 57\u201343 for conviction, falling ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.[660][661] Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January 20; the Senate voted 56\u201344 the trial was constitutional);[662] included in the latter group was Mitch McConnell.[663]\nAt the end of his term, Trump went to live at his Mar-a-Lago club.[664] As provided for by the Former Presidents Act,[665] he established an office there to handle his post-presidential activities.[665][666]\nTrump's false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \"big lie\" in the press and by his critics. In May 2021, Trump and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself.[667][668] The Republican Party used Trump's false election narrative to justify the imposition of new voting restrictions in its favor.[668][669] As late as July 2022, Trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election by rescinding the state's electoral votes for Biden.[670]\nUnlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; he has been compared to a modern-day party boss. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, hinted at a third candidacy, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on the people in charge of elections and how elections are run. In the 2022 midterm elections he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices, most of whom supported his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.[674][675][676] A majority of candidates endorsed by him won in Republican primary elections.[675]\nIn February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social, a Twitter-like social-media platform.[682] As of March 2023[update], Trump Media, which had taken $8 million from Russia-connected entities, was being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible money laundering.[683][684]\nWhen Trump left the White House in January 2021, he took government documents and material with him to Mar-a-Lago. By May 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the federal agency that preserves government records, realized that important documents had not been turned over to them at the end of Trump's term and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA later informed the Department of Justice that some of the retrieved documents were classified material.[692] The Justice Department began an investigation in April 2022 and convened a grand jury.[693] The Justice Department sent Trump a subpoena for additional material on May 11.[692] On June 3, Justice Department officials visited Mar-a-Lago and received some classified documents from Trump's lawyers.[692] One of the lawyers signed a statement affirming that all material marked as classified had been returned to the government.[694] Later that month an additional subpoena was sent requesting surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, which was provided.[692][695][696]\nOn August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Trump's residence, office, and storage areas at Mar-a-Lago to recover government documents and material Trump had taken with him when he left office in violation of the Presidential Records Act,[697][698] reportedly including some related to nuclear weapons.[696] The search warrant, authorized by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and approved by a federal magistrate judge, and the written inventory of the seized items were made public on August 12. The text of the search warrant indicates an investigation of potential violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice laws.[699] The items taken in the search included 11 sets of classified documents, four of them tagged as \"top secret\" and one as \"top secret/SCI\", the highest level of classification.[697][698]\nOn March 30, 2023, a New York grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.[703][704] On April 4, he surrendered and was arrested and arraigned; he pleaded not guilty on all counts and was released.[705] The trial is scheduled to begin on March 25, 2024.[706]\nOn June 8, the Justice Department indicted Trump in Miami federal court for 31 counts of \"willfully retaining national defense information under the Espionage Act\", one count of making false statements, and, jointly with a personal aide, single counts of conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding government documents, corruptly concealing records, concealing a document in a federal investigation and scheming to conceal their efforts.[707] Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.[708] In July a superseding indictment added three additional criminal charges, bringing the number of charges in the case to 40.[709] The trial is scheduled to begin on May 20, 2024.[706]\nOn August 1, a Washington, D.C., federal grand jury indicted Trump on four counts for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. He was charged with conspiring with unnamed co-conspirators to defraud the United States, obstruct the certification of the Electoral College vote, and deprive people of the civil right to have their votes counted, as well as obstructing an official proceeding.[710] Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.[711] The case is slated to go to trial on March 4, 2024.[706]\nOn August 14, a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury indicted Trump and 18 allies for racketeering \u2013 among other felonies \u2013 after Trump campaign officials accessed voting machines with election officials.[712][713] On August 24, Trump surrendered, was placed under arrest and processed at Fulton County Jail, and released on bail. He posted the mug shot on Twitter and on his campaign website with a fundraising pitch.[714] On August 31, he pleaded not guilty.[715]\nIn 2018, four investors filed a federal class action lawsuit against Trump, the Trump Organization, and his three eldest children for not disclosing that they were paid by ACN, Inc., when they recommended the company as a sound investment on The Apprentice.[716] In July 2019, a district judge permitted the lawsuit to proceed with state-level claims of fraud, false advertising, and unfair competition.[717] The case is slated to go to trial on January 29, 2024.[718]\nIn September 2022, the New York State Attorney General filed a civil fraud case against Trump, his three oldest children, and the Trump Organization.[719] In December 2021, the Attorney General's office had subpoenaed Trump to produce documents related to his business.[720] In April 2022, a New York state judge held Trump in contempt of court for failing to comply with the subpoena and imposed a fine of $10,000 per day until he does.[721] Trump was deposed in August and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times.[722] The judge presiding over the civil suit ruled in September 2023 that Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization repeatedly committed fraud and ordered their New York business certificates canceled and their business entities sent into receivership for dissolution.[723]\nIn May 2023, a New York jury in a federal lawsuit brought by journalist E. Jean Carroll found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered him to pay her $5 million.[724] Trump asked the district court for a new trial or a reduction of the damage award, arguing that the jury had not found him liable for rape, and also, in a separate lawsuit, countersued Carroll for defamation. The judge for the two lawsuits ruled against Trump in July and August.[725][726] Trump appealed both decisions to an appeals court.[725][727] The trial in the defamation case is scheduled to begin on January 15, 2024.[706]\nC-SPAN, which has surveyed presidential historians on presidential leadership each time the administration changed since 2000,[731] ranked Trump fourth\u2013lowest overall in their Presidential Historians Survey 2021, with Trump rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.[1][732][733] The Siena College Research Institute (SCRI) has surveyed presidential scholars during the second year of the first term of each president since 1982. In their 2022 survey, SCRI ranked Trump 43rd out of 45 presidents. He was ranked last on background, integrity, intelligence, foreign policy accomplishments, and executive appointments, and second to last on ability to compromise, executive ability, and present overall view. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership.[2]\nTrump was the only president never to reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938. His approval ratings showed a record-high partisan gap: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.[734] Until September 2020, the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of 49 percent and a low of 35 percent.[735] Trump finished his term with an approval rating between 29 percent and 34 percent\u2014the lowest of any president since modern polling began\u2014and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency.[734][736]\nIn Gallup's annual poll asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for most admired man in 2019, and was named most admired in 2020.[737][738] Since Gallup started conducting the poll in 1948, Trump is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.[739]\nA Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between the years 2016 and 2017 found that Trump led Obama in job approval in only 29 countries, most of them non-democracies;[740] approval of U.S. leadership plummeted among allies and G7 countries. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the George W. Bush presidency.[741] By mid-2020, only 16 percent of international respondents to a 13-nation Pew Research poll expressed confidence in Trump, a lower score than those accorded to Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.[742]\nAs a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks[163][159] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[746][747] His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.[746]\nTrump's false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied a total of 30,573 false or misleading statements made by Trump over his four-year term.[743] Trump's falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about six false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to 16 per day in his second year, 22 per day in his third year, and 39 per day in his final year.[748]\nSome of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his claim of the \"biggest inaugural crowd ever\".[749][750] Others had more far-reaching effects, such as his promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19 in a press conference and on Twitter.[751][752] The claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the United States and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[753][754] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served Trump's domestic political purposes.[755] As a matter of principle, Trump does not apologize for his falsehoods.[756]\nDespite the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, the media rarely referred to them as lies.[757][758] The first time The Washington Post did so was in August 2018, when it declared that some of Trump's misstatements, in particular those concerning hush money paid to Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, were lies.[759][758]\nIn 2020, Trump was a significant source of disinformation on mail-in voting and misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic.[760][761] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices served to weaken public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,[762][763] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.[455][760]\nJames Pfiffner, professor of policy and government at George Mason University, wrote in 2019 that Trump lies differently from previous presidents, because he offers \"egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well-known facts\"; these lies are the \"most important\" of all Trump lies. By calling facts into question, people will be unable to properly evaluate their government, with beliefs or policy irrationally settled by \"political power\"; this erodes liberal democracy, wrote Pfiffner.[764]\nDuring and since the 2020 presidential election, Trump has promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat including dead people voting,[771] voting machines changing or deleting Trump votes, fraudulent mail-in voting, throwing out Trump votes, and \"finding\" suitcases full of Biden votes.[772][773]\nResearch suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes.[774][775] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[776][777] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence.[778][779] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against members of minority groups.[780]\nTrump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He tweeted frequently during the 2016 election campaign and as president until Twitter banned him in the final days of his term.[781] Trump often used Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public and sidelining of the press.[782] In June 2017, a White House press secretary said that Trump's tweets were official presidential statements.[783] Trump often announced terminations of administration officials over Twitter.[784]\nAfter years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checking warnings in May 2020.[785] In response, Trump tweeted that \"Social Media Platforms totally silence conservative[] voices\" and that he would \"strongly regulate[] or close them down\".[786] In the days after the storming of the United States Capitol, Trump was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms.[787] The loss of Trump's social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[788][789] and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter.[790] Trump's early attempts to re-establish a social media presence were unsuccessful.[791] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[792]Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, reinstated Trump's Twitter account in November 2022.[793]\nTrump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love\u2013hate\" relationship with the press.[794] In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[156]The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV.\"[795]\nAs a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[796] In 2018, journalist Lesley Stahl recounted Trump's saying he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[797]\nAs president, Trump privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.[798] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[799] In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump.[800] The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[799]\nTrump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.[801] In early 2020, the Trump campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference.[802][803] Legal experts said that the lawsuits lacked merit and were not likely to succeed.[801][804] By March 2021, the lawsuits against The New York Times and CNN had been dismissed.[805][806]\nMany of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist.[807][808] In national polling, about half of respondents said that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[809][810] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[811][812] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[813]\nIn 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[49] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. As of 2019, he maintained this position.[814]\nIn 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, he became the leading proponent of the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.[815][816] In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him \"very popular\".[817][818] In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[819] In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views in private.[820]\nAccording to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist appeals to whites\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[821] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\".[822][823] His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding Trump University were also criticized as racist.[824]\nTrump answers questions from reporters about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\nIn a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[829] His remarks were condemned as racist.[830][831]\nIn July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen\u2014all from minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans\u2014should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[832] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240\u2013187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[833]White nationalist publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[834] Trump continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[835]\nTrump has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to media and on social media.[836][837] He made lewd comments, demeaned women's looks, and called them names, such as \"dog\", \"crazed\", \"crying lowlife\", \"face of a pig\", or \"horseface\".[837][838][839]\nAt least 26 women publicly accused Trump of rape, kissing, and groping without consent; looking under women's skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.[840][841][842] Trump has denied all of the allegations.[842]\nIn October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\"[843] The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign[844] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[845]\nTrump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature on television, in films, and in comics. He has been named in hundreds of hip hop songs since the 1980s\u2014until 2015, most of these references cast Trump in a positive light, but they turned largely negative after he began running for office.[846]\n^Presidential elections in the U.S. are decided by the Electoral College.

        "effective_year": "2023",
        "context": "\nWhile not as famous as some other rivalries, the rivalry has a long history that dates back to the 1960s. The beginning of the rivalry was dominated by the Dolphins, as at the time the Dolphins were one of the NFL's most successful teams, while the Patriots were one of the worst. This trend would change during the early 2000s when the Patriots became more and more successful, eventually culminating with the Brady & Belichick dynasty, while the Dolphins, and the rest of the AFC East, would become mired in mediocrity.[2][3][4][5][6] The Patriots finally made the Super Bowl in 1985, having defeated Miami in the AFC Championship game to get there.[7]\nStarting in 1986, the rivalry was a little bit more even, with the Pats having a 7-game winning streak from 1986 to 1988. The Dolphins then took over the rivalry once again, winning 13 of the next 15 matchups between the 2 teams. Both teams had great quarterbacks in the 1990s, with the Patriots having Drew Bledsoe and the Dolphins with Dan Marino, both of whom appeared in at least one Super Bowl; Marino in Super Bowl XIX and Bledsoe in Super Bowl XXXI. The Dolphins continued to dominate the rivalry through the late 1990s with the Dolphins sweeping the Patriots in back to back years, 1999 and 2000.\nMiami is one of 3 teams in the AFC with a winning overall record against New England (the others being the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs). Since 2003, the Patriots have dominated the rivalry, but not as much as their rivalries with their two other AFC East opponents.[8][9] In 2004, one of the most famous moments in the rivalry happened where the Dolphins, 2\u201311 at the time, upset the defending champion Patriots, who were 12\u20131, in a game that has been known as \"The Night That Courage Wore Orange\".[10] The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when Nick Saban (who previously served as defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns, coached by Bill Belichick at the time) was hired as the Dolphins head coach and when he nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees with the Dolphins, as well as in 2008 when the Dolphins became the only team other than the Patriots since 2003 to win the division.[11] In Week 3 of the aforementioned 2008 season, the Dolphins used the Wildcat formation to throw the Patriots (who were without Tom Brady that year because of an ACL injury earlier in the season) off and went on to upset them, 38\u201313, snapping their 20-game regular season winning streak that dated back to December 10, 2006, which coincidentally, the Patriots were also beat by the Dolphins.[12] In 2018, the Dolphins upset the Patriots in Miami for the second year in a row, this time with a last-minute hook and lateral scoring play in what is known as the \"Miracle in Miami\".[13]\nOn February 4, 2019, the Dolphins hired a long-time Patriots assistant, Brian Flores (who had been with the team since their 2004 Super Bowl-winning season) as the 12th head coach in franchise history. In 2021, the rivalry intensified once again after the Patriots drafted Alabama quarterback Mac Jones, a former college teammate of Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, whom Jones backed up in the first half of the 2019 season until a season-ending hip injury from Tagovailoa caused Jones to take the helms at quarterback for Alabama. Both quarterbacks led Alabama to national titles in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Jones and Tagovailoa were also backups to future Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts during the 2017 season, Jones and Tagovailoa's true freshman years.[citation needed] In 2022, the Dolphins hired former Patriots wide receiver Wes Welker to be their new wide receivers coach. Welker previously played for the Dolphins from 2004\u20132006 and the hiring would reunite him with Dolphins defensive coordinator and former long-time Patriots assistant Josh Boyer, whom was serving as a defensive assistant and later the defensive backs coach during Welker's tenure with New England (2007\u20132012).\nGame in Miami was the de facto AFC East Championship Game. But due to the Jets' loss the previous day, this game ironically decided whom would finish as the #3 seed and host the loser (as the #6 seeded wild card) in the AFC Wild Card Round the following week.\nDolphins frequently use the \"Wildcat\" formation to defeat Patriots, this formation gains popularity in the league. Dolphins win AFC East, the only season the Patriots did not win the division as well as miss the playoffs from 2003\u20132019. Tom Brady did not play in either game due to a season-ending knee injury in the season opener.",

The games considered for the award are family-style games. War games, role-playing games, collectible card games, and other complicated, highly competitive, or hobbyist games are outside the scope of the award. Since 1989, there has been a separate award for children's games. The jury is not subject to public scrutiny and members of the public are not offered the opportunity to influence the voting.\nOn occasion, the jury has awarded a special prize for more complex games, such as Agricola in 2008 or World Without End in 2010. Prior to 2011, this award was an exceptional award which was not necessarily awarded annually. In 2011, however, this practice was formalized when the jury created a new category for more complex games called Kennerspiel des Jahres. Along with the nominations, the jury also gives a list of recommended games, and occasionally gives out special prizes for games which will not be considered for the main award. The criteria on which a game is evaluated are:[4]\ngame concept (originality, playability, game value)\nrule structure (composition, clearness, comprehensibility)\nlayout (box, board, rules),\ndesign (functionality, workmanship)\nThe jury does not release its scoring system or provide insight into how the categories are weighted.\nThe nominations for the 2011 awards were announced on May 23, 2011, and the winners on June 27, 2011.

        "context": "\nSuper Bowl I is the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the U.S. by two different broadcasters simultaneously. At the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game, and each network used its own announcers, but NBC was only allowed to use the CBS feed instead of producing its own.[1][2] Beginning with Super Bowl II, NBC televised the game in even years and CBS in odd years. This annual rotation between the two networks continued through the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger when NBC was given the rights to televise AFC games and CBS winning the rights to broadcast NFC games. Although ABC began broadcasting Monday Night Football in 1970, it was not added to the Super Bowl rotation until Super Bowl XIX, played in January 1985. ABC, CBS and NBC then continued to rotate the Super Bowl until 1994, when Fox replaced CBS as the NFC broadcaster. CBS then took NBC's place in the rotation after the former replaced the later as the AFC broadcaster in 1998. As a result of new contracts signed in 2006, with NBC taking over Sunday Night Football from ESPN, and Monday Night Football moving from ABC to ESPN, NBC took ABC's place in the Super Bowl rotation. The rotation between CBS, Fox, and NBC will continue until the new contracts that will take effect starting in 2024, allowing ABC to return and starting a four-network rotation.[3]\nThe four-year rotation beginning with Super Bowl LVIII also allows each broadcaster to offer simulcasts or alternative broadcasts on its sister networks and platforms.[3] CBS's sister network Nickelodeon is planning to air an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII.[4] And ABC's rights include ESPN simulcasts and alternative broadcasts on other ESPN networks.[3]\nThe NFL has broken the traditional broadcasting rotation at least twice.[5][6][7] NBC originally had broadcasting rights for Super Bowl XXVI and CBS for Super Bowl XXVII, but the NFL allowed the networks to switch the two games in order to allow CBS a significant lead-in to its coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics. Likewise, NBC was to air Super Bowl LV and CBS for Super Bowl LVI, but the two networks agreed to swap the broadcasting rights. Therefore, CBS benefitted from holding rights to the Super Bowl and the 2021 NCAA final Four, and NBC was allowed to pair its Super Bowl coverage with the 2022 Winter Olympics.[7][8] Under the four-network rotation that will take effect in 2024, the league awarded NBC the Super Bowl during Winter Olympic years.[3]\nCBS has televised the most Super Bowl games, with Super Bowl LV as its 21st.\n^Note 1 : Super Bowl I was simulcast on both CBS (at the time the sole NFL network) and NBC[23] (the AFL network). From Super Bowl II onward, the networks began rotating exclusive coverage of the game on an annual basis. Super Bowls I\u2013VI were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place.\n^Note 3 : The television contract for 1990\u20131993 had each network having one Super Bowl telecast of the first three games as part of the package. The fourth Super Bowl (XXVIII) was up for a separate sealed bid. NBC won the bid, and since they were last in the rotation for Super Bowl coverage in the regular contract, ended up with two straight Super Bowls. CBS is the only other network to televise two Super Bowls (I and II) in a row. It is also of note that Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII are the first (and to date, only) back-to-back Super Bowls to feature the same two teams (Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills).\n^Note 5 : Under the 2013 television contract, Super Bowl LV was originally assigned to NBC, while Super Bowl LVI was originally assigned to CBS. In March 2019, CBS agreed to trade Super Bowl LVI to NBC in exchange for Super Bowl LV so that the former would not have to compete against the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n^Note 6 : CBS's sister network Nickelodeon is planning to air an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII. This would mark the first time that an alternative broadcast of the game will air on the broadcaster's sister network.[4]\n1 \u2013 Dates in the list denote the season, not necessarily the calendar year in which the championship game was played. For instance, Super Bowl LIV was played in 2020, but was the championship for the 2019 season.\n2 \u2013 From 1966 to 1969, the first four Super Bowls were \"World Championship\" games played between two independent professional football leagues, AFL and NFL, and when the league merged in 1970 the Super Bowl became the NFL Championship Game.",

        "effective_year": "2023",
        "context": "\nThe agricultural Berber calendar still in use is almost certainly derived from the Julian calendar, introduced in the Roman province of Africa at the time of Roman domination. The names of the months of this calendar are derived from the corresponding Latin names and traces of the Roman calendar denominations of Kalends, Nones and Ides exist: El Qabisi, an Islamic jurisconsult by Kairawan who lived in the 11th century, condemned the custom of celebrating \"pagans'\" festivals and cited, among traditional habits of North Africa, that of observing the Qalandas (\"Kalends\") of January (1 January, i.e. the Julian New Year's Day).[2] The length of the year and of the individual months is the same as in the Julian calendar: three years of 365 days followed by a leap year of 366, without exceptions, and 30- and 31-day months, except for the second one that has 28 days. The only slight discrepancy lies in that the extra day in leap years is not usually added at the end of February, but at the end of the year. This means that the beginning of the year (the first day of yennayer) corresponds to the 14th day of January in the Gregorian calendar, which coincides with the offset accumulated during the centuries between astronomical dates and the Julian calendar.\nIn addition, some of the month names in Maltese are of Berber origin, specifically January (jannar), February (frar), May (mejju), and August (awwissu), with the others deriving from Italian. Berber and Italian month names are different enough that it is possible to easily determine the source language of each Maltese month name.\nIn addition to the subdivision by months, within the traditional agricultural calendar there are other partitions, by \"seasons\" or by \"strong periods\", characterized by particular festivals and celebrations.\nNot all the four seasons have retained a Berber denomination: the words for spring and autumn are used almost everywhere, more sparingly the winter and, among northern Berbers, the Berber name for the autumn has been preserved only in Jebel Nafusa (Libya).\nAn interesting element is the existing opposition between two 40-day terms, one representing the allegedly coldest part of winter (\"The nights\", llyali) and one the hottest period of summer (\"The Dog Days\", ssmaym, awussu).[5]\nA page from a Tunisian calendar, showing the correspondence of 1 Yennayer \u02bfajmi (in red on bottom) with 14 January of the Gregorian calendar. The writing on the bottom signals that it is \u02bfajmiNew Year's Day and that al-lyali al-sud (\"the black nights\") are beginning.\nThe coldest period is made up by 20 \"white nights\" (Berber: i\u1e0dan imellalen, Arabic: al-lyali al-bi\u1e0d), from 12 to 31 dujamber (Gregorian dates: 25 December - 13 January), and 20 \"black nights\" (Berber: i\u1e0dan tiberkanin/is\u1e6d\u1e6dafen, Arabic al-lyali al-sud), beginning on the first day of yennayer, corresponding to the Gregorian 14 January.\nThe first day of the year is celebrated in various ways in the different parts of North Africa. A widespread tradition is a meal with particular foods, which vary from region to region (such as a couscous with seven vegetables). In some regions, it is marked by the sacrifice of an animal (usually a chicken). In January 2018, Algeria declared Yennayer a national holiday \u2013 a landmark policy considering how the Amazigh are marginalized in Northern Africa.[6]\nA characteristic trait of this festivity, which often blurs with the Islamic Day of Ashura, is the presence, in many regions, of ritual invocations with formulas like bennayu, babiyyanu, bu-ini, etc. Such expressions, according to many scholars, may be derived from the ancient bonus annus (happy new year) wishes.[7]\nA curious aspect of the Yennayer celebrations concerns the date of New Year's Day. Though once this anniversary fell everywhere on 14 January,[8] because of a likely mistake introduced by some Berber cultural associations very active in recovering customs on the verge of extinction, at present in a wide part of Algeria it is common opinion that the date of \"Berber New Year's Day\" is 12 January and not the 14th. Previously the celebration at the 12, two days before the traditional one, it had been explicitly signaled in the city of Oran.[9]\nBefore the cold ends completely and spring begins fully, there is a period of the year that is very feared. It consists of ten days straddling the months of furar and mars (the last five of the former and the first five of the latter), and it is characterised by strong winds. It is said that, during this term, one should suspend many activities (agricultural and artisan), should not marry nor go out during the night, leaving instead full scope to mysterious powers, which in that period are particularly active and celebrate their weddings. Due to a linguistic taboo, in Djerba these creatures are called imbarken, i.e. \"the blessed ones\", whence this period takes its name.\nJamrat el Ma (Arabic: \u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621), \"embers of the sea\", 27 February, is marked by a rise in sea temperature.[10]\nJamrat el Trab (Arabic: \u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0628), \"land embers\" in English, is the period from 6 to 10 March and known to be marked by a mixture of heavy rain and sunny weather. The term jamrat (literally 'coal') is in reference to the warm state of the earth during this period .[11]\nLike the strong winter cold, the Dog Days also last 40 days, from 12 yulyuz (25 July) to 20 ghusht (2 September). The apical moment of the period is the first of ghusht \"August\" (also the name awussu, widespread in Tunisia and Libya, seems to date back to Latin augustus). On this date, particular rites are performed, which manifestly derive from pre-Islamic, and even pre-Christian, traditions. They consist, in particular, of bonfires (which in many locations take place around the summer solstice: a custom already condemned as Pagan by St. Augustine), or water rituals, like those, common in the coastal towns of Tunisia and Tripolitania, that provide to dive in the seawaters for three nights, in order to preserve one's health. In these ceremonies, whole families used to enter the water, bringing with them even their pets. Though the rite has been revisited in an Islamic frame (in those nights, the water of the Zamzam Well, in Mecca, would spill over, and in the sea there would be beneficial sweet water waves), many call this celebration \"the nights of the error\". It was in fact usual that, in order to achieve fertility and prosperity, men and women copulated among the flucts.\nAnother important period for the agricultural calendar is that of the ploughing. In this context, a date considered fundamental is the 17th of (k)tuber, in which one may start ploughing his fields. In Arabic, this period is called \u1e25ertadem, that is \"Adam's ploughing\", because in that date the common ancestor of humanity is said to have begun his agricultural works.\nFollowing centuries-long contacts with the Arab-Islamic culture, the celebrations linked to the Julian calendar have been sometimes integrated into the Islamic calendar, leading to the suppression of some traditional holidays or to the creation of duplicates.\nThe most evident example are the celebrations for the new year, which in many cases have been transferred to the first Islamic month, i.e. Mu\u1e25arram, and more precisely to the \u02bf\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019, which falls on the 10th day of that month. This holiday has an important mournful meaning in the Shia Islam, but it is substantially ignored among Sunnis. Many studies have shown the relationships between the joyful celebration of this holiday in North Africa and the ancient New Year's Day celebrations.\nNot much is known about the division of time among the ancient Berbers. Some elements of a pre-Islamic, and almost certainly a pre-Roman calendar, emerge from some medieval writings, analyzed by Nico van den Boogert. Some correspondences with the traditional Tuareg calendar suggest that in antiquity there existed, with some degree of diffusion, a Berber time computation, organized on native bases.\nThere are not enough elements to reconstruct this calendar fully, but known characteristics include many month names' appearing in couples (in the Tuareg world, even in triplets), which suggests a time division different from the present one, made up of months of about 30 days.\nSome further information, although difficult to specify and correlate with the situation in the rest of North Africa, may be deduced from what is known about time computation among the Guanches of the Canary Islands. According to a 17th-century manuscript by Tom\u00e1s Mar\u00edn de Cubas, they\ncomputed their year, called Acano, by lunations of 29 days (suns) beginning from the new moon. It began in summer, when the sun enters in Cancer, on June 21: at the first conjunction (at the first new moon after the Summer solstice) they celebrated nine festival days for the crop.[13]\nThe same manuscript states (although somewhat obscurely) that graphical-pictorical records of such calendarial events (tara) were made on different supports, and on this basis some modern scholars identified alleged descriptions of astronomical events connected to annual cycles in a series of geometric paintings in some caves of Gran Canaria island, but the results of these studies are for now highly speculative.[14][15]\nThe name of only one month is known in the native language, handed down as Be\u00f1esmet. It seems it was the second month of the year, corresponding to August. Such a name, in case it was made up by something like *wen \"that of\" + (e)smet (or (e)zmet?), may correspond, in the list of medieval Berber month names, with the ninth and tenth months, awzimet (properly aw \"baby of\" + zimet \"gazelle\"). But data are too scarce for this hypothesis to be deepened.[12]\nThe traditional Berber calendar was not linked to an era with respect to which years were calculated. Where traditional ways to compute the years have been preserved (Tuareg civilization), years are not expressed with numbers but each of them has a name characterizing it.\nStarting from the 1960s, however, on the initiative of the Acad\u00e9mie Berb\u00e8re of Paris, some Berbers have begun computing the years starting from 950 BC, the approximate date of the rising into power of the first Libyan Pharaoh in Egypt, Shoshenq I, whom they identified as the first prominent Berber in history (he is recorded as being of Libyan origin).[16] For example, the Gregorian year 2023 corresponds to the 2973rd year of the Berber calendar.\nThis innovation has been adopted with conviction by many supporters of the Berber culture and is now a part of the cultural heritage of this people, fully integrated in the system of traditional customs related the North-African calendar.[citation needed]\nPhoto taken on 31 December 2007 near Tafraout (Morocco), with the writings aseggas ameggaz (\"good year\") in Tifinagh and bonne ann\u00e9e 2959 (\"good year 2959\") in French. Note the 1-year mistake, as 2959 corresponds to the Gregorian year 2009.\n^The etymology proposed for bu-ini of Aures from Masqueray (1886: 164), was welcomed and extended to other similar terms related to the start of the year festivities by several authors, including Doutt\u00e9 (1909: 550), Laoust (1920: 195), Delheure (1988: 156). Drouin (2000: 115) defines these etymological research as \"unconvincing\".\n^\"In Oran the Ennayer parties are made on 11 and 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, that is two days before the common agricultural calendar ...\" Mohamed Benhadji Serradj, F\u00eates d'Enn\u00e2yer aux Beni snus (tlemc\u00e9nien folklore) in IBLA, vol. 1950, pp. 247-258.",

        "context": "\nRamadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard \u02f9to distinguish between right and wrong\u02fa. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or on a journey, then \u02f9let them fast\u02fa an equal number of days \u02f9after Rama\u1e0d\u00e2n\u02fa. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.\nAccording to Al-Bukhari, Muhmmad initially chose the date of the fast as the day of Ashura (the 10th day of the 1st month), probably the JewishYom Kippur.[51] This fast was later replaced with the fast of the 9th month (Ramadan).[52]\nRamadan beginning dates between Gregorian years 1938 and 2038; including an error on the ante-penultimate line. This table is based on an unspecified variant of the Islamic calendar and that, according to local practices, there can be differences of one (or even two) days.\nBecause the Hil\u0101l, or crescent moon, typically occurs approximately one day after the new moon, Muslims can usually estimate the beginning of Ramadan;[53] however, many[who?] prefer to confirm the opening of Ramadan by direct visual observation of the crescent.[54]\nQadr Night is considered the holiest night of the year.[55][56] It is generally believed to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan; the Dawoodi Bohra believe that Laylat al-Qadr was the twenty-third night of Ramadan.[57][58]\nThe holiday of Eid al-Fitr (Arabic: \u0639\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0637\u0631), which marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Shawwal,[59] the next lunar month, is declared after a crescent new moon has been sighted or after completion of thirty days of fasting if no sighting of the moon is possible. Eid celebrates the return to a more natural disposition (fitra) of eating, drinking, and marital intimacy.[60]\nThe common practice is to fast from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the suhur, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is called iftar.[61]\nMuslims devote more time to prayer and acts of charity, striving to improve their self-discipline, motivated by hadith:[62][63] \"When Ramadan arrives, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of hell are locked up and devils are put in chains.\"[64]\nRamadan is a time of spiritual reflection, self-improvement, and heightened devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (sawm) begins at dawn and ends at sunset. In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking during this time, Muslims abstain from sexual relations[3] and sinful speech and behaviour during Ramadan fasting or month. The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, its purpose being to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Muslims believe that Ramadan teaches them to practice self-discipline, self-control,[65] sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate, thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity (zakat).[66] Muslims also believe fasting helps instill compassion for the food-insecure poor.\nExemptions from fasting include those traveling, menstruating, severely ill, pregnant, or breastfeeding. However, Muslims in these categories may still choose to fast, in order to satisfy their spiritual needs, even though it is not recommended by hadith.[61] Those unable to fast are obligated to make up the missed days later.[67]\nAt sunset, families break the fast with the iftar, traditionally opening the meal by eating dates to commemorate Muhammad's practice of breaking the fast with three dates.[70][71] They then adjourn for Maghrib, the fourth of the five required daily prayers, after which the main meal is served.[72]\nSocial gatherings, many times in buffet style, are frequent at iftar. Traditional dishes are often highlighted, including traditional desserts, particularly those made only during Ramadan.[example needed] Water is usually the beverage of choice, but juice and milk are also often available, as are soft drinks and caffeinated beverages.[73]\nIn the Middle East, iftar consists of water, juices, dates, salads and appetizers; one or more main dishes; and rich desserts, with dessert considered the most important aspect of the meal.[74] Typical main dishes include lamb stewed with wheat berries, lamb kebabs with grilled vegetables, and roasted chicken served with chickpea-studded rice pilaf. Desserts may include luqaimat, baklava or kunafeh.[75]\nZakat, often translated as \"the poor-rate\", is the fixed percentage of income a believer is required to give to the poor; the practice is obligatory as one of the pillars of Islam. Muslims believe that good deeds are rewarded more handsomely during Ramadan than at any other time of the year; consequently, many Muslims donate a larger portion \u2013 or even all \u2013 of their yearly zak\u0101t during this month.[citation needed]\nTarawih (Arabic: \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a\u062d) are extra nightly prayers performed during the month of Ramadan. Contrary to popular belief, they are not compulsory.[78]\nMuslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran, which comprises thirty juz' (sections), over the thirty days of Ramadan. Some Muslims incorporate a recitation of one juz' into each of the thirty tarawih sessions observed during the month.[citation needed]\nOn the island of Java, many believers bathe in holy springs to prepare for fasting, a ritual known as Padusan.[83] The city of Semarang marks the beginning of Ramadan with the Dugderan carnival, which involves parading the warak ngendog, a horse-dragon hybrid creature allegedly inspired by the Buraq.[84] In the Chinese-influenced capital city of Jakarta, firecrackers are widely used to celebrate Ramadan, although they are officially illegal.[85] Towards the end of Ramadan, most employees receive a one-month bonus known as Tunjangan Hari Raya.[86] Certain kinds of food are especially popular during Ramadan, such as large beef or buffalo in Aceh and snails in Central Java.[87] The iftar meal is announced every evening by striking the bedug, a giant drum, in the mosque.[88]\nCommon greetings during Ramadan include Ramadan mubarak and Ramadan kareem, which mean (have a) \"blessed Ramadan\" and \"generous Ramadan\" respectively.[89]\nDuring Ramadan in the Middle East, a mesaharati beats a drum across a neighbourhood to wake people up to eat the suhoor meal. Similarly in Southeast Asia, the kentonganslit drum is used for the same purpose.\nIn some countries, on the contrary, the observance of Ramadan has been restricted by governments. In the USSR, the practice of Ramadan was suppressed by officials.[105][106] In Albania, Ramadan festivities were banned during the communist period.[107] However, many Albanians continued to fast secretly during this period.[108]\nSome countries impose modified work schedules. In the UAE, employees may work no more than six hours per day and thirty-six hours per week. Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait have similar laws.[118]\nThere are various health effects of fasting in Ramadan. Ramadan fasting is considered safe for healthy individuals; it may pose risks for individuals with certain pre-existing conditions. Most Islamic scholars hold that fasting is not required for those who are ill. Additionally, the elderly and pre-pubertal children are exempt from fasting.[119] Pregnant or lactating women are also exempt from fasting during Ramadan.[120] There are known health risks involved in pregnant women who fast, which include the potential of induced labour and gestational diabetes.[121][122][123][124][125]\nThere are some health benefits of fasting in Ramadan including increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing insulin resistance.[126] It has also been shown that there is a significant improvement in 10 years coronary heart disease risk score and other cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids profile, systolic blood pressure, weight, BMI and waist circumference in subjects with a previous history of cardiovascular disease.[127] The fasting period is usually associated with modest weight loss, but weight can return afterwards.[128]\nIn many cultures, it is associated with heavy food and water intake during Suhur and Iftar times, which may do more harm than good.[129] Ramadan fasting is safe for healthy people provided that overall food and water intake is adequate but those with medical conditions should seek medical advice if they encounter health problems before or during fasting.[130]\nThe education departments of Berlin and the United Kingdom have tried to discourage students from fasting during Ramadan, as they claim that not eating or drinking can lead to concentration problems and bad grades.[131][132]\nConversion of Hijri years 1343 to 1500 to the Gregorian calendar, with first days of al-Muharram (brown), Ramadan (grey) and Shawwal (black) bolded, and Eid al-Adha dotted \u2013 in the SVG file, hover over a spot to show its dates and a line to show the month\nA study on 55 professional Algerian soccer players showed that performance during Ramadan declined significantly for speed, agility, dribbling speed and endurance, and most stayed low 2 weeks after the conclusion of Ramadan.[134]\nThe length of the dawn to sunset time varies in different parts of the world according to summer or winter solstices of the Sun. Most Muslims fast for eleven to sixteen hours during Ramadan. However, in polar regions, the period between dawn and sunset may exceed twenty-two hours in summer. For example, in 2014, Muslims in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Trondheim, Norway, fasted almost twenty-two hours, while Muslims in Sydney, Australia, fasted for only about eleven hours. In areas characterized by continuous night or day, some Muslims follow the fasting schedule observed in the nearest city that experiences sunrise and sunset, while others follow Mecca time.[19][20][21]\nAs sunrise and sunset occur sixteen times each a day in low-Earth orbit, Muslim astronauts in space schedule religious practices around the time zone of the last place on Earth they were on. For example, this means an astronaut from Malaysia launching from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida would center their fast according to sunrise and sunset times in Cape Canaveral, in Florida's Eastern Time. This includes times for daily prayers, as well as sunset and sunrise for Ramadan.[135][136]\nMuslims continue to work during Ramadan;[137][138] however, in some countries, such as Oman and Lebanon, working hours are shortened.[139][140] It is often recommended that working Muslims inform their employers if they are fasting, given the potential for the observance to impact performance at work.[141] The extent to which Ramadan observers are protected by religious accommodation varies by country. Policies putting them at a disadvantage compared to other employees have been met with discrimination claims in the United Kingdom and the United States.[142][143][144] An Arab News article reported that Saudi Arabian businesses were unhappy with shorter working hours during Ramadan, some reporting a decline in productivity of 35\u201350%.[145] The Saudi businesses proposed awarding salary bonuses in order to incentivize longer hours.[146] Despite the reduction in productivity, merchants can enjoy higher profit margins in Ramadan due to increase in demand.[147]",

        "context": "\nThe history of macOS, Apple's current Macoperating system formerly named Mac OS X until 2011 and then OS X until 2016, began with the company's project to replace its \"classic\" Mac OS. That system, up to and including its final release Mac OS 9, was a direct descendant of the operating system Apple had used in its Mac computers since their introduction in 1984. However, the current macOS is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT from the 1980s until Apple purchased the company in early 1997.[1]\nAlthough it was originally marketed as simply \"version 10\" of Mac OS (indicated by the Roman numeral \"X\"), it has a completely different codebase from Mac OS 9, as well as substantial changes to its user interface. The transition was a technologically and strategically significant one. To ease the transition for users and developers, versions through 10.4 were able to run Mac OS 9 and its applications in the Classic Environment, a compatibility layer.\nmacOS was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0. It was built using the technologies Apple acquired from NeXT, but did not include the signature Aqua user interface (UI). The desktop version aimed at regular users\u2014Mac OS X 10.0\u2014shipped in March 2001. Since then, several more distinct desktop and server editions of macOS have been released. Starting with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, macOS Server is no longer offered as a standalone operating system; instead, server management tools are available for purchase as an add-on. The macOS Server app was discontinued on April 21, 2022 and will stop working on macOS 13 Ventura or later. Starting with the Intel build of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, most releases have been certified as Unix systems conforming to the Single UNIX Specification.[2][3][4][5][6]\nLion was referred to by Apple as \"Mac OS X Lion\" and sometimes as \"OS X Lion\"; Mountain Lion was officially referred to as just \"OS X Mountain Lion\", with the \"Mac\" being completely dropped. The operating system was further renamed to \"macOS\" starting with macOS Sierra.\nFrom the introduction of machines not supporting the classic Mac OS in 2003 until the introduction of iPhone OS in early 2007, Mac OS X was Apple's only software platform.\nmacOS retained the major version number 10 throughout its development history until the release of macOS 11 Big Sur in 2020.\nMac OS X 10.0 and 10.1 were given names of big cats as internal code names (\"Cheetah\" and \"Puma\"). Starting with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, big cat names were used as marketing names; starting with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, names of locations in California were used as marketing names instead.\nThe current major version, macOS 14 Sonoma, was announced on June 5, 2023 at WWDC 2023 and released on September 26 of that year.\nIt was updated to macOS 14.1 Sonoma on the 2nd of November that same year.\nA diagram of the relationships between Unix systems including the ancestors of macOS\nAfter Apple removed Steve Jobs from management in 1985, he left the company and attempted to create the \"next big thing\", with funding from Ross Perot[7] and himself. The result was the NeXT Computer. As the first workstation to include a digital signal processor (DSP) and a high-capacity optical disc drive, NeXT hardware was advanced for its time, but was expensive relative to the rapidly commoditizing workstation market. The hardware was phased out in 1993; however, the company's object-oriented operating systemNeXTSTEP had a more lasting legacy as it eventually became the basis for Mac OS X.\nAll but abandoning the idea of an operating system, NeXT managed to maintain a business selling WebObjects and consulting services, only ever making modest profits in its last few quarters as an independent company. NeXTSTEP underwent an evolution into OPENSTEP which separated the object layers from the operating system below, allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms. OPENSTEP was, for a short time, adopted by Sun and HP.\nHowever, by this point, a number of other companies \u2014 notably Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and even Sun itself \u2014 were claiming they would soon be releasing similar object-oriented operating systems and development tools of their own. Some of these efforts, such as Taligent, did not fully come to fruition; others, like Java, gained widespread adoption.[citation needed]\nOn February 4, 1997, Apple Computer acquired NeXT for $427 million, and used OPENSTEP as the basis for Mac OS X, as it was called at the time.[9] Traces of the NeXT software heritage can still be seen in macOS. For example, in the Cocoa development environment, the Objective-C library classes have \"NS\" prefixes, and the HISTORY section of the manual page for the defaults command in macOS straightforwardly states that the command \"First appeared in NeXTStep.\"[citation needed]\nMeanwhile, Apple was facing commercial difficulties of its own. The decade-old Macintosh System Software had reached the limits of its single-user, co-operative multitasking architecture, and its once-innovative user interface was looking increasingly outdated. A massive development effort to replace it, known as Copland, was started in 1994, but was generally perceived outside Apple to be a hopeless case due to political infighting and conflicting goals. By 1996, Copland was nowhere near ready for release, and the project was eventually cancelled. Some elements of Copland were incorporated into Mac OS 8, released on July 26, 1997.\nAfter considering the purchase of BeOS \u2014 a multimedia-enabled, multi-tasking OS designed for hardware similar to Apple's, the company decided instead to acquire NeXT and use OPENSTEP as the basis for their new OS. Avie Tevanian took over OS development, and Steve Jobs was brought on as a consultant. At first, the plan was to develop a new operating system based almost entirely on an updated version of OPENSTEP, with the addition of a virtual machine subsystem \u2014 known as the Blue Box \u2014 for running \"classic\" Macintosh applications. The result was known by the code name Rhapsody, slated for release in late 1998.\nApple expected that developers would port their software to the considerably more powerful OPENSTEP libraries once they learned of its power and flexibility. Instead, several major developers such as Adobe told Apple that this would never occur, and that they would rather leave the platform entirely. This \"rejection\" of Apple's plan was largely the result of a string of previous broken promises from Apple; after watching one \"next OS\" after another disappear and Apple's market share dwindle, developers were not interested in doing much work on the platform at all, let alone a re-write.\nApple's financial losses continued and the board of directors lost confidence in CEO Gil Amelio, asking him to resign. The board asked Steve Jobs to lead the company on an interim basis, essentially giving him carte blanche to make changes to return the company to profitability. When Jobs announced at the World Wide Developer's Conference that what developers really wanted was a modern version of the Mac OS, and Apple was going to deliver it[citation needed], he was met with applause.\nOver the next two years, a major effort was applied to porting the original Macintosh API to Unix libraries known as Carbon. Mac OS applications could be ported to Carbon without the need for a complete re-write, making them operate as native applications on the new operating system. Meanwhile, applications written using the older toolkits would be supported using the \"Classic\" Mac OS 9 environment. Support for C, C++, Objective-C, Java, and Python were added, furthering developer comfort with the new platform.[citation needed]\nDuring this time, the lower layers of the operating system (the Mach kernel and the BSD layers on top of it[10]) were re-packaged and released under the Apple Public Source License. They became known as Darwin. The Darwin kernel provides a stable and flexible operating system, which takes advantage of the contributions of programmers and independent open-source projects outside Apple; however, it sees little use outside the Macintosh community.[citation needed]\nDuring this period, the Java programming language had increased in popularity, and an effort was started to improve Mac Java support. This consisted of porting a high-speed Java virtual machine to the platform, and exposing macOS-specific \"Cocoa\" APIs to the Java language.[citation needed]\nThe first release of the new OS \u2014 Mac OS X Server 1.0 \u2014 used a modified version of the Mac OS GUI, but all client versions starting with Mac OS X Developer Preview 3 used a new theme known as Aqua. Aqua was a substantial departure from the Mac OS 9 interface, which had evolved with little change from that of the original Macintosh operating system: it incorporated full color scalable graphics, anti-aliasing of text and graphics, simulated shading and highlights, transparency and shadows, and animation. A new feature was the Dock, an application launcher which took advantage of these capabilities.\nDespite this, Mac OS X maintained a substantial degree of consistency with the traditional Mac OS interface and Apple's own Apple Human Interface Guidelines, with its pull-down menu at the top of the screen, familiar keyboard shortcuts, and support for a single-button mouse. The development of Aqua was delayed somewhat by the switch from OpenStep's Display PostScript engine to one developed in-house that was free of any license restrictions, known as Quartz.[citation needed]\nAfter the code name \"Jaguar\" for version 10.2 received publicity in the media, Apple began openly using the names to promote the operating system: 10.3 was marketed as \"Panther\", 10.4 as \"Tiger\", 10.5 as \"Leopard\", 10.6 as \"Snow Leopard\", 10.7 as \"Lion\", and 10.8 as \"Mountain Lion\". \"Panther\", \"Tiger\", and \"Leopard\" were registered as trademarks.\nIn 2016, OS X was renamed to macOS. A few years later, in 2020, with the release of macOS Big Sur, the first component of the version number was incremented from 10 to 11, so Big Sur's initial release's version number was 11.0 instead of 10.16, making the version numbers of macOS behave the way the version numbers of Apple's other operating systems do.[35] All subsequent major releases also increased the first component of the version number.\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95[36] \"preview\" version of Mac OS X (internally codenamed Kodiak) in order to gain feedback from users.[37] It marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface, and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in spring 2001.[38]\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).[39]\nThe initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.\nMac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released on September 25, 2001.[40]\nIt has better performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users. Apple released a US$129 upgrade CD for Mac OS 9.\nOn January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[41]\nOn August 23, 2002,[42]\nApple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.[43]\nIt brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple[44]\n), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATIRadeon or NvidiaGeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16 MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[45]\nThe Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X 10.2.\nOn January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel x86-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.[48] 10.4.4 introduced Rosetta, which translated 32-bit PowerPC machine code to 32-bit x86 code, allowing applications for PowerPC to run on Intel-based Macs without modification.\nOnly PowerPC Macs can be booted from retail copies of the Tiger client DVD, but there is a Universal DVD of Tiger Server 10.4.7 (8K1079) that can boot both PowerPC and Intel Macs.\nMac OS X Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. Apple called it \"the largest update of Mac OS X\". Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for Macs with the G3 processor was dropped, and Macs with the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867 MHz and at least 512 MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed,[49] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features.\nLeopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.[2][50] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications,[51] and was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.\nMac OS X Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009, the last version to be available on disc. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, the development of Snow Leopard was deliberately focused on \"under the hood\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes are these: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean installation compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser.[52]\nAn update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications and subsequent macOS upgrades.[52] Snow Leopard only supports Macs with Intel CPUs, requires at least 1 GB of RAM, and drops default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta can be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[53]\nMac OS X Lion (also known as OS X Lion) was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications (Launchpad) and (a greater use of) multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incapable of running PowerPC applications. It dropped support for 32-bit Intel processors and requires 2GB of memory. Changes made to the GUI (Graphical User Interface) include the Launchpad (similar to the home screen of iOS and iPadOS devices), auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control, which unifies Expos\u00e9, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[54]\nApple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed (similar to iOS). Documents auto-save by default.\nOS X Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud. 2GB of memory is required.[55] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features, including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine.[56]Notification Center is added, providing an overview of alerts from applications. Notes is added, as an application separate from Mail, synching with its iOS counterpart[57][58] through the iCloud service. Messages, an instant messagingsoftware application,[59] replaces iChat.[60]\nOS X Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013, as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide.[61]\nIt placed emphasis on battery life, Finder enhancements, other enhancements for power users, and continued iCloud integration, as well as bringing more of Apple's iOS apps to the OS X platform. iBooks and Apple Maps applications were added. Mavericks requires 2GB of memory to operate. It is the first version named under Apple's then-new theme of places in California, dubbed Mavericks after the surfing location.[62][63] Unlike previous versions of OS X, which had progressively decreasing prices since 10.6, 10.9 was available at no charge to all users of compatible systems running Snow Leopard (10.6) or later,[64] beginning Apple's policy of free upgrades for life on its operating system and business software.[65]\nOS X Yosemite was released to the general public on October 16, 2014, as a free update through the Mac App Store worldwide. It featured a major overhaul of user interface, replaced skeuomorphism with flat graphic design and blurred translucency effects, following the aesthetic introduced with iOS 7. It introduced features called Continuity and Handoff, which allow for tighter integration between paired OS X and iOS devices: the user can handle phone calls or text messages on either their Mac or their iPhone, and edit the same Pages document on either their Mac or their iPad. A later update of the OS included Photos as a replacement for iPhoto and Aperture.[citation needed]\nOS X El Capitan was revealed on June 8, 2015, during the WWDC15 keynote speech.[66] It was made available as a public beta in July and was made available publicly on September 30, 2015. Apple described this release as containing \"Refinements to the Mac Experience\" and \"Improvements to System Performance\" rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, as well as adopting San Francisco as the system font. Metal API, an application enhancing software, had debuted in this operating system, being available to \"all Macs since 2012\".[67]\nmacOS Sierra was announced on June 13, 2016, during the WWDC16 keynote speech. The update brought the Siri assistant to macOS, featuring several Mac-specific features, like searching for files. It also allowed websites to support Apple Pay as a method of transferring payment, using either a nearby iOS device or Touch ID to authenticate. iCloud also received several improvements, such as the ability to store a user's Desktop and Documents folders on iCloud so they could be synced with other Macs on the same Apple ID. It was released publicly on September 20, 2016.[68]\nmacOS High Sierra was announced on June 5, 2017, during the WWDC17 keynote speech. It was released on September 25, 2017. The release includes many under-the-hood improvements, including a switch to Apple File System (APFS), the introduction of Metal 2, support for HEVC video, and improvements to VR support. In addition, numerous changes were made to standard applications including Photos, Safari, Notes, and Spotlight.[69]\nmacOS Mojave was announced on June 4, 2018, during the WWDC18 keynote speech. It was released on September 24, 2018. Some of the key new features were Dark wallpaper in dark mode, Desktop stacks and Dynamic Desktop, which changes the desktop background image to correspond to the user's current time of day.[70]\nmacOS Catalina was announced on June 3, 2019, during the WWDC19 keynote speech. It was released on October 7, 2019. It primarily focuses on updates to built-in apps, such as replacing iTunes with separate Music, Podcasts, and TV apps, redesigned Reminders and Books apps, and a new Find My app. It also features Sidecar, which allows the user to use an iPad as a second screen for their computer, or even simulate a graphics tablet with an Apple Pencil. It is the first version of macOS not to support 32-bit applications. The Dashboard application was also removed in the update.[71][72] Since macOS Catalina, iOS apps can run on macOS with Project Catalyst but requires the app to be made compatible[73] unlike ARM-powered Apple silicon Macs that can run all iOS apps by default.[74]\nmacOS Big Sur was announced on June 22, 2020, during the WWDC20 keynote speech.[75] It was released November 12, 2020.[76] The major version number is changed, for the first time since \"Mac OS X\" was released, making it macOS 11. It brings ARM support, new icons, GUI changes to the system,[77] and other bug fixes.\nSince macOS 11.2.3, it is no longer possible to install iOS apps by default from an IPA file instead of the Mac App Store on Apple silicon Macs, which now requires third-party software to unlock the functionality.[78][79] Big Sur introduced Rosetta 2 to allow 64-bit Intel applications to run on Apple silicon Macs. However, Intel-based Macs are unable to run ARM-based applications, including iOS and iPadOS apps.\nmacOS Monterey was announced on June 7, 2021, during the WWDC21 keynote speech.[80] It was released on October 25, 2021.[81] macOS Monterey introduces new features such as Universal Control, which allows users to use a single keyboard and mouse to move between devices; AirPlay, which now allows users to present and share almost anything; the Shortcuts app, also introduced to macOS, gives users access to galleries of pre-built shortcuts, designed for Macs, a service brought from iOS, and users can now also set up shortcuts, among other things.[82] macOS Monterey is the final version of macOS that officially supports macOS Server.\nmacOS Ventura was announced on June 6, 2022, during the WWDC22 keynote speech.[83] It was released on October 24, 2022.[84] macOS Ventura introduces Stage Manager, a new and optional window manager, a redesigned settings app, and Continuity Camera, which is a program that allows Mac users to use their iPhone as a camera, and several other new features.[83] It is also the first version of macOS without macOS Server support.\nmacOS Sonoma was announced on June 5, 2023, during the WWDC23 keynote speech. Key changes include a revamp of Widgets, the user lock screen, and a video wallpaper/screensaver feature using Apple TV's screen saver videos.[85] It was released on September 26, 2023.[86]\n^Trademark #78257226 for Panther, #78269988 for Tiger, #78270003 for Leopard, #78271630 for Cougar and #78271639 for Lynx, all registered in 2004 by Apple Computer, Inc.\n\"United States Patent and Trademark Office\".

        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_exoplanets#:~:text=5%2C539%20confirmed%20exoplanets",
        "effective_year": "2023",
        "context": "\nThe convention for naming exoplanets is an extension of the system used for designating multiple-star systems as adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). For exoplanets orbiting a single star, the IAU designation is formed by taking the designated or proper name of its parent star, and adding a lower case letter.[3] Letters are given in order of each planet's discovery around the parent star, so that the first planet discovered in a system is designated \"b\" (the parent star is considered \"a\") and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the designation of circumbinary planets. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.\nPlanets are extremely faint compared to their parent stars. For example, a Sun-like star is about a billion times brighter than the reflected light from any exoplanet orbiting it. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore, the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge which requires extreme optothermal stability.[4] All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than Jupiter) and widely separated from their parent stars.\nSpecially designed direct-imaging instruments such as Gemini Planet Imager, VLT-SPHERE, and SCExAO will image dozens of gas giants, but the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods.\nWhen the star is behind a planet, its brightness will seem to dimIf a planet crosses (or transits) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other factors. Because the transit method requires that the planet's orbit intersect a line-of-sight between the host star and Earth, the probability that an exoplanet in a randomly oriented orbit will be observed to transit the star is somewhat small. The Kepler telescope used this method.\nAs a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocity\u2014that is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from Earth\u2014can be detected from displacements in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. Extremely small radial-velocity variations can be observed, of 1 m/s or even somewhat less.[6]\nWhen multiple planets are present, each one slightly perturbs the others' orbits. Small variations in the times of transit for one planet can thus indicate the presence of another planet, which itself may or may not transit. For example, variations in the transits of the planet Kepler-19b suggest the existence of a second planet in the system, the non-transiting Kepler-19c.[7][8]\nWhen a planet orbits multiple stars or if the planet has moons, its transit time can significantly vary per transit. Although no new planets or moons have been discovered with this method, it is used to successfully confirm many transiting circumbinary planets.[9]\nMicrolensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing star can cause detectable anomalies in magnification as it varies over time. Unlike most other methods which have a detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, the microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1\u201310 AU away from Sun-like stars.\nAstrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky and observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion is so small, however, this method has not yet been very productive. It has produced only a few disputed detections, though it has been successfully used to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.\nA pulsar (the small, ultradense remnant of a star that has exploded as a supernova) emits radio waves extremely regularly as it rotates. If planets orbit the pulsar, they will cause slight anomalies in the timing of its observed radio pulses. The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.\nLike pulsars, there are some other types of stars which exhibit periodic activity. Deviations from periodicity can sometimes be caused by a planet orbiting it. As of 2013, a few planets have been discovered with this method.[10]\nWhen a planet orbits very close to a star, it catches a considerable amount of starlight. As the planet orbits the star, the amount of light changes due to planets having phases from Earth's viewpoint or planets glowing more from one side than the other due to temperature differences.[11]\nWith the polarimetry method, a polarized light reflected off the planet is separated from unpolarized light emitted from the star. No new planets have been discovered with this method, although a few already discovered planets have been detected with this method.[14][15]\nDisks of space dust surround many stars, thought to originate from collisions among asteroids and comets. The dust can be detected because it absorbs starlight and re-emits it as infrared radiation. Features on the disks may suggest the presence of planets, though this is not considered a definitive detection method.",

        "context": "\nNew England and Virginia colonists originally celebrated days of fasting, as well as days of thanksgiving, thanking God for blessings such as harvests, ship landings, military victories, or the end of a drought.[4] These were observed through church services, accompanied with feasts and other communal gatherings.[3][b]\nThe event that Americans commonly call the \"first Thanksgiving\" was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in October 1621.[5] This feast lasted three days and was attended by 90 Native American Wampanoag people[6][c]\nand 53 survivors of the Mayflower (Pilgrims).[7] Less widely known is an earlier Thanksgiving celebration in Virginia in 1619 by English settlers who had just landed at Berkeley Hundred aboard the ship Margaret.[8]\nThanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, with a proclamation by President George Washington after a request by Congress.[9] President Thomas Jefferson chose not to observe the holiday, and its celebration was intermittent until President Abraham Lincoln, in 1863, proclaimed a national day of \"Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens\", calling on the American people to also, \"with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience ... fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation\". Lincoln declared it for the last Thursday in November.[10][11] On June 28, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Holidays Act that made Thanksgiving a yearly appointed federal holiday in Washington, D.C.[12][13][14] On January 6, 1885, an act by Congress made Thanksgiving, and other federal holidays, a paid holiday for all federal workers throughout the United States.[15] Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the date was moved to one week earlier, observed between 1939 and 1941 amid significant controversy. From 1942 onwards, Thanksgiving, by an act of Congress received a permanent observation date, the fourth Thursday in November, no longer at the discretion of the president.[16][17]\nShrine of the first U.S. Thanksgiving in 1619 at Berkeley Plantation in Charles City County, Virginia\nSetting aside time to give thanks for one's blessings, along with holding feasts to celebrate a harvest, are both practices that long predate the European settlement of North America. The Puritans observed days of fasting to pray for God's favor, as well as days of thanksgiving to thank God for a bountiful harvest, victory and other joyous occasions.[3] Documented thanksgiving services in territory currently belonging to the United States were conducted in the 16th century by Spaniards[18][19] and the French.[20] These days of thanksgiving were celebrated through church services and feasting.[3] Historian Michael Gannon claimed St. Augustine, Florida, was founded with a shared thanksgiving meal on September 8, 1565.[21]\nThanksgiving services were routine in what became the Commonwealth of Virginia as early as 1607;[22] the first permanent settlement of Jamestown, Virginia, held a thanksgiving in 1610.[18] On December 4, 1619, 38 English settlers celebrated a thanksgiving immediately upon landing at Berkeley Hundred in Charles City County, Virginia. The group's London Company charter specifically required \"that the day of our ships arrival at the place assigned for plantation in the land of Virginia shall be yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God\".[8][23] This celebration has, since the mid 20th century, been commemorated there annually at present-day Berkeley Plantation, the ancestral home of the Harrison family of Virginia.[24]\nThe Plymouth settlers, known as Pilgrims, had settled in a land abandoned when all but one of the Patuxet Indians died in a disease outbreak. After a harsh winter killed half of the Plymouth settlers, the last surviving Patuxet, Tisquantum, more commonly known by the diminutive variant Squanto (who had learned English and avoided the plague as a slave in Europe), came in at the request of Samoset, the first Native American to encounter the Pilgrims. Squanto taught the Pilgrims how to catch eel and grow corn and served as an interpreter for them until he too succumbed to the disease a year later. The Wampanoag leader Massasoit also gave food to the colonists during the first winter when supplies brought from England were insufficient. Massasoit had hoped to establish an alliance between the Wampanoag, themselves greatly weakened by the same plague that extirpated the Patuxet, and the better-armed English in their long-running rivalry with a Narragansett tribe that had largely been spared from the epidemic; the tribe reasoned that, given that the Pilgrims had brought women and children, they had not arrived to wage war against them.[26]\nThe Pilgrims celebrated at Plymouth for three days after their first harvest in 1621. The exact time is unknown, but James Baker, the Plimoth Plantation vice president of research, stated in 1996, \"The event occurred between Sept. 21 and Nov. 11, 1621, with the most likely time being around Michaelmas (Sept. 29), the traditional time.\"[27] Seventeenth-century accounts do not identify this as a Thanksgiving observance, rather it followed the harvest. It included 50 people who were on the Mayflower (all who remained of the 100 who had landed) and 90 Native Americans.[27] The feast was cooked by the four adult Pilgrim women who survived their first winter in the New World (Eleanor Billington, Elizabeth Hopkins, Mary Brewster, and Susanna White), along with young daughters and male and female servants.[27][28] According to accounts by Wampanoag descendants, the harvest was originally set up for the Pilgrims alone; the surviving natives, hearing celebratory gunfire and fearing war, arrived to see the feast and were warmly welcomed to join the celebration, contributing their own foods to the meal.[26]\nThe Puritan by Augustus St. Gaudens, 1904. The \"buckle hat\" atop the sculpture's head, now associated with the Pilgrims in pop culture, was fictional; Pilgrims never wore such an item, nor has any such hat ever existed as a serious piece of apparel.\nThey began now to gather in the small harvest they had, and to fit up their houses and dwellings against winter, being all well recovered in health and strength and had all things in good plenty. For as some were thus employed in affairs abroad, others were exercised in fishing, about cod and bass and other fish, of which they took good store, of which every family had their portion. All the summer there was no want; and now began to come in store of fowl, as winter approached, of which this place did abound when they can be used (but afterward decreased by degrees). And besides waterfowl, there was a great store of wild turkeys, of which they took many, besides venison, etc. Besides, they had about a peck a meal a week to a person, or now since harvest, Indian corn to the proportion. Which made many afterward write so largely of their plenty here to their friends in England, which were not feigned but true reports.[32]\nOur harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the fruits of our labor. They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company almost a week. At which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised our arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest their greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three days we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five deer, which we brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor, and upon the captain and others. And although it be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with us, yet by the goodness of God, we are so far from want that we often wish you, partakers of our plenty.[33]\nThe First Thanksgiving 1621, oil on canvas by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris (1899). The painting shows common misconceptions about the event which persist to modern times: Pilgrims did not wear such outfits, nor did they eat at a dinner table, and the Wampanoag are dressed in the style of Native Americans from the Great Plains.[34]\nThe Pilgrims held a true Thanksgiving celebration in 1623[35][36] following a fast[37] and a refreshing 14 day rain,[38] which resulted in a larger harvest. William DeLoss Love calculates that this thanksgiving was made on Wednesday, July 30, 1623, a day before the arrival of a supply ship with more colonists,[37] but before the fall harvest. In Love's opinion, this 1623 thanksgiving was significant because the order to recognize the event was from civil authority[39]\n(Governor Bradford), and not from the church, making it likely the first civil recognition of Thanksgiving in New England.[37]\nReferring to the 1623 harvest after the nearly catastrophic drought, Bradford wrote:\nAnd afterward, the Lord sent them such seasonable showers, with the interchange of fair warm weather as, through His blessing, caused a fruitful and liberal harvest, to their no small comfort and rejoicing. For which mercy, in time convenient, they also set apart a day of thanksgiving ... By this time harvest was come, and instead of famine now God gave them plenty ... for which they blessed God. And the effect of their particular planting was well seen, for all had ... pretty well ... so as any general want or famine had not been amongst them since to this day.[40]\nThese firsthand accounts do not appear to have contributed to the early development of the holiday. Bradford's \"Of Plymouth Plantation\" was not published until the 1850s. The booklet \"Mourt's Relation\" was summarized by other publications without the now-familiar thanksgiving story. By the eighteenth century, the original booklet appeared to be lost or forgotten; a copy was rediscovered in Philadelphia in 1820, with the first full reprinting in 1841. In a footnote the editor, Alexander Young, was the first person to identify the 1621 feast as the first Thanksgiving.[41]\nAccording to historian James Baker, debates over where any \"first Thanksgiving\" took place on modern American territory are a \"tempest in a beanpot\".[41] Jeremy Bang opines that, \"Local boosters in Virginia, Florida, and Texas promote their own colonists, who (like many people getting off a boat) gave thanks for setting foot again on dry land.\"[42] According to Baker, \"the American holiday's true origin was the New England Calvinist Thanksgiving. Never coupled with a Sabbath meeting, the Puritan observances were special days set aside during the week for thanksgiving and praise in response to God's providence.\"[41]\nPolitically, the 1619 codification and celebration of an annual thanksgiving according to the Berkeley Hundred charter in Virginia prompted President John F. Kennedy to acknowledge the claims of both Massachusetts and Virginia to America's earliest celebrations. He issued Proclamation 3560 on November 5, 1963, saying: \"Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massachusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of thanksgiving. On the appointed day, they gave reverent thanks for their safety, for the health of their children, for the fertility of their fields, for the love which bound them together and for the faith which united them with their God.\"[43]\nThe Wampanoag were collaboratively active in the first historical Thanksgiving dinner with the Pilgrims. Different accounts of the Thanksgiving meal exist from that the time. \"While the celebrants might well have feasted on wild turkey, the local diet also included fish, eels, shellfish, and a Wampanoag dish called nasaump, which the Pilgrims had adopted: boiled cornmeal mixed with vegetables and meats. There were no potatoes (an indigenous South American food not yet introduced into the global food system) and no pies (because there was no butter, wheat flour, or sugar).\".[44]\nThe Wampanoag tribe has aligned what they eat with tradition, nature, and time of the season.[45] Their farming and hunting techniques produced much of the dinner for the Pilgrims at the time, but they had a separate notion. Much of today's image and literary text promotes the idea that every party involved ate solely turkey.[46]\nThe First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving was given by the Continental Congress in 1777 from its temporary location in York, Pennsylvania, while the British occupied the national capital at Philadelphia. Delegate Samuel Adams created the first draft. Congress then adopted the final version:\nFor as much as it is the indispensable Duty of all Men to adore the superintending Providence of Almighty God; to acknowledge with Gratitude their Obligation to him for Benefits received, and to implore such farther Blessings as they stand in Need of: And it had pleased him in his abundant Mercy, not only to continue to us the innumerable Bounties of his common Providence; but also to smile upon us in the Prosecution of a just and necessary war, for the Defense and Establishment of our unalienable Rights and Liberties; particularly in that he hath been pleased, in so great a Measure, to prosper the Means used for the Support of our Troops, and to crown our Arms with most signal success:\nIt is therefore recommended to the legislative or executive Powers of these United States to set apart Thursday, the eighteenth Day of December next, for Solemn Thanksgiving and Praise: That at one Time and with one Voice, the good People may express the grateful Feelings of their Hearts, and consecrate themselves to the Service of their Divine Benefactor; and that, together with their sincere Acknowledgments and Offerings, they may join the penitent Confession of their manifold Sins, whereby they had forfeited every Favor; and their humble and earnest Supplication that it may please God through the Merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of Remembrance; That it may please him graciously to afford his Blessing on the Governments of these States respectively, and prosper the public Council of the whole: To inspire our Commanders, both by Land and Sea, and all under them, with that Wisdom and Fortitude which may render them fit Instruments, under the Providence of Almighty God, to secure for these United States, the greatest of all human Blessings, Independence and Peace: That it may please him, to prosper the Trade and Manufactures of the People, and the Labor of the Husbandman, that our Land may yield its Increase: To take Schools and Seminaries of Education, so necessary for cultivating the Principles of true Liberty, Virtue and Piety, under his nurturing Hand; and to prosper the Means of Religion, for the promotion and enlargement of that Kingdom, which consisteth \"in Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost.\nAnd it is further recommended, That servile Labor, and such Recreation, as, though at other Times innocent, may be unbecoming the Purpose of this Appointment, be omitted on so solemn an Occasion.[47]\nGeorge Washington, leader of the revolutionary forces in the American Revolutionary War, proclaimed a Thanksgiving in December 1777 as a victory celebration honoring the defeat of the British at Saratoga.[48]\nThe Continental Congress, the legislative body that governed the United States from 1774 to 1789, issued several \"national days of prayer, humiliation, and thanksgiving\",[49] a practice that was continued by presidents Washington and Adams under the Constitution, and has manifested itself in the established American observances of Thanksgiving and the National Day of Prayer today.[50] This proclamation was published in The Independent Gazetteer, or the Chronicle of Freedom, on November 5, 1782, the first being observed on November 28, 1782:\nBy the United States in Congress assembled,\nPROCLAMATION.\nIt being the indispensable duty of all nations, not only to offer up their supplications to Almighty God, the giver of all good, for His gracious assistance in a time of distress, but also in a solemn and public manner, to give Him praise for His goodness in general, and especially for great and signal interpositions of His Providence in their behalf; therefore, the United States in Congress assembled, taking into their consideration the many instances of Divine goodness to these States in the course of the important conflict, in which they have been so long engaged; the present happy and promising state of public affairs, and the events of the war in the course of the year now drawing to a close; particularly the harmony of the public Councils which is so necessary to the success of the public cause; the perfect union and good understanding which has hitherto subsisted between them and their allies, notwithstanding the artful and unwearied attempts of the common enemy to divide them; the success of the arms of the United States and those of their allies; and the acknowledgment of their Independence by another European power, whose friendship and commerce must be of great and lasting advantage to these States; Do hereby recommend it to the inhabitants of these States in general, to observe and request the several states to interpose their authority, in appointing and commanding the observation of THURSDAY the TWENTY-EIGHTH DAY OF NOVEMBER next as a day of SOLEMN THANKSGIVING to GOD for all His mercies; and they do further recommend to all ranks to testify their gratitude to God for His goodness by a cheerful obedience to His laws and by promoting, each in his station, and by his influence, the practice of true and undefiled religion, which is the great foundation of public prosperity and national happiness.\nDone in Congress at Philadelphia, the eleventh day of October, in the year of our LORD, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two, and of our Sovereignty and Independence, the seventh.\nOn Thursday, September 24, 1789, the first House of Representatives voted to recommend the First Amendment of the newly drafted Constitution to the states for ratification. The next day, Congressman Elias Boudinot from New Jersey proposed that the House and Senate jointly request of President Washington to proclaim a day of thanksgiving for \"the many signal favors of Almighty God\". Boudinot said he \"could not think of letting the session pass over without offering an opportunity to all the citizens of the United States of joining, with one voice, in returning to Almighty God their sincere thanks for the many blessings he had poured down upon them.\"[51]\nAs President, on October 3, 1789, George Washington made the following proclamation and created the first Thanksgiving Day designated by the national government of the United States of America:\nWhereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor, and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me \"to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.\"\nNow therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be. That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks, for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country previous to their becoming a Nation, for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his providence, which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war, for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed, for the peaceable and rational manner, in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted, for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed; and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.\nAnd also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually, to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed, to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shown kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord. To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and Us, and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.\nGiven under my hand at the City of New York the third day of October in the year of our Lord 1789.[52]\nOn January 1, 1795, Washington proclaimed a Thanksgiving Day to be observed on Thursday, February 19.\nThe affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist association, give me the highest satisfaction. My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents, & in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more & more pleasing.\nBelieving with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.\nI reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection & blessing of the common father and creator of man, and tender you for yourselves & your religious association, assurances of my high respect & esteem.\nJames Madison renewed the tradition in 1814, in response to resolutions of Congress, at the close of the War of 1812. Caleb Strong, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, declared the holiday in 1813, \"for a day of public thanksgiving and prayer\" for Thursday, November 25 of that year.[55]\nMadison also declared the holiday twice in 1815; however, neither of these was celebrated in autumn. In 1816, Governor Plumer of New Hampshire appointed Thursday, November 14 to be observed as a day of Public Thanksgiving and Governor Brooks of Massachusetts appointed Thursday, November 28 to be \"observed throughout that State as a day of Thanksgiving\".[56]\nA thanksgiving day was annually appointed by the governor of New York, De Witt Clinton, in 1817. In 1830, the New York State Legislature officially sanctioned thanksgiving as a holiday, making New York the first state outside of New England to do so.[57]\nIn 1846, Sara Josepha Hale began a campaign to make Thanksgiving a national holiday, to be held on the last Thursday in November. She wrote to presidents, members of Congress, and every governor of every state and territory for the next seventeen years to promote the idea, as well as popularizing it in her books and editorials. Hale hoped that Thanksgiving, as a national holiday, would foster the \"moral and social reunion of Americans\".[58] She also proposed that churches mark the holiday by collecting funds for the purchasing of slaves and their education and repatriation back to Africa.[58]\nBy 1860 proclamations appointing a day of thanksgiving were issued by the governors of thirty states and three territories.[58]\nThe year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, the order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax had enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. The population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years, with large increase of freedom.\nNo human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Highest God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.\nIt has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and voice by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to his tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility and Union.\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.\nSince 1863, Thanksgiving has been observed annually in the United States. The holiday superseded Evacuation Day, a de facto national holiday that had been held on November 25 each year prior to the Civil War and commemorated the British withdrawal from the United States after the American Revolution.[60]\n\"Uncle Sam's Thanksgiving Dinner: Come one come all Free and equal\" Thomas Nast cartoon promoting the passage of the 15th amendmentServicemen eating a Thanksgiving dinner after the end of World WarI (1918)\nOn June 28, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Holidays Act that made Thanksgiving a yearly \"appointed or remembered\" federal holiday in Washington D.C. Three other holidays included in the law were New Year, Christmas, and July 4. The law did not extend outside of Washington D.C., while the date assigned for Thanksgiving was left to the discretion of the President.[12][13][14] In January 1879, George Washington's Birthday, February 22, was added by Congress to the federal holidays list.[15] On January 6, 1885, a Congressional act expanded the Holidays Act to apply to all federal departments and employees throughout the nation. Federal workers received pay for all the holidays, including Thanksgiving.[15]\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, Thanksgiving traditions in America varied from region to region. A traditional New England Thanksgiving, for example, consisted of a raffle held on Thanksgiving Eve (in which the prizes were mainly geese or turkeys), a shooting match on Thanksgiving morning (in which turkeys and chickens were used as targets), church services \u2014 and then the traditional feast, which consisted of some familiar Thanksgiving staples such as turkey and pumpkin pie, and some not-so-familiar dishes such as pigeon pie. The earliest high school football rivalries took root in the late 19th century in Massachusetts, stemming from games played on Thanksgiving; professional football took root as a Thanksgiving staple during the sport's genesis in the 1890s, and the tradition of Thanksgiving football both at the high school and professional level continues to this day. The Southern United States had long resisted adopting the holiday before largely accepting it with the increased influence of football on the day.[61]\nIn New York City, people would dress up in fanciful masks and costumes and roam the streets in merry-making mobs. By the beginning of the 20th century, these mobs had morphed[citation needed] into Ragamuffin parades consisting mostly of children dressed as \"ragamuffins\" in costumes of old and mismatched adult clothes and with deliberately smudged faces, but by the late 1950s the tradition had diminished enough to only exist in its original form in a few communities around New York, with many of its traditions subsumed into the Halloween custom of trick-or-treating.[62]\nAbraham Lincoln's successors as president followed his example of annually declaring the final Thursday in November to be Thanksgiving. But in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke with this tradition.[16] November had five Thursdays that year (instead of the more-common four), Roosevelt declared the fourth Thursday as Thanksgiving rather than the fifth one. Although many popular histories state otherwise, he made clear that his plan was to establish the holiday on the next-to-last Thursday in the month instead of the last one. With the country still in the midst of The Great Depression, Roosevelt thought an earlier Thanksgiving would give merchants a longer period to sell goods before Christmas. Increasing profits and spending during this period, Roosevelt hoped, would help bring the country out of the Depression. At the time, advertising goods for Christmas before Thanksgiving was considered inappropriate. Fred Lazarus, Jr., founder of the Federated Department Stores (later Macy's), is credited with convincing Roosevelt to push Thanksgiving to a week earlier to expand the shopping season, and within two years the change passed through Congress into law.[63][64]\nRepublicans decried the change, calling it an affront to the memory of Lincoln. People began referring to November 30 as the \"Republican Thanksgiving\" and November 23 as the \"Democratic Thanksgiving\" or \"Franksgiving\".[65]\nOn October 6, 1941, both houses of the United States Congress passed a joint resolution fixing the traditional last-Thursday date for the holiday beginning in 1942. However, in December of that year the Senate passed an amendment to the resolution that split the difference by requiring that Thanksgiving be observed annually on the fourth Thursday of November, in order to prevent confusion on the occasional years in which November has five Thursdays.[66][13] The amendment also passed the House, and on December 26, 1941, President Roosevelt signed this bill, for the first time making the date of Thanksgiving a matter of federal law and fixing the day as the fourth Thursday of November.[67]\nThe centerpiece of most Thanksgiving celebrations is the Thanksgiving dinner, consisting mainly of foods native to the Americas.[68]\nTurkey, usually roasted and stuffed (but sometimes deep-fried instead), is typically the featured item on most Thanksgiving feast tables. 40 million turkeys were consumed on Thanksgiving Day alone in 2019.[69] With 85 percent of Americans partaking in the meal, an estimated 276 million Americans dine on the festive poultry, spending an expected $1.05 billion on turkeys for Thanksgiving in 2016.[70][71]\nMashed potatoes with gravy, stuffing, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, sweet corn, various fall vegetables, squash, and pumpkin pie are among the side dishes commonly associated with Thanksgiving dinner.[72] All these are actually native to the Americas or were introduced as a new food source to the Europeans when they arrived. Turkey may be an exception.[citation needed]Philbrick (2006)[73] suggests that the Pilgrims might already have been familiar with turkey in England, even though the bird is native to the Americas. The Spaniards had brought domesticated turkeys back from Central America in the early 17th century, and the birds soon became popular fare all over Europe, including England, where turkey (as an alternative to the traditional goose) became a \"fixture at English Christmases\".[73]\nThe Pilgrims did not observe Christmas,[74] as they could find no evidence in the scriptures as to when such a holiday should be celebrated and felt its December scheduling was a spurious Roman Catholic invention.[61]\nAs a result of the size of Thanksgiving dinner, Americans eat more food on Thanksgiving than on any other day of the year.[75]\nThanksgiving dinners tend to be shorter when the participants have political differences.[76]\nThe tradition of giving thanks to God is continued today in many forms, most notably the attendance of religious services, as well as the saying of a mealtime prayer before Thanksgiving dinner. Many houses of worship offer worship services and events on Thanksgiving themes the weekend before, the day of, or the weekend after Thanksgiving.[78] At home, it is a holiday tradition in many families to begin the Thanksgiving dinner by saying grace (a prayer before or after a meal).[79] The custom is portrayed in the photograph \"Family Holding Hands and Praying Before a Thanksgiving Meal\". Before praying, it is a common practice at the dining table for \"each person [to] tell one specific reason they're thankful to God that year\".[80] While grace is said, some families hold hands until the prayer concludes, often indicated with an \"Amen\".[81][82]\nJoy Fisher, a Baptist writer, states that \"this holiday takes on a spiritual emphasis and includes recognition of the source of the blessings they enjoy year round \u2014 a loving God.\"[83] In the same vein, Hesham A. Hassaballa, an American Muslim scholar and physician, has written that Thanksgiving \"is wholly consistent with Islamic principles\" and that \"few things are more Islamic than thanking God for His blessings\".[84] Similarly many Sikh Americans also celebrate the holiday by \"giving thanks to Almighty\".[85]\nHungry diners line up outside a performing arts center for a free Thanksgiving meal in Eugene, Oregon, in 2013.\nThe poor are often provided with food at Thanksgiving time. Most communities have annual food drives that collect non-perishable packaged and canned foods, and corporations sponsor charitable distributions of staple foods and Thanksgiving dinners.[87] The Salvation Army enlists volunteers to serve Thanksgiving dinners to hundreds of people in different locales.[88][89] Additionally, pegged to be five days after Thanksgiving is Giving Tuesday, a celebration of charitable giving.[citation needed]\nSince 1924, in New York City, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is held annually every Thanksgiving Day from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, and televised nationally by NBC. The parade features parade floats with specific themes, performances from Broadway musicals, large balloons of cartoon characters, TV personalities, and high school marching bands. The float that traditionally ends the Macy's Parade is the Santa Claus float, the arrival of which is an unofficial sign of the beginning of the Christmas season. It is billed as the world's largest parade.[90]\nFor many years the Santa Claus Lane Parade (now Hollywood Christmas Parade) in Los Angeles was held on the Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving. In 1978 this was switched to the Sunday following the holiday.[104]\nAmerican football is an important part of many Thanksgiving celebrations in the United States, a tradition that dates to the earliest era of the sport in the late 19th century.[105] Professional football games are often held on Thanksgiving Day; until recently, these were the only games played during the week apart from Sunday or Monday night. The National Football League has played games on Thanksgiving every year since its creation except during World War II. The Detroit Lions have hosted a game every Thanksgiving Day from 1934 to 1938 and again every year since 1945.[106] In 1966, the Dallas Cowboys, which were founded six years earlier, adopted the practice of hosting Thanksgiving games.[107] The league added a third game in primetime in 2006; unlike the traditional afternoon doubleheader, this game has no fixed host.[108]\nSome high school football games (which include some state championship games), and informal \"Turkey Bowl\" contests played by amateur groups and organizations, are frequently held on Thanksgiving weekend.[110] Games of football preceding or following the meal in the backyard or a nearby field are also common during many family gatherings. Amateur games typically follow less organized backyard-rules, two-hand touch or flag football styles.[111]\nA U.S. Army serviceman in a turkey costume leads the Kabul Satellite Turkey Chase 10K Run on Thanksgiving Day 2011.\nThough golf and auto racing are in their off-seasons on Thanksgiving, there are events in those sports that take place on Thanksgiving weekend. The Turkey Night Grand Prix is an annual automobile race that takes place at various venues in southern California on Thanksgiving night;[116] due in part to the fact that this is after the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and IndyCar Series have finished their seasons, it allows some of the top racers in the United States to participate. In golf, Thanksgiving weekend was the traditional time of the Skins Game from 1983 to 2008.[117]\nThe world championship pumpkin chunking contest was held in early November in Delaware and televised each Thanksgiving on Science Channel, but the event was mired in liability disputes following injuries at the events in the 2010s; it has been held only once since 2016,[118] a 2019 contest in Illinois that had far fewer competitors and ran a financial loss.[119]\nIn ice hockey, the National Hockey League announced, as part of its decade-long extension with NBC, that they would begin airing a game on the Friday afternoon following Thanksgiving beginning the 2011\u201312 NHL season; the game has since been branded as the \"Thanksgiving Showdown\". (The Boston Bruins have played matinees on Black Friday since at least 1990, but 2011 was the first time the game was nationally televised.)[120]\nMany American cities hold road running events, known as \"turkey trots\", on Thanksgiving morning, so much so that as of 2018[update], Thanksgiving is the most popular race day in the U.S.[123] Depending on the organizations involved, these can range from one-mile (1.6 km) fun runs to full marathons (although no races currently use the latter; the Atlanta Marathon stopped running on Thanksgiving in 2010).[124]\nIn soccer, Major League Soccer announced in 2021 that a MLS Cup Playoffs match will be held on Thanksgiving for the first time, with a Conference Semifinals match of the 2021 Playoffs between the Colorado Rapids and the Portland Timbers held on that day. While the MLS Cup playoffs were usually held from October to December, no MLS match was held on a Thanksgiving Day before 2021.[125] There will be no MLS Cup Playoff match expected to take place on Thanksgiving in 2022 to avoid conflicts with the 2022 FIFA World Cup which also begins days before Thanksgiving.[126] That MLS Cup match that would air on Fox will be determined by the year Fox has the early NFL game or late NFL game for their \"Football-Futbol Doubleheader\" format.[citation needed]\nWhile not as prolific as Christmas specials, which usually begin right after Thanksgiving, there are many special television programs transmitted on or around Thanksgiving, such as A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, in addition to the live parades and football games mentioned above. In some cases, television broadcasters begin programming Christmas films and specials to run on Thanksgiving Day, taking the day as a signal for the beginning of the Christmas season.[citation needed]\n\"Alice's Restaurant\", an 18-minute monologue by Arlo Guthrie which is partially based on an incident that happened on Thanksgiving in 1965, was first released in 1967. It has since become a tradition on numerous classic rock and classic hits radio stations to play the full, uninterrupted recording to much fanfare each Thanksgiving Day, a tradition that appears to have originated with counterculture radio host Bob Fass, who introduced the song to the public on his radio show.[127] Another song that traditionally gets played on numerous radio stations (of many different formats) is \"The Thanksgiving Song\", a 1992 song by Adam Sandler.[128]\nIn the beginning of the 21st century, Thanksgiving or the day after was the traditional start date when radio stations flipped to continuous Christmas music. Due to Christmas creep, this date has progressed to well before Thanksgiving for most stations that follow this strategy.\nSome legends date the origins of pardoning turkey to the Harry Truman administration or even to Abraham Lincoln pardoning his son's Christmas turkey;[129] both stories have been quoted in more recent presidential speeches, but neither has any evidence in the Presidential record.[130]\nIn more recent years, two turkeys have been pardoned, in case the original turkey becomes unavailable for presidential pardoning.[131][132]\nGeorge H. W. Bush made the turkey pardon a permanent annual tradition upon assuming the presidency in 1989, a tradition that was possibly inspired in part by a joke his predecessor Ronald Reagan had cracked during the 1987 presentation and has been carried on by every president each year since.[133][134] After stints at Frying Pan Farm Park in Herndon, Virginia (1989 to 2004),[135] the Disney Resorts (2005 to 2009),[134]Mount Vernon (the estate of George Washington, 2010 to 2012), and Morven Park (the estate of Westmoreland Davis, 2013 to 2015), turkeys have lived the remainder of their lives in the care of agricultural departments of major universities. The turkeys rarely lived to see the next Thanksgiving due to being bred for large size;[129] this gradually improved over the course of the 2010s as Morven Park and the universities have been more aggressive in maintaining the turkeys' health.[136]\nU.S. President George W. Bush visits Iraq to have Thanksgiving dinner with soldiers in 2003.\nOn Thanksgiving Day, families and friends usually gather for a large meal or dinner.[137] Consequently, the Thanksgiving holiday weekend is one of the busiest travel periods of the year.[138] Thanksgiving is a four-day or five-day weekend vacation for schools and colleges. Most business and government workers (78% as of 2007) are given Thanksgiving and the day after as paid holidays.[139] Thanksgiving Eve (also known as Blackout Wednesday), the night before Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest nights of the year for bars and clubs as many college students and others return to their hometowns to reunite with friends and family.[140]\nMuch like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is observed by some as a \"National Day of Mourning\", in acknowledgment of the genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists.[141][142][143] Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of \"Pilgrims and Natives looking past their differences\" to break bread.[144] Professor R.W. Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: \"One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting.\"[145] Some of the controversy regarding Thanksgiving has been used to justify the Christmas creep (the act of putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving). Those who sympathize with this view acknowledge it as a small minority view; author and humanist J.G. Rodwan, who does not celebrate Thanksgiving, noted\n\"If you put forth the interpretation ... that touches on the dishonorable treatment of the native population that lived in what became the United States, then you are likely to be dismissed as some sort of crank\".[60]\nThanksgiving Day, a function which originated in New England two or three centuries ago when those people recognized that they really had something to be thankful for \u2014 annually, not oftener \u2014 if they had succeeded in exterminating their neighbors, the Indians, during the previous twelve months, instead of getting exterminated by their neighbors, the Indians. Thanksgiving Day became a habit, for the reason that in the course of time, as the years drifted on, it was perceived that the exterminating had ceased to be mutual and was all on the white man's side, consequently on the Lord's side; hence it was proper to thank the Lord for it and extend the usual compliments.\nThe perception of Thanksgiving among Native Americans is not, however, universally negative and some do celebrate the holiday. Tim Giago (Oglala Lakota, 1934\u20132022), founder of the Native American Journalists Association, sought to reconcile Thanksgiving with Native American fall harvest celebrations. He compares Thanksgiving to \"wopila\", a thanks-giving celebration practiced by Native Americans of the Great Plains. He wrote in The Huffington Post: \"The idea of a day of Thanksgiving has been a part of the Native American landscape for centuries. The fact that it is also a national holiday for all Americans blends in perfectly with Native American traditions.\" He also shares personal anecdotes of Native American families coming together to celebrate Thanksgiving.[150]\nMembers of the Oneida Indian Nation marched in the 2010 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with a float called \"The True Spirit of Thanksgiving\" and have done so every year since.[151]\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism (4A) opposed the celebration of Thanksgiving Day, offering an alternative observance called Blamegiving Day, which was in their eyes, \"a protest against Divine negligence, to be observed each year on Thanksgiving Day, on the assumption, for the day only, that God exists\".[152] Citing their view of the separation of church and state, some atheists in recent times have particularly criticized the annual recitation of Thanksgiving proclamations by the President of the United States, because these proclamations often revolve around the theme of giving thanks to God.[153]\nThe move by retailers to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day (as opposed to the traditional day after) has been criticized as forcing (under threat of being fired) low-end retail workers, who compose an increasing share of the nation's workforce, to work odd hours and to handle atypical, unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest.[154] In response to this controversy, Macy's and Best Buy (both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving, even earlier than they had the year before) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees who would rather have the day after Thanksgiving off instead of Thanksgiving itself.[155][156] By 2021, retailers had largely abandoned efforts to hold Thanksgiving doorbusters and returned their focus to Black Friday proper.[157]Blue laws in several Northeastern states[which?] prevent retailers in those states from opening on Thanksgiving. Such retailers typically opened at midnight on the day after Thanksgiving.[156]\nJournalist Edward R. Murrow and producer David Lowe deliberately chose Thanksgiving weekend 1960 to release Murrow's final story for CBS News. Entitled Harvest of Shame, the hour-long documentary was designed \"to shock Americans into action\" regarding the treatment of impoverished migrant workers in the country, hoping to contrast Thanksgiving dinner and its excesses with the poverty of those who picked the vegetables.[158] Murrow acknowledged the documentary portrayed the United States from a hostile perspective and, when he left CBS to join the United States Information Agency in 1961, unsuccessfully tried to stop the special from being aired in the United Kingdom.[159][160]\nSince being fixed on the fourth Thursday in November by law in 1941,[67] the holiday in the United States can occur on any date from November 22 to 28. When it falls on November 22 or 23, it is not the last Thursday, but the penultimate Thursday in November. Regardless, it is the Thursday preceding the last Saturday of November.\nBecause Thanksgiving is a federal holiday, all United States government offices are closed and all employees are paid for that day. It is also a holiday for the New York Stock Exchange and most other financial markets and financial services companies.[161]\nThe date of Thanksgiving Day follows a 28-year cycle, broken only by century years that are not a multiple of 400 (e.g. 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500 ...). The break in the regular cycle is an effect of the leap year algorithm, which dictates that such years are common years as an adjustment for the calendar / season alignment that leap years provide. Past and future dates of celebration include:[162]\nA broader period of Thanksgivingtide leads into and follows the holiday of Thanksgiving itself. The day after Thanksgiving is a holiday for some companies and most schools. In the last two decades of the 20th century, it became known as Black Friday, the beginning of the Christmas shopping season and a day for chaotic, early-morning sales at major retailers that were closed on Thanksgiving.[163] A contrasting movement known as Buy Nothing Day originated in Canada in 1992.[164] The day after Thanksgiving is also Native American Heritage Day, a day to pay tribute to Native Americans for their many contributions to the United States.[165]\nSmall Business Saturday, a movement promoting shopping at smaller local establishments, takes place on the last Saturday in November, two days after Thanksgiving.[166]Cyber Monday is a nickname given to the Monday following Thanksgiving; the day evolved in the early days of the Internet, when consumers returning to work took advantage of their employers' broadband Internet connections to do online shopping and retailers began offering sales to meet the demand.[167] (Green Monday is a similar observance in Christmastide.) Giving Tuesday takes place on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.[168]\n^\nFootball games are scheduled and televised throughout the nation; an elaborately constructed, now traditional Macy's parade may be viewed. There are special services, which some attend, and turkeys and other foods are given by churches and other charitable organizations to the poor.[1]\n^\nHowever, Puritans did participate in occasional days of fasting and days of thanksgiving, sometimes declared by the Church of England but developed even further by the Puritans. ... A day of thanksgiving might be declared to celebrate and thank God for particular military victory, or good health following a wave of disease, or an especially bountiful harvest that saved people from starvation. ... The annual days of thanksgiving consisted mainly of worship services and family dinners, and this was repeated over the years.[3]\n^\n... many of the Indians coming amongst us, and amongst the rest their greatest king Massasoyt, with some ninetie men, whom for three dayes we entertained and feasted ...[6]\n^Winslow, Edward (1624). \"Good Newes from New-England\"(PDF).

        "context": "\nP. J. McGuire, Vice President of the American Federation of Labor, is frequently credited as the father of Labor Day in the United States.\nBeginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, diverse groups of trade unionists chose a variety of days on which to celebrate labor. In the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the early 1880s.\nAlternative accounts of the event's origin exist. Descendants of two men with similar last names claim their great-grandfather was the true father of the holiday.[7]\nAccording to one early history of Labor Day, the event originated in connection with a General Assembly of the Knights of Labor convened in New York City in September 1882.[8] In connection with this clandestine Knights assembly, a public parade of various labor organizations was held on September 5 under the auspices of the Central Labor Union (CLU) of New York.[8] Secretary of the CLU Matthew Maguire is credited for first proposing that a national Labor Day holiday subsequently be held on the first Monday of each September in the aftermath of this successful public demonstration.[2][7]\nAn alternative theory maintains that the idea of Labor Day was the brainchild of Peter J. McGuire, a vice president of the American Federation of Labor, who, after a visit to Toronto where he saw parades celebrating labor that May,[9][10] had put forward the initial proposal in the spring of 1882.[4] According to McGuire, on May 8, 1882, he made a proposition to the fledgling Central Labor Union in New York City that a day be set aside for a \"general holiday for the laboring classes\".[11] According to McGuire he further recommended that the event should begin with a street parade as a public demonstration of organized labor's solidarity and strength, with the march followed by a picnic, to which participating local unions could sell tickets as a fundraiser.[11] According to McGuire he suggested the first Monday in September as an ideal date for such a public celebration, owing to optimum weather and the date's place on the calendar, sitting midway between the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving public holidays.[11]\nLabor Day picnics and other public gatherings frequently featured speeches by prominent labor leaders.[12]\nIn 1909, the American Federation of Labor convention designated the Sunday preceding Labor Day as \"Labor Sunday\", to be dedicated to the spiritual and educational aspects of the labor movement.[2] This secondary date failed to gain significant traction in popular culture, although some churches continue to acknowledge it.[13]\nThe popularity of the event spread across the country. In 1887, Oregon became the first state of the United States to make Labor Day an official public holiday. By 1894, thirty U.S. states were already officially celebrating Labor Day. In that year, Congress passed a bill recognizing the first Monday of September as Labor Day and making it an official federal holiday. President Grover Cleveland signed the bill into law on June 28.[14][4] The federal law, however, only made it a holiday for federal workers. As late as the 1930s, unions were encouraging workers to strike to make sure they got the day off.[15] All U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories have subsequently made Labor Day a statutory holiday.[16] Labor Day became a federal holiday shortly after the Pullman Strike.\nThe date of May 1 (an ancient European folk holiday known as May Day) emerged in 1886 as an alternative holiday for the celebration of labor, later becoming known as International Workers' Day. The date had its origins at the 1885 convention of the American Federation of Labor, which passed a resolution calling for adoption of the eight-hour day effective May 1, 1886.[17] While negotiation was envisioned for achievement of the shortened work day, use of the strike to enforce this demand was recognized, with May 1 advocated as a date for coordinated strike action.[17] The proximity of the date to the bloody Haymarket affair of May 4, 1886, further accentuated May First's radical reputation.[13]\nThere was disagreement among labor unions at this time about when a holiday celebrating workers should be, with some advocating for continued emphasis of the September march-and-picnic date while others sought the designation of the more politically charged date of May 1. Conservative Democratic President Grover Cleveland was one of those concerned that a labor holiday on May 1 would tend to become a commemoration of the Haymarket affair and would strengthen socialist and anarchist movements that backed the May 1 commemoration around the globe.[18] In 1887, he publicly supported the September Labor Day holiday as a less inflammatory alternative,[19] formally adopting the date as a United States federal holiday through a law that he signed in 1894.[2]\nSince the mid-1950s, the United States has celebrated Loyalty Day and Law Day on May 1. Unlike Labor Day, neither are legal public holidays (in that government agencies and most businesses do not shut down to celebrate them) and therefore have remained relatively obscure. Loyalty Day is formally celebrated in a few cities, while some bar associations hold Law Day events to celebrate the rule of law.[20][21]\nLabor Day is called the \"unofficial end of summer\"[22] because it marks the end of the U.S. culture's nominal summer season. Many take their two-week vacations during the two weeks ending Labor Day weekend.[23] Many fall activities, such as school and sports (particularly football), begin about this time.\nIn the United States, many school districts resume classes around the Labor Day holiday weekend (see First day of school). Some begin the week before, making Labor Day weekend the first three-day weekend of the school calendar, while others return the Tuesday following Labor Day. Many districts across the Midwest are opting to begin school after Labor Day.[24]\nIn the U.S. state of Virginia, the amusement park industry has successfully lobbied for legislation requiring most school districts in the state to have their first day of school after Labor Day, in order to give families another weekend to visit amusement parks in the state. The relevant statute has been nicknamed the \"Kings Dominion law\" after one such park.[25] This law was repealed in 2019.[26]\nIn the U.S. state of Minnesota, the State Fair ends on Labor Day. Under state law, public schools normally do not begin until after the holiday. One reason given for this timing was to allow time for schoolchildren to show 4-H projects at the Fair.[27]\nIn fashion, Labor Day is (or was) considered the last day when it is acceptable to wear white[33] or seersucker.[34][35]\nThere are numerous events and activities organized in major cities. For example, New York offers the Labor Day Carnival, and fireworks over Coney Island.[36] In Washington, one popular event is the Labor Day Concert at the U.S. Capitol featuring the National Symphony Orchestra with free attendance.[37]\nTo take advantage of large numbers of potential customers with time to shop, Labor Day has become an important weekend for discounts and allowances by many retailers in the United States, especially for back-to-school sales. Some retailers claim it is one of the largest sale dates of the year, second only to the Christmas season's Black Friday.[38]\n^ abcThe Bridgemen's magazine.

The full listing of teams with consecutive appearances is below in order of first occurrence; winning games are in bold:\n^ abThe Seahawks and Buccaneers each began play in 1976. For scheduling purposes, the Seahawks were placed in the NFC and the Buccaneers were placed in the AFC for their first year of play. In 1977, the two teams switched conferences, placing the Seahawks in the AFC and the Buccaneers in the NFC. In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC. Neither the Seahawks nor Buccaneers have played in the Super Bowl representing the AFC.\nThe New England Patriots played their first championship game in Super Bowl XX (pictured) where they lost to the Bears.

The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos).\nFour current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002 (the year Houston joined the NFL). The other two teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl (Cleveland and Detroit) both held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season[n 7]. Teams are listed below according to the length of their current Super Bowl droughts:\n^The New York Jets and Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (Super Bowl III) is the only Super Bowl matchup that cannot be repeated under the current playoff alignment, as the Colts have since been placed in the AFC (at the time, along with all of the former AFL teams, including the Jets) as part of the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970. For the same reason, it is the only Super Bowl rematch that is capable of being played in the postseason outside of the Super Bowl.\n^ abcdThree NFL franchises, the Colts, Steelers, and Browns, were placed in the newly-formed AFC, joining the ten extant AFL franchises, when the two leagues merged in 1970. The Colts are the only team to have qualified for the Super Bowl for both the \"National\" and \"American\" sides.\n^ abcAlthough the 1995 Cleveland Browns became the 1996 Baltimore Ravens, the Browns' name, brand and history remained in Cleveland and was continued by the 1999 Cleveland Browns; the Ravens, for historical purposes, are considered a separate franchise.\n^The Jets and the Chiefs are the only non-NFL teams to win the Super Bowl, both being members of the now-defunct AFL at the time. The Jets have not appeared in the Super Bowl since joining the NFL following the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970.\n1 \u2013 Dates in the list denote the season, not necessarily the calendar year in which the championship game was played. For instance, Super Bowl LIV was played in 2020, but was the championship for the 2019 season.\n2 \u2013 From 1966 to 1969, the first four Super Bowls were \"World Championship\" games played between two independent professional football leagues, AFL and NFL, and when the league merged in 1970 the Super Bowl became the NFL Championship Game.",

        "effective_year": "2023",
        "context": "\nThe Academy Award for Best Animated Feature is given each year for the best animated film. An animated feature is defined by the academy as a film with a running time of more than 40 minutes in which characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique, a significant number of the major characters are animated, and animation figures in no less than 75 percent of the running time. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in 2002 for films released in 2001.[1][2][3]\nThe entire AMPAS membership has been eligible to choose the winner since the award's inception. If there are sixteen or more films submitted for the category, the winner is voted from a shortlist of five films, otherwise there will only be three films on the shortlist.[4]\nBy 2001, the rise of sustained competitors to Disney in the feature animated film market, such as DreamWorks Animation (founded by former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg), created an increase of film releases of significant annual number enough for AMPAS to reconsider.[11] The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first given out at the 74th Academy Awards,[12] held on March 24, 2002.[13] The academy included a rule that stated that the award would not be presented in a year in which fewer than eight eligible films opened in theaters.[14] It dropped the rule on April 23, 2019, to make voting for animated films more acceptable.[15] People in the animation industry, as well as fans, expressed hope that the prestige from this award and the resulting boost to the box office would encourage the increased production of animated features.\nIn 2009, when the nominee slots for Best Picture were doubled to ten, Up was nominated for both Animated Feature and Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards, the first to do so since the inception of the Animated Feature category. This feat was repeated the following year by Toy Story 3.\nSome members and fans have criticized the award, however, saying it is only intended to prevent animated films from having a chance of winning Best Picture. DreamWorks had advertised heavily during the holiday 2001 season for Shrek, but was disappointed when the rumored Best Picture nomination did not materialize, though it was nominated for and ultimately won the inaugural Best Animated Feature award.[1]\nThe criticism surrounding the Best Animated Feature category was particularly prominent at the 81st Academy Awards, in which WALL-E won the award but was not nominated for Best Picture, despite receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike and being generally considered to be one of the best films of 2008.[19][20][21][22] This sparked controversy over whether the film was deliberately snubbed of such nomination by the academy. Film critic Peter Travers commented that \"if there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, it's WALL-E.\" However, official Academy Award regulations state that any film nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture.[4]\nFrom 2010 onward, with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category, Pixar (a perennial nominee) did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box-office receipts, while Pixar's sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards.[23]\nAt the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, Bailey stated that animated films are \"formative experiences as kids who watch them,\" as James put it, \"So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again.\" Scott added: \"I see some parents who know exactly what we're talking about.\"[24] The remarks were heavily criticized by animation fans and those working in the animation industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are strictly for children, especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of Hollywood content and revenue during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phil Lord, co-producer of one of the nominated films, The Mitchells vs. the Machines, tweeted that it was \"super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure.\" The film's official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading: \"Animation is cinema.\"[25][26] A week later, Lord and his producing partner Christopher Miller wrote a guest column in Variety criticizing the academy for the joke and how Hollywood has been treating animation writing that \"no one set out to diminish animated films, but it's high time we set out to elevate them.\" They also suggested to the academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema.[27]\nAdding to the controversy was that the award for Best Animated Short Film (the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children) was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast.[28] The winner for the Best Animated Short award was The Windshield Wiper, a multilingual Spanish-American film which is adult animated, while another nominee in three categories: Best Animated Feature, Best Documentary Feature, and Best International Feature Film, was Flee, a PG-13 rated animated documentary about an Afghan refugee. Alberto Mielgo, director of The Windshield Wiper, later gave an acceptance speech for the Oscar: \"Animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine. Animation for adults is a fact. It's happening. Let's call it cinema. I'm very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation.\"[29] Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision to not broadcast the award.[30]\nUp and Toy Story 3 are the first two films to have won both Best Animated Feature and to have received Best Picture nominations. Their nominations after the academy expanded the potential number of nominees for Best Picture from five to ten.\nShrek is the only non-Disney/Pixar animated film to be nominated for a screenwriting category, Best Adapted Screenplay, while winning the inaugural Best Animated Feature category.[56][57]\n\u2021Dates and years listed for each ceremony were the eligibility period of film release in Los Angeles County. For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period was done on a seasonal basis, from August to July. For the 6th ceremony, held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933. From the 7th ceremony, held in 1935, through the 92nd ceremony, held in 2020, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. For the 93rd ceremony, held in 2021, the eligibility period was from January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. For the 94th ceremony, held in 2022, the eligibility period was from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021.",

The first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released on September 23, 2008. The operating system is developed by Google on a yearly cycle since at least 2011.[1] New major releases are announced at Google I/O along with its first public beta to supported Google Pixel devices. The stable version is then released later in the year.\nThe development of Android started in 2003 by Android, Inc., which was purchased by Google in 2005.[2] There were at least two internal releases of the software inside Google and the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) before the beta version was released.[3][4] The beta was released on November 5, 2007,[5][6] while the software development kit (SDK) was released on November 12, 2007.[7] Several public beta versions of the SDK were released.[8] These releases were done through software emulation as physical devices did not exist to test the operating system. Both the operating system itself and the SDK were released along with their source code, as free software under the Apache License.[9]\nThe first public release of Android 1.0 occurred with the release of the T-Mobile G1 (aka HTC Dream) in October 2008.[10] Android 1.0 and 1.1 were not released under specific code names.[11] The code names \"Astro Boy\" and \"Bender\" were tagged internally on some of the early pre-1.0 milestone builds and were never used as the actual code names of the 1.0 and 1.1 releases of the OS.[12]\nThe project manager, Ryan Gibson, conceived using a confectionery-themed naming scheme for public releases, starting with Android 1.5 Cupcake. Google announced in August 2019 they were ending the confectionery theming scheme to use numerical ordering for future versions.[13] The first release under the numerical order format was Android 10, which was released September 2019.\nIn 2017, Google announced that Google Play would begin to require apps to target a recent Android version.[14] Since then, a new major Android version has been released in the second half of each year, and apps must target it by August 31 of the following year for new apps, or November 1 for app updates.[15]\n^12L launched as part of the March 2022 security update to supported Pixel devices. The factory images for March 2022 and subsequent updates display the version as 12.1.[25] The device's about page will still show the Android version as 12.[26]\nThe following tables show the release dates and key features of all Android operating system updates to date, listed chronologically by their official application programming interface (API) levels.\nAndroid 1.0 (API 1)\nAndroid 1.0, the first commercial version of the software, was released on September 23, 2008.[29] The first commercially available Android device was the HTC Dream.[30] Android 1.0 incorporated the following features:\nOn February 9, 2009, the Android 1.1 update was released, initially for the HTC Dream only. Android 1.1 was known as \"Petit Four\" internally, though this name was not used officially.[12][37] The update resolved bugs, changed the Android API and added a number of features:[38]\nVersion\nRelease date\nFeatures\n1.1\nFebruary 9, 2009\nDetails and reviews available when a user searches for businesses on Maps.\nLonger in-call screen timeout by default when using the speakerphone, plus the ability to show/hide the dialpad.\nOn April 27, 2009, the Android 1.5 update was released, based on Linux kernel 2.6.27.[39][40] This was the first release to officially use a codename based on a dessert item (\"Cupcake\"), a theme used for all releases until Android Pie, with Android 10 and later using a number-only system. The update included several new features and UI amendments:[41]\nOpen Accessory Library support. Open Accessory was introduced in 3.1 (Honeycomb) but the Open Accessory Library grants 2.3.4 added support when connecting to a USB peripheral with compatible software and a compatible application on the device.[77]\nSwitched the default encryption for SSL from AES256-SHA to RC4-MD5.[78][79]\nOn February 22, 2011, the Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) SDK \u2013 the first tablet-only Android update \u2013 was released, based on Linux kernel 2.6.36.[85][86][87][88] The first device featuring this version, the Motorola Xoom tablet, was released on February 24, 2011.[89] The update's features included:[85]\nDisallows applications from having to write access to secondary storage (memory cards on devices with internal primary storage) outside of designated, application-specific directories. Full access to primary internal storage is still allowed through a separate application-level permission.[91][92]\nThe SDK for Android 4.0.1 (Ice Cream Sandwich), based on Linux kernel 3.0.1,[98] was publicly released on October 19, 2011.[99] Google's Gabe Cohen stated that Android 4.0 was \"theoretically compatible\" with any Android 2.3.x device in production at that time.[100] The source code for Android 4.0 became available on November 14, 2011.[101] Ice Cream Sandwich was the last version to officially support Adobe Systems' Flash player.[102] The update introduced numerous new features:[103][104][105]\nGoogle announced Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) at the Google I/O conference on June 27, 2012. Based on Linux kernel 3.0.31, Jelly Bean was an incremental update with the primary aim of improving the functionality and performance of the user interface. The performance improvement involved \"Project Butter\", which uses touch anticipation, triple buffering, extended vsync timing and a fixed frame rate of 60 fps to create a fluid and \"buttery-smooth\" UI.[114] Android 4.1 Jelly Bean was released to the Android Open Source Project on July 9, 2012,[115] and the Nexus 7 tablet, the first device to run Jelly Bean, was released on July 13, 2012.\nVersion\nRelease date\nFeatures\nImage(s)\n4.1\nJuly 9, 2012\nSmoother user interface:\nVsync timing across all drawing and animation done by the Android framework, including application rendering, touch events, screen composition and display refresh.\nGoogle was expected to announce Jelly Bean 4.2 at an event in New York City on October 29, 2012, but the event was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy.[123] Instead of rescheduling the live event, Google announced the new version with a press release, under the slogan \"A new flavor of Jelly Bean\". Jelly Bean 4.2 was based on Linux kernel 3.4.0, and debuted on Google's Nexus 4 and Nexus 10, which were released on November 13, 2012.[124][125]\nAccessibility improvements: triple-tap to magnify the entire screen, pan and zoom with two fingers. Speech output and Gesture Mode navigation for blind users.\nNew clock application with a built-in world clock, stop watch and timer.\nAll devices now use the same interface layout, previously adapted from phones on 4.1 for smaller tablets (with centered software buttons, the system bar at the top of the screen, and a home screen with a dock and centered application menu), regardless of screen size.\nIncreased number of extended notifications and Actionable Notifications for more applications, allowing users to respond to certain notifications within the notification bar and without launching the application directly.\nGoogle released Jelly Bean 4.3 under the slogan \"An even sweeter Jelly Bean\" on July 24, 2013, during an event in San Francisco called \"Breakfast with Sundar Pichai\". Most Nexus devices received the update within a week, although the second-generation Nexus 7 tablet was the first device to officially ship with it.[136] A minor bug fix update was released on August 22, 2013.[137]\nGoogle announced Android 4.4 KitKat on September 3, 2013. Although initially under the \"Key Lime Pie\" (\"KLP\") codename, the name was changed because \"very few people actually know the taste of a key lime pie.\"[149] Some technology bloggers also expected the \"Key Lime Pie\" release to be Android 5.[150] KitKat debuted on Google's Nexus 5 on October 31, 2013, and was optimized to run on a greater range of devices than earlier Android versions, having 512 MB of RAM as a recommended minimum; those improvements were known as \"Project Svelte\" internally at Google.[151] The required minimum amount of RAM available to Android is 340 MB, and all devices with less than 512 MB of RAM must report themselves as \"low RAM\" devices.[152]\nStorage Access Framework, an API allowing apps to retrieve files in a consistent manner. As part of the framework, a new system file picker allows users to access files from various sources (including those exposed by apps, such as online storage services).[91]\nAndroid 5.0 \"Lollipop\" was unveiled under the codename \"Android L\" on June 25, 2014, during Google I/O. It became available as an official over-the-air (OTA) update on November 12, 2014, for select devices that run distributions of Android serviced by Google, including Nexus and Google Play edition devices. Its source code was made available on November 3, 2014.[182][183]\nLollipop features a redesigned user interface built around a responsive design language referred to as \"material design\". Other changes include improvements to the notifications, which can be accessed from the lockscreen and displayed within applications as top-of-the-screen banners. Furthermore, Google made internal changes to the platform, with the Android Runtime (ART) officially replacing Dalvik for improved application performance, and with changes intended to improve and optimize battery usage, known internally as Project Volta.[184][185][186][187]\nGuest logins and multiple user accounts are available on more devices, such as phones.[192]\nAudio input and output through USB devices.\nThird-party applications regain the ability to read and modify data located anywhere on external storage, such as on SD cards. However, those must be adapted to the storage access framework of Android API level 21 or higher.[193][194]\nFixes a bug with TRIM support (introduced in Version 4.3), which prevented devices from running on-charger cleanups of file system allocations if the device was turned off at midnight, or if it was charged only when in use.[203]\nChanges how alarms wake the CPU, and how alarms compete for system resources.[204]\nAndroid 6.0 \"Marshmallow\" was unveiled under the codename \"Android M\" during Google I/O on May 28, 2015, for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 phones, Nexus 9 tablet, and Nexus Player set-top box, under the build number MPZ44Q.[210] The third developer preview (MPA44G) was released on August 17, 2015, for the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player devices,[211] and was updated to MPA44I that brought fixes related to Android for Work profiles.[212]\nAndroid \"Nougat\" (codenamed N in-development) is the seventh major release of the Android operating system. It was first released as a developer preview on March 9, 2016, with factory images for supported Nexus devices, as well as with the new \"Android Beta Program\" which allows supported devices to be upgraded directly to the Android Nougat beta via an over-the-air update. The final release was on August 22, 2016. The final preview build was released on July 18, 2016,[233] with the build number NPD90G.\nOn October 19, 2016, Google released Android 7.1.1 as a developer preview for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and the Pixel C. A second preview became available on November 22, 2016, before the final version was released to the public on December 5, 2016.\nAndroid Oreo is the eighth major release of the Android operating system. It was first released as a developer preview, codenamed Android O, on March 21, 2017, with factory images for supported Nexus and Pixel devices. The final developer preview was released on July 24, 2017, with the stable version released in August 2017.\nAndroid 8.1 Oreo is the sixteenth minor release of the Android operating system. It was first released as a developer preview on October 25, 2017, with factory images for current Nexus and Pixel devices. A second developer preview was made available on November 27, 2017, for Nexus and Pixel devices, before the stable version was released on December 5, 2017.\nAndroid Pie is the ninth major version of the Android operating system. It was first announced by Google on March 7, 2018, and the first developer preview was released on the same day. The second preview, considered beta quality, was released on May 8, 2018. The final beta of Android Pie (fifth preview, also considered as a \"Release Candidate\") was released on July 25, 2018. The first official release was released on August 6, 2018.\nAndroid 12L[c] is an interim release for Android 12 that includes design tweaks for larger displays and minor stability changes to the operating system. It was announced on October 2021 alongside Beta releases with a stable version launching on March 7, 2022.\nVersion\nRelease date\nFeatures\nImage(s)\n12L\nMarch 7, 2022\nImprovements specific for foldable phones, tablets, desktop-sized screens and Chromebooks, and modifications to the user interface to tailor it to larger screens.[297]\nART update with a new garbage collector (GC) utilizing the Linux userfaultfd system call.[303][304][305] It reduces memory pressure, compiled code size, jank and prevents the risk of killing apps because of low memory during GC.[305] Other changes also improve app startup, reduce jank and improve performance.[305] Because of the Mainline project, Android 12 ART will also be updated.[303]\nThe main hardware platform for Android is the 64-bitARM architecture (i.e. ARMv8-A; previously the 32-bitARMv7 architecture was supported and first ARMv5), with x86[d] and MIPS[e] architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android, but MIPS support has since been deprecated and support was removed in NDK r17.[311]\nAndroid1.0 through 1.5 required a 2 megapixel camera with autofocus camera. This was relaxed to a fixed-focus camera with Android1.6.[312]\nIn 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones[313] and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64.[314][315] Since Android5.0 Lollipop, 64-bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the 32-bit variants.\nRequirements for the minimum amount of RAM for devices running Android 7.1 depend on screen size and density and type of CPU, ranging from 816MB\u20131.8GB for 64-bit and 512MB\u20131.3GB for 32-bit meaning in practice 1GB for the most common type of display (while minimum for Android watch is 416MB).[316][f] The recommendation for Android4.4 is to have at least 512MB of RAM,[317] while for \"low RAM\" devices 340MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor.[152] Android 4.4 requires a 32-bitARMv7, MIPS or x86 architecture processor,[318] together with an OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible graphics processing unit (GPU).[319] Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.2 and since Android 7.0 Vulkan (and version 1.1 available for some devices[320]). Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.[319] In 2021, Android was ported to RISC-V.[321] In 2021, Qualcomm said it will support more updates.[322]\n^The 2.3.6 update had the side-effect of impairing the Wi-Fi hotspot functionality of many Canadian Nexus S phones. Google acknowledged this problem and fixed it in late September.[83][84]\n^For Canadian consumers, 4.0.2 reportedly created a bug on the Galaxy Nexus that crashed the application market when users attempted to view details of any Android application. It also inadvertently reduced the NFC capabilities of the Nexus phone.[109][110]\n^Mithun Chandrasekhar (February 2, 2011). \"Google's Android Event Analysis\". AnandTech. Retrieved February 5, 2011.

Embargoes against both sides' war crimes have been sought.\nMaking his fourth appearance in a Cricket World Cup (see #1 and 2), Virat has scored 1,000 runs this year (the eighth time in his career), and, on his birthday (November 5), he broke the record for the fastest 49th century (277 innings).\nSince being drafted into the National Football League in 2017, Dobbs has played for seven teams (some twice). On November 5, this perpetual second-string quarterback secured a comeback win for the Minnesota Vikings by throwing a touchdown pass, the first player at that position to do so consecutively for three different teams in one season.\nThis 2014 novel set in World War II, centered around a blind French girl and a teenage German forced to join the Nazi army, was adapted into an eponymous miniseries by Netflix, starring legally blind actress Aria Mia Loberti, as well as Mark Ruffalo as her father.\nDirected by Martin Scorsese (pictured) who adapted the 2017 book of the same name, KotFM was released in theaters in October 20 (and soon will enter Apple TV+). Based on a series of Osage Indian murders that occurred over 20 years in the early 20th century after oil was discovered on the natives' land in Oklahoma, the film has already earned US$137million and received Oscar buzz for those involved in the film.\nOnly with its season/series finale the return of Tom Hiddleston as the Asgardian God of Mischief warranted an entry here. It's easy to see why, as Secret Invasion already frustrated those following the Disney+ Marvel Cinematic Universe shows, and the previous five episodes of Loki mostly focused on complicated time mechanics that would make Doctor Who jealous. The conclusion where Loki had to prevent the Multiverse from collapsing on itself made up for it, and between this and #3 now the MCU fans can take a rest until the return of the animated anthology What If...? by the end of the December.\nNetflix released Sly, a documentary about action movie legend Sylvester Stallone (pictured), and yet the man himself got less views than his first son, who also acted - including as Rocky Balboa's son in Rocky V - and died at just 36 in 2012 of a heart disease.\nThe Hindu festival of lights is celebrated in various cultures for nearly a week in the lunisolar months from mid-September through mid-November, symbolizing the spiritual \"victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance\".\nBack to the Stallones, Sly served as a companion piece to the other 80s action legend documentary Arnold, and Stallone was even more ambitious in that he also delved into writing and directing, making him crucial in creating three memorable franchises in Rocky, Rambo and The Expendables. He even helped his brother Frank get some musical jobs.\nWhile #7 ranks fifth among India's highest-grossing of 2023 (and it's close to overtaking Jailer as fourth), the first is this production that hit Netflix on the 58th birthday of star Shah Rukh Khan, November 2.\nDirected by David Fincher and starring Michael Fassbender (pictured), this film is based on the graphic novel of the same name and follows the titular assassin who gets embroiled in an international manhunt after a hit goes wrong. The film had a limited theatrical release worldwide in October and began streaming on Netflix on November 10.\nThe Australian cricketer scored a record-breaking double century to save his team from the jaws of defeat in last Tuesday's match in #1 against Afghanistan, leading to the elimination of his opponents from the tournament, and some well deserved recognition.\nThe former British Home Secretary drew attention by criticising some pro-Palestine protests in London which were planned to take place on the annual Remembrance Day services. Her comments were accused of stirring up a counter-protest in which the far right attacked police. She was then sacked by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on November 13, and was replaced by former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, who in turn was replaced by former Prime Minister David Cameron (marking the first time a former prime minister served in a ministerial post in over 50 years).\nThe popular video game series and media franchise began in August 2014, about a night-time pizza restaurant employee who must defend themselves against animatronic characters (Freddy Fazbear cosplay pictured) who become mobile and hostile. The media franchise has maintained a fanbase over the years, finally leading to a movie to be based on it (see #12).\nPreventing a return from ChatGPT is one half of #6. As if bombings and ground invasions weren't enough, Israel earns extra criticism from the international community for cutting off resources from theGaza Strip to make life even worse for those caught in the crossfire, with the Gazan health system being particularly hindered.\nThis list excludes the Wikipedia main page, non-article pages (such as redlinks), and anomalous entries (such as DDoS attacks or likely automated views).

        "context": "\nThe Academy Award for Best Picture is one of the Academy Awards (also known as Oscars) presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) since the awards debuted in 1929. This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot.[1] The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.[2][3][4]\nThe Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception.[5] There have been 591 films nominated for Best Picture and 95 winners.[6]\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture,\" the former being won by the war epic Wings, and the latter by the art film Sunrise. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, The Jazz Singer was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a sui generis item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.[7]\nThe following year, the Academy dropped the Unique and Artistic Picture award, deciding retroactively that the award won by Wings was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award.[8] Although the award kept the title Outstanding Picture for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called Best Picture.[6]\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of Shakespeare in Love had received the award.[9][10][11]\nAs of 2020[update], the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:[12]\nThose with screen credit of \"producer\" or \"produced by\", explicitly excluding those with the screen credit \"executive producer, co-producer, associate producer, line producer, or produced in association with\"\nthose three or fewer producers who have performed the major portion of the producing functions\nThe rules allow a bona fide team of not more than two people to be considered a single \"producer\" if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.[12]\nThe Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for The Reader.[13] As of 2014[update] the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in \"rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].\"[12]\nSteven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at twelve, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. As for the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer holds the record with five wins and 40 nominations.\nOn June 24, 2009, AMPAS announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from five to ten, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009).[15] Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of The Dark Knight and WALL-E (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture.[16][17][18] Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when eight to 12 films were nominated each year. \"Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,\" AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. \"I can't wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.\"[15]\nAt the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting).[19] In 2011, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between five and ten; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process.[20] Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, \"A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn't feel an obligation to round out the number.\"[21] This system lasted until 2021, when the Academy reverted back to a set number of ten nominees from the 94th Academy Awards onward.[22]\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system. Oliver! is the only G-rated film and Midnight Cowboy is the only X-rated (now NC-17) film, so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been downgraded to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was Patton (1970) and the most recent was Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was The Last Emperor (1987) and the most recent was CODA (2021).\nOnly three animated films have been nominated for Best Picture: Beauty and the Beast (1991), Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010). The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won.\nThe Best Documentary Feature category was initiated in 1941, leaving Chang as the only documentary feature previously nominated, and that in the \"Unique and Artistic Production\" category at the 1927/28 awards.\nToy Story 3, Mad Max: Fury Road and Top Gun: Maverick are the only sequels to be nominated without any predecessors being nominated. The Godfather Part II and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King are the only sequels to have won the award, and their respective trilogies are the only series to have three films nominated. The Godfather series is the only film series with multiple Best Picture winners, with the first film winning the award for 1972 and the second film winning the award for 1974.[23]\nClint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima was a companion piece to his film Flags of Our Fathers that was released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back.\nThe Artist (2011) was the first essentially silent (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and a dream sequence with sound effects) film since Wings to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928's The Patriot. It was the first Best Picture winner to be produced entirely in black-and-white since 1960's The Apartment. (Schindler's List, the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but contains some color sequences.)[26]\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\" which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023.[38] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development.[38] As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\".[39] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities, or who are deaf or hard of hearing.[38]\nFor the 94th and 95th Academy Awards (films released in 2021 and 2022), filmmakers were required to submit a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form to be considered for Best Picture but were not required to fulfill the standards.[39] These standards will only apply to the Best Picture category and do not affect a film's eligibility in other Oscar categories.[38]\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees.[6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, however, it may be the year after first release (as with Casablanca and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, Crash). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\nUntil 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of Shakespeare in Love made speeches after its win.[9][10] A three-producer limit has been applied some years since.[10][11] There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of Crash and Little Miss Sunshine.[11] The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for The Reader.[13] However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.\nFor the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten; it was adjusted from 2011 to 2020 to vary between five and ten, but has been a full ten since 2021.\nFor the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. This has been the rule every year since except 2020, when the end date was extended to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021, which was correspondingly limited to March 1 to December 31.\n^The 2nd Academy Awards is unique in being the only occasion where there were no official nominees. Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of de facto nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges at the time.\n^The Academy also announced that A Farewell to Arms came in second, and Little Women third.\n^The Academy also announced that The Barretts of Wimpole Street came in second, and The House of Rothschild third.\n^The Academy also announced that The Informer came in second, and Captain Blood third.\n\u2021Dates and years listed for each ceremony were the eligibility period of film release in Los Angeles County. For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period was done on a seasonal basis, from August to July. For the 6th ceremony, held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933. From the 7th ceremony, held in 1935, through the 92nd ceremony, held in 2020, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. For the 93rd ceremony, held in 2021, the eligibility period was from January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. For the 94th ceremony, held in 2022, the eligibility period was from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021.",

        "effective_year": "2023",
        "context": "\nPatch Tuesday[1] (also known as Update Tuesday[1][2]) is an unofficial term used to refer to when Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle and others regularly release software patches for their software products.[3] It is widely referred to in this way by the industry.[4][5][6] Microsoft formalized Patch Tuesday in October 2003.[1][7] Patch Tuesday is known within Microsoft also as the \"B\" release, to distinguish it from the \"C\" and \"D\" releases that occur in the third and fourth weeks of the month, respectively.[1]\nPatch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month[8] in North America. Critical security updates are occasionally released outside of the normal Patch Tuesday cycle; these are known as \"Out-of-band\" releases. As far as the integrated Windows Update (WU) function is concerned, Patch Tuesday begins at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.[9] Vulnerability information is immediately available in the Security Update Guide. The updates show up in Download Center before they are added to WU, and the KB articles are unlocked later.\nLess experienced users often remained unaware of Windows Update and did not install it. Microsoft countered this issue in Windows ME with the Automatic Updates component, which displayed availability of updates, with the option of automatic installation.\nCustomers with multiple copies of Windows, such as corporate users, not only had to update every Windows deployment in the company but also to uninstall patches issued by Microsoft that broke existing functionality.\nMicrosoft introduced \"Patch Tuesday\" in October 2003 to reduce the cost of distributing patches after the Blaster worm.[10] This system accumulates security patches over a month, and dispatches them all on the second Tuesday of each month, an event for which system administrators may prepare. The following day, informally known as \"Exploit Wednesday\",[11] marks the time when exploits may appear in the wild which take advantage on unpatched machines of the newly announced vulnerabilities.\nTuesday was chosen as the optimal day of the week to distribute software patches. This is done to maximize the amount of time available before the upcoming weekend to correct any issues that might arise with those patches, while leaving Monday free to address other unexpected issues that might have arisen over the preceding weekend[citation needed].\nAn obvious security implication is that security problems that have a solution are withheld from the public for up to a month. This policy is adequate when the vulnerability is not widely known or is extremely obscure, but that is not always the case.\nThere have been cases where vulnerability information became public or actual worms were circulating prior to the next scheduled Patch Tuesday. In critical cases Microsoft issues corresponding patches as they become ready, alleviating the risk if updates are checked for and installed frequently.\nAt the Ignite 2015 event, Microsoft revealed a change in distributing security patches. They release security updates to home PCs, tablets and phones as soon as they are ready, while enterprise customers will stay on the monthly update cycle, which was reworked as Windows Update for Business.[12]\nMany exploitation events are seen shortly after the release of a patch;[13]analysis of the patch helps exploit developers to immediately take advantage of the previously undisclosed vulnerability, which will remain in unpatched systems.[14] Therefore, the term \"Exploit Wednesday\" was coined.[15]\nMicrosoft warned users that it discontinued support for Windows XP starting on April 8, 2014 \u2013 users running Windows XP afterwards would be at the risk of attacks. As security patches of newer Windows versions can reveal similar (or same) vulnerabilities already present in older Windows versions, this can allow attacks on devices with unsupported Windows versions (cf. \"zero-day attacks\"). However Microsoft stopped fixing such (and other) vulnerabilities in unsupported Windows versions, regardless how widely known they became, leaving devices running these Windows versions vulnerable to attacks. Microsoft made a singular exception during the rapid spread of the WannaCry ransomware and released patches in May 2017 for the by then-unsupported Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 (in addition to then supported Windows versions).[16]\nFor Windows Vista \"extended support\" was ended April 11, 2017, which will leave vulnerabilities discovered afterwards unfixed, creating the same situation for Vista as for XP before.[17]\nFor Windows 7 (including Service Pack 1), support ended January 14, 2020,[17] and on January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1;[17] this will cause the same \"unfixed vulnerabilities\" issue for users of these operating systems. Support for Windows 8 already ended January 12, 2016 (with users having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to continue to get support), and support for Windows 7 without SP1 was ended April 9, 2013 (with the ability to install SP1 to continue to get support until 2020, or having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to receive support after 2020).[17]\nStarting with Windows 10, Microsoft began releasing feature updates of Windows twice per year. These releases brought new functionalities, and are governed by Microsoft's modern lifecycle policy, which specifies a support period of 18-36 months. This is in contrast to previous Windows versions, which received only infrequent updates via service packs, and whose support was governed by the fixed lifecycle policy. With the release of Windows 11, both Windows 10 and 11 started receiving annual feature updates in the second half of the year.\nOnce a release's support period ends, devices must be updated to the latest feature update in order to receive updates from Microsoft. As such, for Home and Pro editions of Windows 10 and 11, the latest Windows version is downloaded and installed automatically when the device approaches the end of support date.\n^Four updates were released: \"Moment 1\" with build 22621.675 on October 18, 2022 \"Moment 2\" with build 22621.1344 on February 28, 2023 \"Moment 3\" with build 22621.1778 on May 24, 2023 \"Moment 4\" with build 22621.2361 on September 26, 2023\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color have reached their expiration dates and are no longer supported by Microsoft.\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color are no longer the latest version of Windows 11, but are still supported by Microsoft.\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color are the latest (by SKU) public version of Windows 11.\nIn addition to the commonly used editions like Home and Pro, Microsoft offers specialized Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) versions of Windows 10 with longer support timelines, governed by Microsoft's fixed lifecycle policy. For instance, Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB will receive extended support until October 13, 2026,[18] and Windows 10 LTSC 2019 will receive extended support until January 9, 2029.[19]\nSAP's \"Security Patch Day\", when the company advises users to install security updates, was chosen to coincide with Patch Tuesdays.[20]Adobe Systems' update schedule for Flash Player since November 2012 also coincides with Patch Tuesday.[21] One of the reasons for this is that Flash Player comes as part of Windows starting with Windows 8 and Flash Player updates for the built-in and the plugin based version both need to be published at the same time in order to prevent reverse-engineering threats. Oracle's quarterly updates coincide with Patch Tuesday.[22]\nWindows Update uses the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download the updates, using idle network bandwidth.[23] However BITS will use the speed as reported by the network interface (NIC) to calculate bandwidth. This can lead to bandwidth calculation errors, for example when a fast network adapter (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (e.g. 56 kbit/s) \u2013 according to Microsoft \"BITS will compete for the full bandwidth [of the NIC] ... BITS has no visibility of the network traffic beyond the client.\"[24]\nFurthermore, the Windows Update servers of Microsoft do not honor the TCP's slow start congestion control strategy.[25] As a result, other users on the same network may experience significantly slower connections from machines actively retrieving updates. This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth-constrained link such as those found in many multi-PC homes and small to medium-sized businesses. Bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers can be reduced significantly by deploying Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to distribute the updates locally.\nIn addition to updates being downloaded from Microsoft servers, Windows 10 devices can \"share\" updates in a peer-to-peer fashion with other Windows 10 devices on the local network, or even with Windows 10 devices on the internet. This can potentially distribute updates faster while reducing usage for networks with a metered connection.[26][27]",

        "question": "The upcoming Microsoft's Patch Tuesday will come out on what date in North America?",
        "context_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday#:~:text=Patch%20Tuesday%20occurs%20on%20the%20second%20Tuesday%20of%20each%20month%5B8%5D%20in%20North%20America.",

        "context": "\nPatch Tuesday[1] (also known as Update Tuesday[1][2]) is an unofficial term used to refer to when Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle and others regularly release software patches for their software products.[3] It is widely referred to in this way by the industry.[4][5][6] Microsoft formalized Patch Tuesday in October 2003.[1][7] Patch Tuesday is known within Microsoft also as the \"B\" release, to distinguish it from the \"C\" and \"D\" releases that occur in the third and fourth weeks of the month, respectively.[1]\nPatch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month[8] in North America. Critical security updates are occasionally released outside of the normal Patch Tuesday cycle; these are known as \"Out-of-band\" releases. As far as the integrated Windows Update (WU) function is concerned, Patch Tuesday begins at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.[9] Vulnerability information is immediately available in the Security Update Guide. The updates show up in Download Center before they are added to WU, and the KB articles are unlocked later.\nLess experienced users often remained unaware of Windows Update and did not install it. Microsoft countered this issue in Windows ME with the Automatic Updates component, which displayed availability of updates, with the option of automatic installation.\nCustomers with multiple copies of Windows, such as corporate users, not only had to update every Windows deployment in the company but also to uninstall patches issued by Microsoft that broke existing functionality.\nMicrosoft introduced \"Patch Tuesday\" in October 2003 to reduce the cost of distributing patches after the Blaster worm.[10] This system accumulates security patches over a month, and dispatches them all on the second Tuesday of each month, an event for which system administrators may prepare. The following day, informally known as \"Exploit Wednesday\",[11] marks the time when exploits may appear in the wild which take advantage on unpatched machines of the newly announced vulnerabilities.\nTuesday was chosen as the optimal day of the week to distribute software patches. This is done to maximize the amount of time available before the upcoming weekend to correct any issues that might arise with those patches, while leaving Monday free to address other unexpected issues that might have arisen over the preceding weekend[citation needed].\nAn obvious security implication is that security problems that have a solution are withheld from the public for up to a month. This policy is adequate when the vulnerability is not widely known or is extremely obscure, but that is not always the case.\nThere have been cases where vulnerability information became public or actual worms were circulating prior to the next scheduled Patch Tuesday. In critical cases Microsoft issues corresponding patches as they become ready, alleviating the risk if updates are checked for and installed frequently.\nAt the Ignite 2015 event, Microsoft revealed a change in distributing security patches. They release security updates to home PCs, tablets and phones as soon as they are ready, while enterprise customers will stay on the monthly update cycle, which was reworked as Windows Update for Business.[12]\nMany exploitation events are seen shortly after the release of a patch;[13]analysis of the patch helps exploit developers to immediately take advantage of the previously undisclosed vulnerability, which will remain in unpatched systems.[14] Therefore, the term \"Exploit Wednesday\" was coined.[15]\nMicrosoft warned users that it discontinued support for Windows XP starting on April 8, 2014 \u2013 users running Windows XP afterwards would be at the risk of attacks. As security patches of newer Windows versions can reveal similar (or same) vulnerabilities already present in older Windows versions, this can allow attacks on devices with unsupported Windows versions (cf. \"zero-day attacks\"). However Microsoft stopped fixing such (and other) vulnerabilities in unsupported Windows versions, regardless how widely known they became, leaving devices running these Windows versions vulnerable to attacks. Microsoft made a singular exception during the rapid spread of the WannaCry ransomware and released patches in May 2017 for the by then-unsupported Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 (in addition to then supported Windows versions).[16]\nFor Windows Vista \"extended support\" was ended April 11, 2017, which will leave vulnerabilities discovered afterwards unfixed, creating the same situation for Vista as for XP before.[17]\nFor Windows 7 (including Service Pack 1), support ended January 14, 2020,[17] and on January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1;[17] this will cause the same \"unfixed vulnerabilities\" issue for users of these operating systems. Support for Windows 8 already ended January 12, 2016 (with users having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to continue to get support), and support for Windows 7 without SP1 was ended April 9, 2013 (with the ability to install SP1 to continue to get support until 2020, or having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to receive support after 2020).[17]\nStarting with Windows 10, Microsoft began releasing feature updates of Windows twice per year. These releases brought new functionalities, and are governed by Microsoft's modern lifecycle policy, which specifies a support period of 18-36 months. This is in contrast to previous Windows versions, which received only infrequent updates via service packs, and whose support was governed by the fixed lifecycle policy. With the release of Windows 11, both Windows 10 and 11 started receiving annual feature updates in the second half of the year.\nOnce a release's support period ends, devices must be updated to the latest feature update in order to receive updates from Microsoft. As such, for Home and Pro editions of Windows 10 and 11, the latest Windows version is downloaded and installed automatically when the device approaches the end of support date.\n^Four updates were released: \"Moment 1\" with build 22621.675 on October 18, 2022 \"Moment 2\" with build 22621.1344 on February 28, 2023 \"Moment 3\" with build 22621.1778 on May 24, 2023 \"Moment 4\" with build 22621.2361 on September 26, 2023\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color have reached their expiration dates and are no longer supported by Microsoft.\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color are no longer the latest version of Windows 11, but are still supported by Microsoft.\n^Windows 11 builds that have this color are the latest (by SKU) public version of Windows 11.\nIn addition to the commonly used editions like Home and Pro, Microsoft offers specialized Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) versions of Windows 10 with longer support timelines, governed by Microsoft's fixed lifecycle policy. For instance, Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB will receive extended support until October 13, 2026,[18] and Windows 10 LTSC 2019 will receive extended support until January 9, 2029.[19]\nSAP's \"Security Patch Day\", when the company advises users to install security updates, was chosen to coincide with Patch Tuesdays.[20]Adobe Systems' update schedule for Flash Player since November 2012 also coincides with Patch Tuesday.[21] One of the reasons for this is that Flash Player comes as part of Windows starting with Windows 8 and Flash Player updates for the built-in and the plugin based version both need to be published at the same time in order to prevent reverse-engineering threats. Oracle's quarterly updates coincide with Patch Tuesday.[22]\nWindows Update uses the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download the updates, using idle network bandwidth.[23] However BITS will use the speed as reported by the network interface (NIC) to calculate bandwidth. This can lead to bandwidth calculation errors, for example when a fast network adapter (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (e.g. 56 kbit/s) \u2013 according to Microsoft \"BITS will compete for the full bandwidth [of the NIC] ... BITS has no visibility of the network traffic beyond the client.\"[24]\nFurthermore, the Windows Update servers of Microsoft do not honor the TCP's slow start congestion control strategy.[25] As a result, other users on the same network may experience significantly slower connections from machines actively retrieving updates. This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth-constrained link such as those found in many multi-PC homes and small to medium-sized businesses. Bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers can be reduced significantly by deploying Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to distribute the updates locally.\nIn addition to updates being downloaded from Microsoft servers, Windows 10 devices can \"share\" updates in a peer-to-peer fashion with other Windows 10 devices on the local network, or even with Windows 10 devices on the internet. This can potentially distribute updates faster while reducing usage for networks with a metered connection.[26][27]",

        "context": "\nThe Super Bowl is the annual league championship game of the National Football League (NFL). It has served as the final game of every NFL season since 1966, replacing the NFL Championship Game. Since 2022, the game is played on the second Sunday in February. Prior Super Bowls were played on Sundays in early to mid-January from 1967 to 1978, late January from 1979 to 2003,[a] and the first Sunday of February from 2004 to 2021. Winning teams are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the eponymous coach who won the first two Super Bowls. Due to the NFL restricting use of its \"Super Bowl\" trademark, it is frequently referred to as the \"big game\" or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. The day the game is played is often referred to as \"Super Bowl Sunday\" or simply \"Super Sunday\".\nThe game was created as part of a 1966 merger agreement between the NFL and the competing American Football League (AFL) to have their best teams compete for a championship. It was originally called the AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game until the \"Super Bowl\" moniker was adopted in 1969's Super Bowl III. The first four Super Bowls from 1967 to 1970 were played before the merger, with the NFL and AFL each winning two. After the merger in 1970, the 10 AFL teams and three NFL teams formed the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the National Football Conference (NFC). All games since 1971's Super Bowl V have been played between the two best teams from each conference. Since the inception of the Super Bowl, the NFC leads the AFC in wins 29\u201328.\nThe Super Bowl is among the world's most-watched single sporting events and frequently commands the largest audience among all American broadcasts during the year. It is second only to the UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual club sporting event worldwide,[2] and the seven most-watched broadcasts in American television history are Super Bowls.[3]Commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year because of the high viewership, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for the broadcast and commercial viewership becoming an integral part of the event. The Super Bowl is also the second-largest event for American food consumption, behind Thanksgiving dinner.[4]\nFor four decades after its 1920 inception, the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. In 1960, the NFL encountered its most serious competitor when the American Football League (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. The original \"bowl game\" was the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, which was first played in 1902 as the \"Tournament East\u2013West football game\" as part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and moved to the new Rose Bowl Stadium in 1923. The stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. The Tournament of Roses football game eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar Bowl), and El Paso (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton Bowl) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term \"bowl\" for any major American football game was well established.\nThe Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game, Super BowlI.\nAfter the American Football League's inaugural season, AFL commissioner Joe Foss sent an invitation to the NFL on January 14, 1961, to schedule a \"World Playoff\" game between the two leagues' champions, beginning with the upcoming 1961 season.[5] The first World Playoff game would have, if actually played, matched up the Houston Oilers vs. the Green Bay Packers. It took a half-dozen more seasons for this idea to become a reality.\nIn the mid-1960s, Lamar Hunt, owner of the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs, first used the term \"Super Bowl\"[6] to refer to the AFL\u2013NFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a Super Ball toy;[7] a vintage example of the ball is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, \"I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.\"\nThe leagues' owners chose the name \"AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game\",[8] but in July 1966 the Kansas City Star quoted Hunt in discussing \"the Super Bowl\u2014that's my term for the championship game between the two leagues\",[9] and the media immediately began using the term.[10] Although the league stated in 1967 that \"not many people like it\", asking for suggestions and considering alternatives such as \"Merger Bowl\" and \"The Game\", the Associated Press reported that \"Super Bowl\" \"grew and grew and grew\u2014until it reached the point that there was Super Week, Super Sunday, Super Teams, Super Players, ad infinitum\".[8] \"Super Bowl\" became official beginning with the third annual game.[11]\nThe winning team receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the coach of the Green Bay Packers, who won the first two Super Bowl games as well as five NFL championships preceding the merger in 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966 and 1967. Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named after him. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in Super Bowl V in Miami.\nThe Super Bowl is played on the second Sunday in February.[13] The current NFL schedule begins on the weekend immediately after Labor Day (the first Monday in September). That weekend is the first of an 18-week regular season, followed by three weeks of playoff games and one week for the Pro Bowl. The Super Bowl is contested the week after the Pro Bowl. This schedule has been in effect since an 18th week (and 17th regular season game) were added to the NFL schedule for the 2021 season, with Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, the first to be played under this format.\nThe Super Bowl was held in January from its inception until 2002, when the week of games following the September 11 attacks were postponed and rescheduled, extending the season by a week and causing Super Bowl XXXVI to be played on February 3. Beginning with Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, the Super Bowl was scheduled for the first Sunday in February until the schedule expansion of the 2021 season moved the game to the second Sunday.\nThe Patriots own the record for most Super Bowl appearances (eleven). The Cowboys, Steelers, and Denver Broncos are tied for second with eight appearances apiece, reaching that milestone in this respective order. Bill Belichickowns the record for the most Super Bowl wins (eight) and appearances (twelve: nine times as head coach, once as assistant head coach, and twice as defensive coordinator) by an individual. Tom Brady has the most Super Bowl starts (ten) and wins as a player (seven), while Charles Haley has the second-most wins among players (five).\nEight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The Minnesota Vikings were the first team to appear four times without a win, while the Buffalo Bills played in a record four consecutive Super Bowls, losing in each. The Patriots and Broncos are tied for the most Super Bowl losses (five).\nThe Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Jacksonville Jaguars are the four teams to have never appeared in a Super Bowl, although the Browns and Lions both won NFL Championships before the Super Bowl era. The Jaguars, who began play in 1995, and the Texans, who began play in 2002, are among the youngest franchises in the league.\nThe Packers won the first two AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Games, later renamed Super Bowls, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders following the 1966 and 1967 seasons, respectively. The Packers were led by quarterback Bart Starr, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for both games. These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the second threepeat in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967). The Packers are the only team to threepeat, as they also accomplished the feat in the pre-playoff era (1929, 1930 and 1931). The first playoff game in the NFL was in 1932.\nIn Super Bowl III, the AFL's New York Jets defeated the 19 1\u20442 points favorite Baltimore Colts of the NFL, 16\u20137. The Jets were led by quarterback Joe Namath, who had famously guaranteed a Jets win before the game, and former Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank, and their victory proved that the AFL was the NFL's competitive equal. This was reinforced the following year when the Chiefs defeated the NFL's Vikings 23\u20137 in Super Bowl IV.\nAfter the AFL\u2013NFL merger was completed in 1970, three franchises\u2014the Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, and Steelers\u2014would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls, between them in the decade. With the Steelers winning four of the eight.\nThe Baltimore Colts, now a member of the AFC, would start the decade by defeating the Cowboys in Super Bowl V, a game which is notable as being the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing team won the Super Bowl MVP (Cowboys' linebacker Chuck Howley). Beginning with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's championship game.\nThe Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years.\nThe Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won Super Bowl VI over the Dolphins. However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss for over a year, as the next year, the Dolphins would go 14\u20130 in the regular season and eventually win all their playoff games, capped off with a 14\u20137 victory in Super Bowl VII, becoming the first and only team to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason. The Dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning Super Bowl VIII a year later.\nThe Steelers' 1970s dynasty was interrupted only by the Raiders' first Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XI and the Cowboys' second Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XII. Conversely, the Vikings, with their Purple People Eaters defense, were the only other team to appear in multiple Super Bowls (IV, VIII, IX and XI) during the decade but failed to win each one.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s. The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXXI.\nThe 49ers against the Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX\nThe most successful team of the 1980s was the 49ers, which featured the West Coast offense of Hall of Fame head coach Bill Walsh. This offense was led by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, running back Roger Craig, and Hall of Fame defensive safety/cornerback Ronnie Lott. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the decade (XVI, XIX, XXIII, and XXIV) and made nine playoff appearances between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL. The 1984 San Francisco 49ers were the first team to achieve an 18\u20131 record, doing so under Walsh. The 1989 San Francisco 49ers, under first-year head coach George Seifert, posted the most lop-sided victory in Super Bowl history, defeating the Denver Broncos by a score of 55\u201310 in Super Bowl XXIV.\nConversely, the Cincinnati Bengals (XVI and XXIII), Dolphins, (XVII and XIX), and Broncos (XXI, XXII and XXIV) made multiple Super Bowls in the 1980s without winning one.\nFollowing several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the Cowboys rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997. From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year. In this same period, the Buffalo Bills had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, only to lose all four (XXV-XXVIII). After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX) led by quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, and wide receiver Michael Irvin. All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who were the first team to win their league-leading fifth title overall with Super Bowl XXIX with a dominant performance featuring the Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young (who threw a Super Bowl record 6 touchdown passes), Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders; however, the Cowboys' victory in Super Bowl XXX the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with Sanders after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the 49ers. The NFC's winning streak was continued by the Packers led by Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre, won Super Bowl XXXI, their first championship since Super Bowl II in 1967.\nThe Patriots made their maiden Super Bowl appearances in XX (1985) and XXXI (1996) but lost both times. However, the turn of the century would soon bring hope and glory to the franchise.\nSuper Bowl XXXII saw quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis lead the Denver Broncos to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's thirteen-year winning streak. The following year, the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game. The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls. In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams\u2014the Steelers, Patriots, Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, and Indianapolis Colts\u2014accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010.\nThe Patriots playing against the Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX\nThe New England Patriots became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade. They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s Dallas Cowboys). In Super Bowl XXXVI, first-year starting quarterback Tom Brady led his team to a 20\u201317 upset victory over the St. Louis Rams, who two seasons earlier won Super Bowl XXXIV. Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots also won Super Bowls XXXVIII[15] and XXXIX defeating the Carolina Panthers and the Philadelphia Eagles respectively. This four-year stretch of Patriot dominance was interrupted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 48\u201321 Super Bowl XXXVII victory over the Oakland Raiders.\nThe Steelers and Colts continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls XL and XLI in 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, respectively defeating the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears.\nIn the 2007 season, the Patriots became the fourth team in NFL history to have a perfect unbeaten and untied regular-season record, the second in the Super Bowl era after the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16\u20130. They easily marched through the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in Super Bowl XLII. However, they lost that game to Eli Manning and the New York Giants 17\u201314, leaving the Patriots' 2007 record at 18\u20131.\nThe following season, the Steelers logged their record sixth Super Bowl title (XLIII) in a 27\u201323, final-minute victory against the Arizona Cardinals.\nThe 2009 season saw the New Orleans Saints defeat the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV by a score of 31\u201317 to take home their first Championship. With this victory, the Saints joined the New York Jets as the only teams to have won in their sole Super Bowl appearance, a distinction the Ravens also enjoyed in winning Super Bowl XXXV after the 2000 season and the Buccaneers in 2002.\nIn the AFC, this era was dominated by the Patriots, with the only four other teams to represent the conference being the Steelers, Ravens, Broncos, and Chiefs. The Patriots had tied a record with the 1970s Dallas Cowboys for most Super Bowl appearances in a decade with five appearances (2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018). The Patriots also had four Super Bowl appearances in five years. With eight consecutive AFC championship appearances spanning 2011\u20132018, the Patriots were three wins away (2012, 2013, 2015) from eight Super Bowl appearances in the 2010s decade.\nThe Super Bowls of the 2000s and 2010s are notable for the performances (and the pedigrees) of several of the participating quarterbacks, especially on the AFC side in repeated appearances by the same teams and players. In particular, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, or Peyton Manning appeared as the AFC team's quarterback in all but two of the Super Bowls from 2001 through 2018. Conversely, the only NFC teams to make the Super Bowl multiple times with the same quarterback in this era were the Seahawks, led by quarterback Russell Wilson, and the Giants, led by quarterback Eli Manning.\nOne of these teams was featured in the culmination of the 2010 season, Super Bowl XLV, which brought the Packers their fourth Super Bowl victory and record thirteenth NFL championship overall with the defeat of the Steelers in February 2011. This became Aaron Rodgers' only Super Bowl victory so far.\nThe following year, in Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots made their first appearance of the decade, a position where they would become a mainstay. The Patriots, however, lost to the Eli Manning-led Giants, 21\u201317, who had beaten the Patriots four years before. This was the Giants' 4th Super Bowl victory.\nIn Super Bowl XLVII, the NFC's 49ers were defeated by the Ravens 34\u201331. The game had been dubbed as the 'Harbaugh Bowl' in the weeks leading up to the game, due to the fact that the coaches of the two teams, John Harbaugh and Jim Harbaugh, are brothers. During the 3rd quarter, the Ravens had a commanding 28\u20136 lead. However, there was a blackout in New Orleans, where the game was being played. The game was delayed for 34 minutes, and after play resumed, San Francisco stormed back with 17 straight points, but still lost.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII, played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in February 2014, was the first Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold-weather environment. The Seahawks won their first NFL title with a 43\u20138 defeat of the Broncos, in a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.\nIn Super Bowl XLIX, the Patriots beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Seahawks, by a score of 28\u201324. Down by 10, the Patriots mounted a late 4th quarter comeback to win the game with Tom Brady scoring two touchdowns in the 4th quarter. In a key play in the final seconds of the game, then-rookie free agent Malcolm Butler would intercept a pass by Russell Wilson at the one-yard line, allowing the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game. Tom Brady was awarded his 3rd Super Bowl MVP, tying Joe Montana for the most Super Bowl MVP awards.\nIn Super Bowl 50, the first Super Bowl to be branded with Arabic numerals, the Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, defeated the Panthers, who had the league's top-ranked offense, in what became the final game of quarterback Peyton Manning's career. Von Miller dominated, totaling 2.5 sacks and forcing two Cam Newton fumbles; both fumbles leading to Broncos touchdowns.\nIn Super Bowl LI, the first Super Bowl to end in overtime, the Atlanta Falcons led 28\u20133 late in the third quarter; however, they squandered the lead as the Patriots would tie the game 28\u201328 on back to back touchdowns and two-point conversions. The Falcons lost to the Patriots 34\u201328 in overtime. This 25-point deficit would be the largest comeback win for any team in a Super Bowl, breaking the previous of 10-point deficit to come back and win. The Patriots never held the lead until the game-winning touchdown in overtime. Tom Brady was awarded his record fourth Super Bowl MVP and 5th win as a Super Bowl Champion, throwing a then-record 466 yards for 43 completions.\nIn Super Bowl LII, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the defending champion, Patriots, 41\u201333, ending a 57-year championship drought for the franchise. Nick Foles won the Super Bowl MVP. The Patriots totaled 613 yards in defeat, with Tom Brady breaking his previous Super Bowl record of 466 passing yards with an all-time playoff record of 505 passing yards in the high-scoring game; while the Eagles would gain 538 yards in the victory. The combined total of 1,151 yards of offense for both teams broke an NFL record (for any game) that had stood for nearly seven decades. The Patriots' 33 points were the highest losing score in Super Bowl history, a record held until 2023, when the Eagles lost Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 38/35. It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance and their first win in franchise history. With the Eagles' victory, the NFC East became the first division to have each team win at least one Super Bowl.\nWhile Super Bowl LII produced the second highest-scoring Super Bowl, the following year's Super Bowl LIII became the lowest-scoring Super Bowl. The Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams, 13\u20133. In so doing, they became the team with the lowest point total by a winning team in Super Bowl history. Tom Brady would receive a record sixth Super Bowl championship, the most of any player in NFL history, surpassing his tie with Charles Haley for five wins. Brady would also become the oldest player to ever win a Super Bowl at age 41, while Bill Belichick would be the oldest coach to ever win a Super Bowl at age 66. Wide receiver Julian Edelman was named Super Bowl MVP.\nIn Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in a comeback, 31\u201320, for their first Super Bowl title in 50 years. This victory marked the first time since 1991 that the NFC did not have more Super Bowl victories than the AFC. Notable was the absence of the Patriots, who after making it to the Super Bowl the last three years and winning two of them, had lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs, being bested by the Tennessee Titans 20\u201313. That game represented Tom Brady's final game as a New England Patriot.\nIn Super Bowl LV, which took place in Tampa, Florida, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated defending champion, Chiefs, 31\u20139.[16] No player on the Buccaneers who scored points (Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, Leonard Fournette and Ryan Succop) was on the Buccaneers' roster the previous season. This marked a record seventh Super Bowl victory for Tom Brady, also more than any individual NFL franchise, and who would also break his own record for the oldest quarterback to win a championship at 43 years old. Tampa Bay head coach Bruce Arians would also break Bill Belichick's record for the oldest head coach to win a championship at 68. Super Bowl LV also marked the first time in the history of the modern league that a host city's professional football franchise got to play in a Super Bowl that was hosted in their home stadium. The following year saw the Los Angeles Rams defeat the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming the second team to win the Super Bowl in its home stadium.[17]\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.[19] The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the UEFA Champions League final.[19] For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most-watched United States originating television program of the year.[20] The game tends to have a high Nielsen television rating, which is usually around a 40 rating and 60 shares. This means that, on average, more than 100 million people from the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment.\nIn press releases preceding the game, the NFL has claimed that the upcoming Super Bowl will have a potential worldwide audience of around one billion people in over 200 countries.[21] However, this figure refers to the number of people able to watch the game, not the number of people who will actually be watching. Regardless, the statements have been frequently misinterpreted in the media as referring to the latter figure, leading to a misperception about the game's actual global audience.[22][23] The New York-based media research firm Initiative measured the global audience for the Super Bowl XXXIX at 93 million people, with 98 percent of that figure being viewers in North America, which meant roughly two million people outside North America watched the Super Bowl that year.[22]\nSuper Bowl XLIX holds the record for average number of US viewers, with 114.4 million, making the game the most-viewed television broadcast of any kind in American history.[20][24] The halftime show set a record with 118.5 million viewers tuning in.[25] Super Bowl XLIX peaked at 120.8 million viewers.[25] The game set a record for total viewers for the fifth time in six years.[citation needed]\nThe highest-rated game according to Nielsen was Super Bowl XVI in 1982, which was watched in 49.1% of households (73 shares), or 40,020,000 households at the time. Ratings for that game, a San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, may have been aided by a large blizzard that had affected much of the northeastern United States on game day, leaving residents to stay at home more than usual.[citation needed] Super Bowl XVI still ranks fourth on Nielsen's list of top-rated programs of all time, with three other Super Bowls (XVII, XX, and XLIX) in the top ten.\nFamous Super Bowl commercials include the 1984 introduction of Apple's Macintosh computer, the Budweiser \"Bud Bowl\" campaign, and the dot-com ads aired during Super Bowl XXXIV. As the television ratings of the Super Bowl have steadily increased over the years, commercial prices have also increased, with advertisers paying as much as $7 million for a thirty-second spot during Super Bowl LVI in 2022.[26] A segment of the audience tunes into the Super Bowl solely to view commercials.[27] In 2010, Nielsen reported that 51 percent of Super Bowl viewers tune in for the commercials.[28]\nSince 1991, the Super Bowl has begun between 6:19 and 6:40 PM EST so that most of the game is played during the primetime hours on the East Coast.[29]\nThroughout most of its history, the Super Bowl has been rotated annually between the same American television networks that broadcast the NFL's regular season and postseason games.\nSuper Bowl I, played in 1967, is the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the United States by two different broadcasters simultaneously. At the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game, and each network used its own announcers, but NBC was only allowed to use the CBS feed instead of producing its own.[30][31]\nBeginning with Super Bowl II, NBC televised the game in even years and CBS in odd years. This annual rotation between the two networks continued through the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger when NBC was given the rights to televise AFC games and CBS winning the rights to broadcast NFC games. Although ABC began broadcasting Monday Night Football in 1970, it was not added to the Super Bowl rotation until Super Bowl XIX, played in 1985. ABC, CBS and NBC then continued to rotate the Super Bowl until 1994, when Fox replaced CBS as the NFC broadcaster. CBS then took NBC's place in the rotation after the former replaced the later as the AFC broadcaster in 1998. As a result of new contracts signed in 2006, with NBC taking over Sunday Night Football from ESPN, and Monday Night Football moving from ABC to ESPN, NBC took ABC's place in the Super Bowl rotation. The rotation between CBS, Fox, and NBC will continue until the new contracts that will take effect for the first time with Super Bowl LVIII, allowing ABC to return and starting a four-network rotation.[32]\nThe four-year rotation beginning with Super Bowl LVIII also allows each broadcaster to offer simulcasts or alternative broadcasts on its sister networks and platforms.[32] CBS's sister network Nickelodeon is planning to air an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII.[33] And ABC's rights include ESPN simulcasts and alternative broadcasts on other ESPN networks.[32]\nThe first six Super Bowls were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place. Super Bowl VII (1973) was telecast in Los Angeles on an experimental basis after all tickets were sold ten days before the game.[37]\nGame analyst John Madden is the only person to broadcast a Super Bowl for each of the four networks that have televised the game (five with CBS, three with Fox, two with ABC, and one with NBC).\nNote: Years listed are the year the game was actually played (will be played[\u02c7]) rather than what NFL season it is considered to have been. ^*: The current TV contract with the networks expires after the 2022 season (or Super Bowl LVII in early 2023). Under the deal, the Super Bowl is currently rotated annually between CBS, Fox, and NBC in that order. ABC will return to the rotation in the upcoming contract, which is scheduled to take effect at the start of the 2023 season.[32] ^**: The first Super Bowl was simultaneously broadcast by CBS and NBC, with each network using the same video feed (from CBS), but providing its own commentary.\nThe Super Bowl provides an extremely strong lead-in to programming following it on the same channel, the effects of which can last for several hours. For instance, in discussing the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo television critic Alan Pergament noted that following Super Bowl XLVII, which aired on CBS: \"A paid program that ran on CBS4 (WIVB-TV) at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 rating. That's higher than some CW prime time shows get on WNLO-TV, Channel 4's sister station.\"[38]\nBecause of this strong coattail effect, the network that airs the Super Bowl typically takes advantage of the large audience to air an episode of a hit series or to premiere the pilot of a promising new one in the lead-out slot, which immediately follows the Super Bowl and post-game coverage.\nInitially, it was sort of a novelty and so it didn't quite feel right. But it was just like, this is the year... Bands of our generation, you can sort of be seen on a stage like this or, like, not seen. There's not a lot of middle places. It is a tremendous venue.\n\u2014 Bruce Springsteen on why he turned down several invitations to perform at the Super Bowl before finally agreeing to appear in Super Bowl XLIII[39]\nJennifer Hudson sings the national anthem at Super Bowl XLIIIClosing the opening ceremony of the Super Bowl 50\nThe U.S. national anthem has been performed at all but one Super Bowl: Super Bowl XI in 1977 when Vikki Carr sang \"America the Beautiful\" in place of the anthem. Beginning with Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, \"America the Beautiful\" is sung before the national anthem every year and is followed by the presentation of the colors and a military flyover preceded the anthem. Beginning with Super Bowl LV in 2021, \"Lift Every Voice And Sing\" the national anthem in honor of Black History Month, is sung prior to \"America the Beautiful\".\nUnlike regular season or playoff games, thirty minutes are allocated for the Super Bowl halftime. After a special live episode of the Fox sketch comedy series In Living Color caused a drop in viewership for the Super Bowl XXVI halftime show, the NFL sought to increase the Super Bowl's audience by hiring A-list talent to perform. They approached Michael Jackson, whose performance the following year drew higher figures than the game itself.[44][45] Another notable performance came during Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002, when U2 performed; during their third song, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", the band played under a large projection screen which scrolled through names of the victims of the September 11 attacks.\nThe halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII attracted controversy, following an incident in which Justin Timberlake removed a piece of Janet Jackson's top, briefly exposing one of her breasts before the broadcast quickly cut away from the shot. The incident led to fines being issued by the FCC (and a larger crackdown over \"indecent\" content broadcast on television), and MTV (then a sister to the game's broadcaster that year, CBS, under Viacom) being banned by the NFL from producing the Super Bowl halftime show in the future. In an effort to prevent a repeat of the incident, the NFL held a moratorium on Super Bowl halftime shows featuring pop performers, and instead invited a single, headlining veteran act, such as Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. This practice ended at Super Bowl XLV, which returned to using current pop acts such as The Black Eyed Peas, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga.[46][47]\nAnnouncer Alan Roach has handled public address announcing duties for the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL in 2006, with the exceptions of Super Bowl XLVIII and 50 when the Denver Broncos played in those games. Roach was also Denver's regular P.A. announcer during those years, and thus the league felt it was a potential competitive advantage.[48]\nSeven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after Super Bowl XXVII's host stadium was selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home stadium in the same city; for example, five of Los Angeles's Bowls were played at the Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl. Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.\nTraditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[52] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area\u2014Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis\u2014Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in the New York area\u2014Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium. Only MetLife Stadium did not have a roof (be it fixed or retractable) but it was still picked as the host stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in an apparent waiver of the warm-climate rule, with a contingency plan to reschedule the game in the event of heavy snowfall.[53] MetLife Stadium's selection over Sun Life Stadium generated controversy as the league requested a roof to be added to Sun Life Stadium (in the event of rainstorms) in order to be considered for future Super Bowls.[54]\nThere have been a few instances where the league has rescinded the Super Bowl from cities. Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 was originally awarded to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, but after Arizona voters elected not to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a paid state employees' holiday in 1990, the NFL moved the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[55] When voters in Arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992, Super Bowl XXX in 1996 was awarded to Tempe. Super Bowl XXXIII was awarded first to Candlestick Park in San Francisco, but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through, the game was moved to Pro Player Stadium in greater Miami. Super Bowl XXXVII was awarded to a new stadium not yet built in San Francisco, when that stadium failed to be built, the game was moved to Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[56] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\nThe location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[57]\nThrough Super Bowl LVI, teams were allowed to bid for the rights to host Super Bowls, where cities submitted proposals to host a Super Bowl and were evaluated in terms of stadium renovation and their ability to host, but this competition was rescinded in 2018.[needs update][52][58] The league has made all decisions regarding hosting sites from Super Bowl LVII onward; the league chose a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team put together a hosting proposal, and the league voted upon it to determine if it is acceptable.[59]\nIn 2014, a document listing the specific requirements of Super Bowl hosts was leaked, giving a clear list of what was required for a Super Bowl host.[60] Some of the host requirements include:\nThe host stadium must be in a market that hosts an NFL team and must have a minimum of 70,000 seats, with the media and electrical amenities necessary to produce the Super Bowl. Stadiums may include temporary seating for Super Bowls, but seating must be approved by the league. Stadiums where the average game day temperature is below 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) must either have a roof or a waiver given by the league. There must be a minimum of 35,000 parking spaces within one mile of the stadium.\nThe host stadium must have space for the Gameday Experience, a large pregame entertainment area, within walking distance of the stadium.\nThe host city must have space for the NFL Experience, the interactive football theme park which is operated the week before the Super Bowl. An indoor venue for the event must have a minimum of 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2), and an outdoor venue must have a minimum of 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2). Additionally, there must be space nearby for the Media Center, and space for all other events involved in the Super Bowl week, including golf courses and bowling alleys.\nThe necessary infrastructure must be in place around the stadium and other Super Bowl facilities, including parking, security, electrical needs, media needs, communication needs, and transportation needs.\nThere must be a minimum number of hotel spaces within one hour's drive of the stadium equaling 35% of the stadium's capacity, along with hotels for the teams, officials, media, and other dignitaries. (For Super Bowl XXXIX, the city of Jacksonville docked several luxury cruise liners at their port to act as temporary hotel space.[61])\nThere must be practice space of equal and comparable quality for both teams within a twenty-minute drive of the team hotels, and rehearsal space for all events within a reasonable distance to the stadium. The practice facilities must have one grass field and at least one field of the same surface as the host stadium.\nThe stadium must have a minimum of 70,000 fixed seats, including club and fixed suite seating, during regular season operations.\nMuch of the cost of a Super Bowl is to be assumed by the host community, although some costs are enumerated within the requirements to be assumed by the NFL. New Orleans, the site of Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game.[62]\nThe NFL allocates backup stadiums for the Super Bowl every year, in the event of a last-minute relocation of the game.[63]\nThe designated \"home team\" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.[64][65] This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Packers were the designated home team. Regardless of being the home or away team of record, each team has their team logo and wordmark painted in one of the end zones. Designated away teams have won 32 of 57 Super Bowls to date (approximately 56%).\nSince Super Bowl XIII in 1979, the home team is given the choice of wearing their colored or white jerseys. Originally, the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted in the Cowboys donning their less exposed[discuss] dark blue jerseys for Super Bowl V. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been seven exceptions: the Cowboys during Super Bowls XIII and XXVII, the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII, the Steelers during Super Bowl XL, the Broncos during Super Bowl 50, the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and the Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. The Cowboys, since 1964, have worn white jerseys at home. The Washington Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992, continued by Richie Petitbon and Norv Turner through 2000, then again when Gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007. Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970, opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The Steelers' decision was compared with the Patriots in Super Bowl XX; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season, but after winning road playoff games against the Jets and Dolphins wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to scarlet for the Super Bowl as the designated home team. For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, Denver general manager John Elway simply stated, \"We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms\"; they previously had been 0\u20134 in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys.[66][67] The Broncos' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition, losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion. It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII. During the pairing of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games, but have worn white for a home game in the 2008, 2010, and 2011 seasons.[68] The Patriots were 3\u20130 in their white uniforms in Super Bowls before Super Bowl LII with Belichick and Brady,[69][70] and they may have been going on recent trends of teams who wear white for the Super Bowl game.[71][72][73] For Super Bowl LV, when the Buccaneers became the first team to reach the Super Bowl that their own stadium hosted, the Bucs coincidentally were designated the home team as per AFC-NFC rotation and elected to wear their white jerseys, having previously won both their divisional and championship post-season games on the road in white jerseys.[74] White-shirted teams have won 37 of 57 Super Bowls to date (65%). The only teams to win in their dark-colored uniform in more recent years are the Packers against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, the Eagles against the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and the Chiefs against the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV.[75] Since Super Bowl XXXIX, teams in white jerseys have won 16 of the last 19 Super Bowls.\nThe 49ers, as part of the league's 75th Anniversary celebration, used their 1955 throwback uniform in Super Bowl XXIX, which for that year was their regular home jersey. The Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII wore their royal blue and yellow uniforms, which was a throwback uniform but then turned into their primary colors over the navy blue and metallic gold uniform, which they have previously worn for six home games including a home playoff game.[76] No team has yet worn a third jersey or Color Rush uniform for the Super Bowl. The 49ers reportedly requested to wear an all-white third jersey ensemble for Super Bowl LIV, which the San Francisco Chronicle noted they could do with special permission from the league; the league never granted such permission, and the 49ers instead opted for their standard uniform of white jerseys with gold pants.[77]\n^^: Stadium has since been demolished. ^\u2021: Prior to the incorporation of Miami Gardens in 2003, the stadium was in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. ^\u2020\u2020: The original Stanford Stadium, which hosted Super Bowl XIX, was demolished and a new stadium constructed on the site in 2006. ^\u02c7: Future Super Bowls, also denoted by italics.\nTime zone complications are a significant obstacle to a Super Bowl in London; a typical 6:30 p.m. EST start would result in the game beginning at 11:30 p.m. local time in London: this in an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports, while the NFL has never in its history started a game later than 9:15 p.m. local time.[84]\nAlthough bids have been submitted for all Super Bowls through Super Bowl LIX, the soonest that any stadium outside the NFL's footprint could serve as host would be Super Bowl LXI in 2027.[85]\nThe NFL very actively seeks to prevent what it calls unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms \"NFL\", \"Super Bowl\", and \"Super Bowl Sunday\".[86] As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with euphemisms such as \"The Big Game\", or other generic descriptions.[87][88] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying \"it would be super... to have a bowl... of Planters nuts while watching the big game!\" and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the \"Superb Owl\". In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for \"Superb Owl\".[89] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase \"Super Bowl\" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that \"promote a message\", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55 inches.[90] Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that \"any use is prohibited\", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States.[90] Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 \"to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games\", and \"for other purposes\".[91]\nIn 2004, the NFL started issuing cease-and-desist letters to casinos in Las Vegas that were hosting Super Bowl parties. \"Super Bowl\" is a registered trademark, owned by the NFL, and any other business using that name for profit-making ventures is in violation of federal law, according to the letters. In reaction to the letters, many Las Vegas resorts, rather than discontinue the popular and lucrative parties, started referring to them as \"Big Game Parties\".[92][93][94]\n1 \u2013 Dates in the list denote the season, not necessarily the calendar year in which the championship game was played. For instance, Super Bowl LIV was played in 2020, but was the championship for the 2019 season.\n2 \u2013 From 1966 to 1969, the first four Super Bowls were \"World Championship\" games played between two independent professional football leagues, AFL and NFL, and when the league merged in 1970 the Super Bowl became the NFL Championship Game.",

        "context": "\nWoodrow Wilson giving his first State of the Union address; the first time since 1801 that such an address was made in person before a joint session of Congress,[1] this initiated the modern trend with regards to the State of the Union address.[2]\nThe State of the Union Address (sometimes abbreviated to SOTU) is an annual message delivered by the president of the United States to a joint session of the United States Congress near the beginning of most calendar years on the current condition of the nation.[3][4] The State of the Union Address generally includes reports on the nation's budget, economy, news, agenda, progress, achievements and the president's priorities and legislative proposals.[5]\nThe address fulfills the requirement in Article II, Section 3, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution for the president to periodically \"give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\"[3] During most of the country's first century, the president primarily submitted only a written report to Congress. After 1913, Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. president, began the regular practice of delivering the address to Congress in person as a way to rally support for the president's agenda, while also submitting a more detailed report.[3] With the advent of radio and television, the address is now broadcast live in all United States time zones on many networks.[6]\nThe speech is generally held in January or February, and an invitation to the president is extended to use the chamber of the House by the speaker of the House. Starting in 1981, Ronald Reagan, the 40th U.S. president, began the practice of newly inaugurated presidents delivering an address to Congress in the first year of their term but not designating that speech an official \"State of the Union\".[7]\nThough the language of the clause is not specific, since the 1930s, the president has made this report annually in late January or early February. Between 1934 and 2022 the date has been as early as January 3,[7] and as late as March 1.[9]\nWhile not required to deliver a speech, every president since Woodrow Wilson, with the notable exception of Herbert Hoover,[2] has made at least one State of the Union report as a speech delivered before a joint session of Congress. Before then, most presidents delivered the State of the Union as a written report.[7]\nWhat began as a communication between president and Congress has become in effect a communication between the president and the people of the United States. Since the advent of radio, and then television, the speech has been broadcast live in all United States time zones on most networks, preempting scheduled programming. Since at least the 1960s, in order to reach the largest audience, the speech has typically been given at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time, UTC-5).[10]\nGeorge Washington delivered the first regular annual message before a joint session of Congress on January 8, 1790, in New York City, then the provisional U.S. capital. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson discontinued the practice of delivering the address in person, regarding it as too monarchical (similar to the Speech from the Throne). Instead, the address was written and then sent to Congress to be read by a clerk until 1913 when Woodrow Wilson re-established the practice despite some initial controversy, and an in-person address to Congress has been delivered nearly every year since. However, there have been exceptions to this rule, with some messages being given solely in writing, and others given both in writing and orally (either in a speech to Congress or through broadcast media).[11] The last president to give a written message without a spoken address was Jimmy Carter in 1981, days before his term ended after his defeat by Ronald Reagan.[11]\nFor many years, the speech was referred to as \"the President's Annual Message to Congress\".[12] The actual term \"State of the Union\" first emerged in 1934 when Franklin D. Roosevelt used the phrase, becoming its generally accepted name since 1947.[12]\nPrior to 1934, the annual message was delivered at the end of the calendar year, in December. The ratification of the 20th Amendment on January 23, 1933, changed the opening of Congress from early March to early January, affecting the delivery of the annual message. Since 1934, the message or address has been delivered to Congress in January or February.[13]\nThe Twentieth Amendment also established January 20 as the beginning of the presidential term. In years when a new president is inaugurated, the outgoing president may deliver a final State of the Union message, but none has done so since Jimmy Carter sent a written message in 1981. In 1953 and 1961, Congress received both a written State of the Union message from the outgoing president and a separate State of the Union speech by the incoming president. Since 1981, in recognition that the responsibility of reporting the State of the Union formally belongs to the president who held office during the past year, newly inaugurated presidents have not officially called their first speech before Congress a \"State of the Union\" message.[12]\nThe text of the first page of Ronald Reagan's first State of the Union Address, given January 26, 1982\nWarren Harding's 1922 speech was the first to be broadcast on radio, albeit to a limited audience,[14] while Calvin Coolidge's 1923 speech was the first to be broadcast across the nation.[4] President Roosevelt's address in 1936 was the first delivered in the evening,[15] but this precedent was not followed again until the 1960s. Harry S. Truman's 1947 address was the first to be broadcast on television. In 1968, television networks in the United States for the first time imposed no time limit for their coverage of a State of the Union address. Delivered by Lyndon B. Johnson, this address was followed by extensive televised commentary by, among others, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Milton Friedman.[16]Bill Clinton's 1997 address was the first broadcast available live on the World Wide Web.[17]\nIn 1999, Bill Clinton became the first president to deliver an in-person State of the Union address while standing trial for impeachment; the speech occurred the same day that Clinton's defense team made its opening statement in Clinton's impeachment trial, though he did not mention the proceeding.[20]\nBecause the address is made to a joint session of Congress, the House and Senate must each pass a resolution setting a date and time for the joint session. Then, a formal invitation is made by the speaker of the House to the president typically several weeks before the appointed date.[24][25]\nEvery member of Congress can bring one guest to the State of the Union address. The president may invite up to 24 guests to be seated in a box with the First Lady. The speaker of the House may invite up to 24 guests in the speaker's box. Seating for Congress on the main floor is by a first-in, first-served basis with no reservations. The Cabinet, Supreme Court justices, members of the Diplomatic Corps, and military leaders (the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Commandant of the Coast Guard) have reserved seating.[26]\nBy approximately 8:30 p.m. on the night of the address, the members of the House have gathered in their seats for the joint session.[27] Then, the Deputy Sergeant at Arms addresses the speaker and loudly announces the vice president and members of the Senate, who enter and take the seats assigned for them.[27]\nThe speaker, and then the vice president, specify the members of the House and Senate, respectively, who will escort the president into the House chamber.[27] The Deputy Sergeant at Arms addresses the speaker again and loudly announces, in order, the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, the Chief Justice of the United States and the Associate Justices, and the Cabinet, each of whom enters and takes their seats when called.[27] The justices take the seats nearest to the speaker's rostrum and adjacent to the sections reserved for the Cabinet and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[28]\nJust after 9:00 pm, as the president reaches the door to the chamber,[29] the House Sergeant at Arms stands just inside the doors, faces the speaker, and waits until the president is ready to enter the chamber.[28] When the president is ready, the Sergeant at Arms announces the entrance, loudly stating the phrase: \"Mister [or Madam] Speaker, the president of the United States!\"[29]\nAs applause and cheering begin, the president slowly walks toward the speaker's rostrum, followed by members of the congressional escort committee.[29] The president's approach is slowed by pausing to shake hands, hug, kiss, and autograph copies of the speech for Members of Congress.[28] After taking a place at the House Clerk's desk,[29] the president hands two manila envelopes, previously placed on the desk and containing copies of the speech, to the speaker and vice president.[citation needed]\nAfter continuing applause from the attendees has diminished, the speaker introduces the president to the representatives and senators, typically stating: \"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"[28][29] This leads to a further round of applause and, eventually, the beginning of the address by the president.[29]\nCustomarily, one cabinet member (the designated survivor) does not attend the speech, in order to provide continuity in the line of succession if a catastrophe disables the president, the vice president, and other succeeding officers gathered in the House chamber. Additionally, since the September 11 attacks in 2001, a few members of Congress have been asked to relocate to undisclosed locations for the duration of the speech to form a rump Congress in the event of a disaster.[30] Since 2003, each chamber of Congress has formally named a separate designated survivor.[31][32]\nBoth the speaker and the vice president sit at the speaker's desk, behind the President for the duration of the speech. If either is unavailable, the next highest-ranking member of the respective house substitutes. Once the chamber settles down from the President's arrival, the speaker officially presents the President to the joint session of Congress. The president then delivers the speech from the podium at the front of the House Chamber.[33]\nFor the 2011 address, Senator Mark Udall of Colorado proposed a break in the tradition of seating Republicans and Democrats on opposite sides of the House;[34] this was in response to the 2011 Tucson Shooting in which Representative Gabby Giffords was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt.[35] Approximately 60 legislators signed on to Udall's proposal;[36] a similar plan for the 2012 address garnered bipartisan seating commitments from more than 160 lawmakers.[35] Efforts to intersperse the parties during the State of the Union have since waned, and by the 2016 address, seating had largely returned to the traditional partisan arrangement.[37]\nThe contents of the speeches typically contain information and status updates of the country and federal government during the incumbent president's administration.[38] It has become customary to use the phrase \"The State of the Union is strong,\" sometimes with slight variations, since President Ronald Reagan introduced it in his 1983 address.[39] It has been repeated by every president in nearly every year since, with the exception of George H. W. Bush.[39]Gerald Ford's 1975 address had been the first to use the phrasing \"The State of the Union is...\", though Ford completed the sentence with \"not good.\"[39]\nSince Reagan's 1982 address, it has also become common for presidents of both parties to honor special guests sitting in the gallery, such as American citizens or visiting heads of state.[40] During that 1982 address, Reagan acknowledged Lenny Skutnik for his act of heroism following the crash of Air Florida Flight 90.[41] Since then, the term \"Lenny Skutniks\" has been used to refer to individuals invited to sit in the gallery, and then cited by the president, during the State of the Union.[42][43]\nState of the Union speeches usually last a little over an hour, partly because of the large amounts of applause that occur from the audience throughout. The applause is often political in tone, with many portions of the speech being applauded only by members of the president's own party. As non-political officeholders, members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality. In recent years, the presiding officers of the House and the Senate, the speaker and the vice president, respectively, have departed from the neutrality expected of presiding officers of deliberative bodies, as they, too, stand and applaud in response to the remarks of the president with which they agree.[citation needed]\nSince 1966,[44] the speech has been followed on television by a response or rebuttal by a member of the major political party opposing the president's party. The response is typically broadcast from a studio with no audience. In 1970, the Democratic Party put together a TV program with their speech to reply to President Nixon, as well as a televised response to Nixon's written speech in 1973.[45] The same was done by Democrats for President Reagan's speeches in 1982 and 1985. The response is not always produced in a studio; in 1997, the Republicans for the first time delivered the response in front of high school students.[46] In 2010, Virginia GovernorBob McDonnell gave the Republican response from the House of Delegates chamber of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, in front of about 250 attendees.[47]\nAlthough much of the pomp and ceremony behind the State of the Union address is governed by tradition rather than law, in modern times, the event is seen as one of the most important in the US political calendar. It is one of the few instances when all three branches of the US government are assembled under one roof: members of both houses of Congress constituting the legislature, the president's Cabinet constituting the executive, and the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court constituting the judiciary. In addition, the military is represented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while foreign governments are represented by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. The address has also been used as an opportunity to honor the achievements of some ordinary Americans, who are typically invited by the president to sit with the First Lady.[43]\nDuring his State of the Union Address on January 11, 1944, FDR proposed the Second Bill of Rights. Roosevelt's argument was that the \"political rights\" guaranteed by the constitution and the Bill of Rights had \"proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness\".[58] This was technically a \"Message\" and not a speech, as Roosevelt had \"a case of the grippe\" and could not come; there was no joint session, and the Clerk of the Senate read the message. (Although he did manage to read it as a Fireside Chat over the radio, from his office that same day.)[59]\nDuring his State of the Union address on January 15, 1975, Gerald R. Ford very bluntly stated that \"the state of the Union is not good: Millions of Americans are out of work...We depend on others for essential energy. Some people question their Government's ability to make hard decisions and stick with them; they expect Washington politics as usual.\" Ford said he did not \"expect much if any, applause. The American people want action, and it will take both the Congress and the president to give them what they want. Progress and solutions can be achieved, and they will be achieved.\"[62]\nGeorge W. Bush delivering the 2002 State of the Union\nDuring his State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, President Bush identified North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as representing significant threats to the United States. He said, \"States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world\". In this speech, he would outline the objectives for the War on Terror.[63]\n^Sincere, Richard E. Jr. (February 1997). \"O.J., J.C., and Bill: Reflections on the State of the Union\". Metro Herald.

After the nominees are selected, the winner is chosen by a combined vote between the jury (90 percent) and public voting (10 percent).\nThe Game Awards has a voting jury consisting of over 100 video game media and influencer outlets, which have been specifically selected for their work in critically evaluating video games. Each outlet completes an unranked ballot listing its top five choices; games with the most appearances across the ballots are selected as the nominees. The winners are determined between the jury (90 percent) and public voting (10 percent).[1] The public vote is held via the official website and social media platforms; in 2022, The Game Awards partnered with Discord for social media voting,[2] though previous ceremonies have used platforms like Facebook and Twitter.[3][a] Any game released before a certain date in November prior to the ceremony is eligible for award consideration.[4] As a result, any game released after the cutoff date is eligible in the following year's ceremony,[1] such as 2018's Super Smash Bros.

        "context": "\nFollowing Arsenal's defeat to Nottingham Forest on 20 May, Manchester City officially secured a third consecutive Premier League title with three games to spare, becoming the second club after local rivals Manchester United to achieve the feat in the Premier League era. It was their ninth English title overall and their seventh since 1992.[1] The league title was the first leg in a treble-winning season for City, as they would later go on to win the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League, a feat which United had also achieved. Meanwhile, Arsenal broke the record of spending the greatest number of days, with 248, on top of the league in a top flight season without winning the title in English top flight history.[2]\nThis season was also the first since 2017\u201318, and only the fourth Premier League season overall, where all three promoted teams at the start of the season avoided relegation.[3] This was also the first time since 2014\u201315 that the team 20th at Christmas (Wolverhampton Wanderers), managed to avoid relegation.[4]\nThe 2022\u201323 season was the highest-scoring 38-game season in Premier League history, with 1,084 goals (with a 2.85 goals per match ratio, the best in the history of Premier League).[5]Erling Haaland broke the Premier League record for most goals scored by a player in one season with 36 goals.[6]\nIt was also the second Premier League season in a row where over 15 millions fans attended matches and with total of 15,289,340 spectators a new competition record was set.[7]\nThe season began with Arsenal going on a five-game unbeaten streak before they played Manchester United at Old Trafford where they lost 3\u20131.[8]Manchester City got off to a strong start, having signed striker Erling Haaland; they went on a nine-game unbeaten run before losing at Liverpool in October. Arsenal were top of the table for much of the season, with a five point lead over Manchester City in March. However, a run of three consecutive draws allowed City to cut their lead, and a 4\u20131 victory at the Etihad Stadium allowed them to take control. Arsenal's 1\u20130 defeat away at Nottingham Forest confirmed the league title for Manchester City on 20 May 2023.[9] Manchester City were presented with the Premier League trophy on 21 May 2023.[10]\nDespite losing their first two games of the season, Manchester United returned to the Champions League in Erik ten Hag's debut season as the club's manager, in addition to winning the Carabao Cup. Newcastle United qualified for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years, their highest finish since Sir Bobby Robson was the club's manager.[11] Despite a 7\u20130 victory over Manchester United, as well as a 9\u20130 victory over Bournemouth, Liverpool endured a difficult season and finished 5th, missing Champions League qualification for the first time since 2015\u201316.\nDespite spending over \u00a3600m on new transfers under new ownership led by Todd Boehly, Chelsea had one of their worst Premier League seasons to date, with the Blues finishing in the bottom half of the table after first sacking Thomas Tuchel in September, and then sacking his successor Graham Potter the following April, after only seven months in charge. Frank Lampard returned to the club as interim manager, having previously been sacked himself in January 2021, but the team fared no better under his stewardship either. They ended up finishing 12th, their lowest league finish since 1993\u201394, and had accumulated just 44 points \u2013 their lowest ever in a Premier League season.[12]\nAston Villa secured qualification for European football for the first time since 2009\u201310; an indifferent start to the season saw the departure of manager Steven Gerrard, but his successor Unai Emery, along with in-form striker Ollie Watkins, saw Villa climb the table in the second half of the season to finish 7th and qualify for the Europa Conference League.[14]Tottenham Hotspur had an erratic season, with manager Antonio Conte departing by mutual consent in March, days after publicly criticising the team in a post-match press conference.[15] He was initially replaced by his assistant Cristian Stellini until the end of the season, but a poor run, culminating in a 6\u20131 defeat away to Newcastle, where the team were 5\u20130 down after just 20 minutes, saw him sacked and replaced by Ryan Mason as caretaker manager. Tottenham ended up finishing 8th, failing to qualify for European football for the first time since 2008\u201309, and finishing below rivals Arsenal in the league for the first time since 2015\u201316.\nBrentford enjoyed one of the best seasons in their history, at one point going on a 12-match unbeaten run. During the season, they beat Manchester United, Manchester City (twice), and Liverpool. Their 9th place finish marked their highest-ever finish in top-flight football.\nBournemouth, who were tipped for relegation at the start of the season (particularly after they lost 9\u20130 to Liverpool at Anfield at the end of August, which saw manager Scott Parker sacked soon after),[16] confounded the critics by avoiding relegation, with Gary O'Neil, first as interim, then permanent manager, guiding the team to safety. Nottingham Forest broke the record for most signings in a Premier League season with 21,[17] and a late run of home victories over Brighton, Southampton and Arsenal secured safety. The final newly promoted side, Fulham, enjoyed a successful return to the top flight with a 10th place finish.\nSouthampton were the first team relegated on 13 May, finishing 20th after eleven consecutive years in the top flight. Going into the final day of the season, two relegation places were still to be confirmed, with Everton, Leeds United & Leicester City all potentially at threat of relegation. Leeds failed to repeat their last day escape of the previous season and were also relegated after three years back in the top flight, having lost 4\u20131 at home to Tottenham Hotspur. Everton escaped relegation by winning 1\u20130 against Bournemouth, extending their top flight stay to seventy consecutive years for next season.[18][19] The result meant that despite a 2\u20131 victory at home over West Ham United, Leicester would be relegated, after a nine year stay in the division, and only seven years after being crowned champions, becoming only the second team after Blackburn Rovers to be relegated as a previous Premier League title winning team.[20]\nThere was a mid-season break for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, with the last matches before the hiatus played on the weekend of 12\u201313 November 2022 and the first matches after the World Cup played on 26 December 2022, after the World Cup final on 18 December 2022.[22]\nOn 9 September 2022, all Premier League matches scheduled for 10\u201312 September were postponed as a mark of respect due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II.[23] The following week, three Premier League matches scheduled for 17\u201318 September were postponed due to the policing issues surrounding Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on 19 September.[24][25][26] Also, in the same week, the Arsenal game against Manchester City, scheduled for 19 October, was postponed to accommodate Arsenal's Europa League tie with PSV Eindhoven, which was itself postponed from 15 September to 20 October.[27][28][29]\nTwenty teams competed in the league \u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Fulham, Bournemouth, and Nottingham Forest, who returned after an absence of one, two and twenty-three years from the top flight respectively. The twenty-three years between Nottingham Forest's previous Premier League season and this season is the longest absence for a previous Premier League club in the Premier League era to date. They replaced Burnley (relegated to the Championship after a six-year top flight spell), Watford, and Norwich City (both teams relegated after just one year back in the top flight).[citation needed]\n^Since the winners of the 2022\u201323 FA Cup, Manchester City, qualified for the Champions League as a result of their league positions, the second Europa League group stage berth allocated to England was transferred to the sixth-placed team.\n^Since the winners of the 2022\u201323 EFL Cup, Manchester United, qualified for the Champions League, the Europa Conference League berth awarded to the EFL Cup winners was transferred to the highest-placed Premier League team not already qualified for European competition, the seventh-placed team.",

Classes that have been discontinued include Formula 750, 500cc, 350cc, 250cc, 125cc, 80cc, 50cc and Sidecar. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship.[1]\nThere were five classes when the championship started in 1949; 500cc, 350cc, 250cc, 125cc and sidecar (600cc). The 50cc class was introduced in 1962. Due to escalating costs that resulted in a number of manufacturers leaving the championship, the FIM limited the 50cc bikes to a single cylinder, the 125cc and 250cc bikes were limited to two cylinders and the 350cc and 500cc bikes were limited to four cylinders. The 350cc class was discontinued in 1982, two years later the 50cc class was replaced with an 80cc class, which was discontinued in 1989. The sidecar class left the series to form its own championship after 1996. In 2002, 990cc bikes replaced the 500c bikes and the class was renamed as MotoGP.[2] 660cc bikes replaced the 250cc bikes in 2010, with the class rebranded as Moto2.[3] Starting 2012, the Moto3 class (250cc one cylinder) replaced the 125cc class.\nThe 750 FIM Prize became a world championship from 1977 onwards after a favourable vote from the FIM general council.[4]\nSidecars had 600 cc engines in the first two years, after which they were replaced by 500cc engines. In 1979 the FIM created a prototype sidecar class named B2B, as opposed to the traditional B2A. Prototypes were banned in 1980, but from 1981 onwards prototypes were allowed again, this time without having a separate class.\nMotoE was introduced in 2019 as a \"World Cup\" until 2022 and thus statistics from that time span is not included here.[5] MotoE gained World Championship status in 2023.\nThe Riders' World Championship is awarded to the most successful rider over a season, as determined by a points system based on Grand Prix results.

        "context": "\nThe Ballon d'Or (French pronunciation:[bal\u0254\u0303d\u0254\u0281]\u24d8; lit.'Golden Ball') is an annual football award presented by French news magazine France Football since 1956 and co-organized alongside UEFA since 2024. Between 2010 and 2015, in an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year (founded in 1991) and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. That partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award The Best FIFA Men's Player. The recipients of the joint FIFA Ballon d'Or are considered as winners by both award organisations.[2] Nevertheless, in recent times, critics have described the award as a \"popularity contest\", criticising its voting process, its bias in favour of attacking players, and for the idea of systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.[note 1]\nConceived by sports writers Gabriel Hanot and Jacques Ferran, the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year, based on voting by football journalists, from 1956 to 2006.[2] Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin that have been active at European clubs.[9][10]\nAfter 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote.[2] The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible.[11] In 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. They changed the timing so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season.[12] It was also decided that only those countries in the top 100 of the FIFA World Ranking would be allowed to vote.[12]\nThe Ballon d\u2019Or has historically been regarded as football's most prestigious and valuable individual award.[13] Nevertheless, in recent times, critics have described the award as a \"popularity contest\", criticising its voting process, its bias in favour of attacking players, and for the idea of systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.[note 1][2]\nStanley Matthews of England was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or.[14] Prior to 2007, the award was generally known as the continental European Footballer of the Year award in English language and much international media. Even after 2007, it was usually identified with and referred to by that name because of its origin as a European award, until it was merged with FIFA's World Player award cementing its new worldwide claim.[15][16][17][18] Liberia's George Weah, the only African recipient, became the first non-European to win the award in 1995, the year that rules of eligibility were changed.[10]Ronaldo of Brazil became the first South American winner two years later.[10]\nLionel Messi has won the award a record eight times, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with five. Messi is the only player in history to win the award with three different teams and also the only one to win it while playing outside Europe.[19] Three players have won the award three times each: Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten. With seven awards each, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French players have won the second most Ballons d'Or, underneath Argentina in first with eight. Players from Germany (1972, 1981) and the Netherlands (1988) occupied the top-three top spots in a single year (a feat achieved only three times in history). German (1972) and Italian (1988\u20131990) clubs achieved the same feat, including two individual years dominated by AC Milan players (1988, 1989), a unique record until Spanish clubs experienced an unforeseen dominance (2009\u20132012, 2015, 2016) and Barcelona (2010) became the second club to occupy the top-three. Two Spanish clubs, Barcelona and Real Madrid, also lead the ranking for producing the most winners, with 12 wins each.[20]\nBetween 2010 and 2015 inclusive, the award was merged with a similar one, the FIFA World Player of the Year award, to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or, which was awarded to the world's best male player before FIFA and France Football decided not to continue the merging agreement.[21] After 2011, UEFA created the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award to maintain the tradition of the original Ballon d'Or of specifically honouring a football player from Europe.[22]\nIn 2020, the Group L'\u00c9quipe, to which France Football belongs, decided that no award would be given for the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic cutting short the seasons of football clubs worldwide.[23] The widespread public opinion is that the 2020 award should have been given to Robert Lewandowski.[24][25][26]\nThe award shows a bias in favor of attacking players, which has increased in recent years, especially after 2007.[2] Over time, the award has gone to a more exclusive set of leagues and clubs.[2] Prior to 1995, 10 leagues supplied Ballon d'Or winners, whereas only England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have supplied winners since 1995.[2] Spain's La Liga has the most Ballon d'Or winners.[2] Barcelona and Real Madrid have supplied the most Ballon d'Or winners since 1995.[2]\nIn 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. They changed the timing so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season.[12] It was also decided that only those countries in the top 100 of the FIFA World Ranking would be allowed to vote. The plebiscite had previously been open to all countries since 2007. This brought the Ballon d'Or into line with the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award which was slightly less dominated by exclusive leagues and, in particular, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in recent years.[12]\nFrom 2024, UEFA will co-organize the Ballon D'or with France Football, with the magazine retaining the voting system and the Ballon d'Or name and UEFA organizing the awards gala.[27]\nLionel Messi has won the most Ballons d'Or in history, with eight wins in three different decades. He is also the record holder for most consecutive wins, with four between 2009 and 2012.\nNote: Until 2021, the Ballon d'Or was awarded based on player performance during the calendar year. Since 2022, jurors have been instructed to take into account the previous season.[28]\nCristiano Ronaldo has been nominated for the Ballon d'Or a record eighteen times, and is a five-time winner.[1]George Weah was the first non-European and first African national team player to win the award.Lev Yashin is the only goalkeeper to win the award.Franz Beckenbauer is the only defender to win the award twice.\nCristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi won 10 consecutive Ballon d'Or trophies between them from 2008 to 2017.Michel Platini won the award three years running (1983\u201385).Ronaldo Nazario is the youngest player to win the Ballon d'Or.Johan Cruyff (left) and Marco van Basten, both of the Netherlands, each won three times.\nIn addition Diego Maradona received an honorary Ballon d'Or in 1995 for his services to football dubbed the Golden Ballon d'Or.[32][33]Pel\u00e9 also received a similar award in January 2014 dubbed the FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or Prix d\u2019Honneur.[34]\nIn 2021 France Football awarded Robert Lewandowski with a Striker of the Year award for scoring the most goals the previous season. After Gerd M\u00fcller passing the award was renamed as the Gerd M\u00fcller Trophy.[36][37]\nA decade later, France Football voted Pel\u00e9 as the Football Player of the Century after consulting their former Ballon d'Or recipients. Among the 34 previous winners, 30 cast their votes, while Stanley Matthews, Omar S\u00edvori and George Best refused to vote, and Lev Yashin had died. Each voter was allotted five votes worth up to five points; however, Di St\u00e9fano only chose a first place, Platini a first and second place, and George Weah two players for fifth place. Pel\u00e9 was named the greatest by 17 voters, receiving almost double the number of points earned by the runner-up, Diego Maradona.[45][46]\nTo coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d'Or in 2016, France Football published a reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995, when only European players were eligible to win the award. 12 out of the 39 Ballons d'Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players; in addition to Pel\u00e9 and Diego Maradona, Garrincha, Mario Kempes, and Rom\u00e1rio were retrospectively recognized as worthy winners. The original recipients, however, remain unchanged.[47]",

Placekickers and punters are now allowed to wear numbers 0\u201349 and 90\u201399.

Three games are then scheduled on Christmas Day: Las Vegas at Kansas City, the New York Giants at Philadelphia and the regular Monday Night Football game: Baltimore at San Francisco.[89][90][91][92]\nAs part of new media agreements that were signed by the networks in 2021, the league's flexible scheduling system expands this season to include Monday Night Football games, and increase the amount of cross-flexing (switching) of Sunday afternoon games between CBS and Fox.[93][94][95] In May 2023, league owners then passed flex scheduling rules for Thursday Night Football as well, only as a trial basis for this season, and they would only carry over to 2024 if no TNF games are flexed in 2023.[96]\nMonday Night Football games can be flexed between weeks 12 and 17 in 2023, provided that the league announces their rescheduling no later than 12 days before the contests. The flex scheduling restriction for early season Sunday Night Football remains the same as in previous years, in that no more than two games may be flexed during the first two months of the season (between weeks 5 and 13 in 2023), with a 12-day advance notice. The deadline for flexing late season Sunday night games (between weeks 14 and 17 in 2023) has been extended this season, and the league can now give up to a six-day notice for these contests like in week 18.[97][98] For Thursday Night Football, only two games may be flexed between weeks 13 and 17, teams cannot play two away TNF games during season, the same team cannot be flexed into TNF both times, and the league must give a 28-day notice.[96]\nCBS and Fox will still be able to protect games from being moved to another network. When the initial season schedule is created, the two networks can select a limited amount of games involving a specific number of teams from their respective conference. Otherwise every game can be initially scheduled on any network regardless of conference.[94][99] After the season is underway, the two networks will be allowed to protect one game each week from getting flexed to another network.[95]\nWeek 18: All Week 18 games were initially listed with a kickoff time of \"TBD\".[102] Two games with playoff implications are planned to be moved to a Saturday, January 6, doubleheader at either 4:30 p.m., and 8:15 p.m. ET on both ESPN and ABC. Another game with playoff implications will be selected as the final NBC Sunday Night Football game at 8:20 p.m. ET. All remaining games will then be scheduled on Sunday afternoon at either 1:00 or 4:25 p.m. ET on either CBS or Fox.[103]\nThe 2023 playoffs are scheduled to begin with the wild-card round, with three wild-card games played in each conference. Wild Card Weekend is planned for January 13\u201315, 2024. In the Divisional round, scheduled for January 20\u201321, the top seed in the conference will play the lowest remaining seed and the other two remaining teams will play each other. The winners of those games will advance to the Conference Championship games scheduled for January 28. Super Bowl LVIII is scheduled for February 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada.\nTyreek Hill set the Super Bowl era record for most receiving yards through the first eight games of a season, with 1,014. The previous record of 978 yards was held by Torry Holt.[125]\nWeek 9\nC. J. Stroud set the record for most passing yards in a game by a rookie, with 470. The previous record of 453 was held by Marc Bulger.[126]\nStroud also tied the record for most passing touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with five. He shares the record with five other players.[127]\nStroud also became the first rookie to have at least 400 passing yards, four passing touchdowns, and no interceptions in a game.[128]\nA. J. Cole III set the record for gross punt average in a game, with 63.6 yards. The previous record of 63.0 yards was held by Andy Lee.[129]\nTaysom Hill became the first player in the Super Bowl era to have at least ten touchdowns passing, rushing, and receiving in his career.[128]\nJoshua Dobbs became the first player to have three touchdowns in back-to-back weeks while playing for different teams.[128]\nJalen Hurts tied the record for most rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in his first four seasons, with 33. He shares the record with Cam Newton.[128]\nBrandon Aubrey set the record for most consecutive field goals made without a miss to start his career, with 19. The previous record of 18 was held by Travis Coons.[128]\nAll four teams in the AFC North had a record of at least two games above .500 after this week concluded, marking the first time all four teams in one division were two games or more above .500 after Week 9 since the 2002 divisional realignment.[130]\nOn September 29, the NFL revised the gambling policy. Betting on NFL games will incur a minimum ban of one year, providing inside information will incur an indefinite ban with a one year minimum, and match fixing or attempted match fixing will result in a lifetime ban. The penalties for betting on other sports at NFL facilities were reduced to a two-game ban for first-time offenders, a six-game ban for second-time offenders, and a minimum one year ban for further infractions. This resulted in Williams and Petit-Frere being immediately reinstated.[158]\nAll players suspended indefinitely are allowed to apply for reinstatement after the 2023 season.\nAfter a 1\u20134 start, Rhule was fired on October 10, 2022, after more than two seasons with the team. During his tenure, the Panthers were 11\u201327 (.289) with no playoff appearances.\nWilks, the team's defensive pass game coordinator and secondary coach, took over as interim coach. This is his second NFL head coaching position, having previously been the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals for one season.[161]\nReich was hired on January 26. As the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts from 2018 to 2022, he compiled a record of 40\u201333\u20131 (.547), with two playoff appearances and a 1\u20132 (.333) playoff record.[162]\nHackett was fired on December 26, 2022, after a 4\u201311 (.267) tenure, missing the playoffs in his only partial season with the team.[163][164]\nRosburg, the team's senior assistant to the head coach, was named interim head coach. This is his first head coaching position; he previously served as the Baltimore Ravens special team coordinator for eleven seasons.[165]\nReich was fired on November 7, 2022, after starting the season 3\u20135\u20131 (.389). In 5+ seasons with the Colts, Reich was 40\u201333\u20131 (.547), with 2 wild card playoff appearances and a playoff record of 1\u20132 (.333).[169]\nSaturday, a 6-time Pro Bowler who played thirteen seasons as a center in the NFL (twelve of them for the Colts), and consultant for the team, was named interim head coach. His only previous coaching experience at any level was for Hebron Christian Academy in Dacula, Georgia.[170]\nSteichen, who spent the previous two seasons as the Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator, was hired on February 14. This is his first head coaching position at any level.[171]\nRobinson was fired on December 6, 2022, after more than six seasons as the Titans' GM, despite a relatively successful tenure with the Titans, including two AFC South titles, four playoff appearances, and an AFC Championship appearance in 2019.\nCowden, the team's vice president of player personnel, served as interim GM for the rest of the season.[177]\nCarthon was hired on January 18. He had been in management positions with several teams since 2008, after playing two seasons with the Indianapolis Colts from 2004 to 2006. His most recent position was as the San Francisco 49ers' director of pro/player personnel since 2017.[178]\nSeveral NFL teams switched to using Nike\u2019s new Vapor F.U.S.E uniform template, this after Seattle had a brief trial run during the 2020 season.[183][184]\nArizona introduced a new uniform design for 2023.[185] The new designs feature simplified uniform striping. The previous color scheme was retained with silver added as an accent color.[186] A large \"Arizona\" word mark was added above the numbers on the home uniform. The home uniform's numbers are accented with a silver outline and forgoes a sleeve pattern included on the alternate and away jerseys. The away uniform is white with red numbers that are outlined with black trim, and red and silver stripes along the pants and sleeves. The alternate uniform is black with red numbers outlined in silver. Arizona's primary helmet was modified to feature silver facemasks, silver reflective flakes on the shell, and a larger logo.[187][188]\nCarolina adjusted the team's shade of blue. The team will retain its preexisting uniform design otherwise, with a modification to the jersey's shoulder stripes.[189][190]\nIndianapolis implemented a new alternate uniform dubbed \"Indiana Nights.\" The design features a heather fabric pattern displayed on blue jerseys and blue pants with white numbers outlined in black. A new black helmet accompanies the uniform.[191][192]\nMinnesota introduced a new throwback uniform similar to the design worn during the 1960s and 1970s. The helmet will be modified to include a gray facemask in place of the team's standard black facemask, and will feature an altered logo to more closely resemble the era's design. They will be worn for one game.[193][194][195]\nThe New York Jets will debut a throwback uniform dubbed \"Legacy White\" inspired by a former design worn by the team from 1978\u20131989.[196] The uniform will be featured in two home games.[197]\nPhiladelphia reinstated its Kelly green throwback uniforms for the 2023 season.[198] This iteration is modeled after the set worn from 1985 to 1995 and will be worn for two games.[199] The Eagles last featured Kelly green uniforms during the 2010 season.[200][201]\nSeattle will reintroduce its 1990s era uniforms as a part of the \"NFL's classic uniform program\" during the 2023 season.[202] They will be worn for two games.[203][204] The throwback combination replaces Seattle's grey alternate due to NFL rules limiting teams to a maximum of four uniforms.[205]\nTampa Bay reinstated the orange throwback \"creamsicle\" uniforms worn from 1976\u20131996. The team intended to wear the design during the 2022 season but delayed its reintroduction until 2023, citing supply chain issues.[206][207] The team wore this design for one game and for the first time since the 2012 season.[208]\nCleveland introduced a white helmet with an orange and brown center stripe. The helmet will be worn with the team's 1946 throwback uniforms, which were previously introduced in 2021.[216] It will be worn for three games.[217][218]\nDenver will wear a white alternate helmet adorned with decals based on the team logo introduced in 1968. The helmet's decals and stripes are similar to the ones used with Denver's 2016 \"Color Rush\" combination. The helmet will be paired with those uniforms.[219][220][221]\nDetroit introduced an alternate helmet. The helmet's shell is Honolulu blue and features decals based on the team logo used from 1961 to 1969.[222][223][224][225] The helmet will be paired with Detroit's all-grey alternate uniform.\nIndianapolis revealed a new helmet worn with the aforementioned \"Indiana Nights\" alternate uniform. The helmet's shell is black and includes the team logo outlined in white.[191][226]\nMinnesota will pair the throwback uniform listed above with a helmet featuring a deeper purple hue reminiscent of the era in which the uniform was inspired.[195]\nPhiladelphia will pair the throwback uniform listed above with the helmet of that era: a Kelly green shell with silver eagle wing decals outlined in white and a gray facemask. This will replace the black helmet used with the team's black alternate uniform the previous season.\nSeattle will pair the throwback uniform listed above with the classic silver helmet featuring the original team logo.\nMinnesota will accompany their throwback uniform with a patch honoring their late former head coach Bud Grant, who died earlier in the year. The patch features Grant's signature and will be worn for one game. The patch's design will be featured as a decal on the team's helmet throughout the rest of the season.[232][233]\nThis is the first season under 11-year U.S. media rights agreements with CBS, Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC, renewing their existing regular season AFC, NFC, Sunday Night Football, and Monday Night Football packages, respectively, through the 2033 season. The contracts keep CBS, NBC, and ESPN's digital rights to stream their respective live games on their respective paid over-the-top subscription streaming platforms, Paramount+, Peacock, and ESPN+ (Fox does not have a dedicated paid streaming platform). Fox, NBC, and ESPN may continue to offer Spanish-language versions of their games on their respective Spanish-language outlets Fox Deportes, Telemundo Deportes, and ESPN Deportes (CBS does not have a specific platform for Spanish-language sports content, although it may continue to sub-license Spanish-language rights of its Super Bowl coverage).[234] Changes beginning this regular season include the following:[235][93][236][237]\nFlexible scheduling has been expanded to include Monday Night Football, and increase the amount of \"cross-flexing\" (switching) Sunday afternoon games between CBS and Fox. When the initial schedule is created, CBS and Fox will be able to specify a limited amount of games involving teams from their respective conference that they want to air, but otherwise the league will be free to schedule games regardless of conference. CBS and Fox will then also be able to protect one game each per week from getting flexed into another network (see \u00a7 Changes to flexible scheduling rules above).[99][95][236]\nThere will be three weeks featuring two Monday Night Football games split between ABC and ESPN, expanding from one in the 2022 season.[235][236]\nNBC will exclusively stream one national regular season game on Peacock per season. Like other games exclusively on cable or streamed online, it will also be made available on over-the-air television stations in each participating team's local market.[236][235][238]\nOn September 18, ABC announced that due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes all MNF games this season would be simulcast on ABC (except on weeks when two games are being played at the same time). It will be the first time since 2005 ABC has aired a full season of MNF.[241]\nThe 2023 season will be the second season of scheduling three games on Christmas Day, consisting of an afternoon doubleheader split between CBS and Fox, and that week's Monday Night Football contest. This Monday Night Football game will only exclusively air on ABC due to ESPN's coverage of NBA Christmas games.[92][245] CBS's game will also feature a youth-friendly broadcast on sister network Nickelodeon for the second consecutive year. With New Year's Day also falling on a Monday this season, the Monday Night Football game that weekend was instead moved to Saturday, December 30, in deference to the New Year's Day college football bowl games.[92][245]\nThis is the third year of ESPN's four-year partnership deal with Omaha Productions for their popular Manningcast series, which airs on ESPN2, and is simulcast on ESPN+ for select games shown on both ESPN and ABC.\nThis is the second season of a 12-year deal with Amazon Prime Video and Twitch to exclusively stream Thursday Night Football.[246][247][248] For 2023, flex scheduling has also been expanded to Thursday Night Football on a one year trial.[96] In addition, Thursday Night Football will add a game the Friday afternoon after Thanksgiving; unlike the other TNF games, whose free broadcasts are exclusive to sister live streaming platform Twitch, this game will also be carried for free within the main Amazon Prime Video platform.[87][249][250]\nThis will also be the second season that ESPN+ exclusively streams one International Series game.[251] On September 11, 2023, it was announced that there will be a youth-oriented alternate broadcast streaming on both ESPN+ and Disney+, using the league's player tracking data to render a live animated version of the game portrayed by characters from the Toy Story franchise.[252]\nThe league's streaming service NFL+ adds live access to NFL Network on it base tier and NFL RedZone on its premium tier. The service will continue to live stream in-market regular season and postseason games on mobile devices only, radio broadcasts for all games, and most out-of-market preseason games on its base tier; and replays of all games and coaches film on its premium tier.[253][254]\nThree of the Wild Card games will be aired by NBC this season, holding rights to the Saturday afternoon game under its annual rotation with CBS and Fox since 2020, the Sunday night game under the third year of a separate seven-year deal, and the Saturday night game\u2014which will be streamed exclusively by Peacock under a one-year, $110 million deal. This will mark the first time that an NFL playoff game is carried exclusively by a streaming platform outside of the participating teams' markets.[255][256][257] ESPN will be entering its third year of their five-year deal for the Monday night Wild Card game,[236][237][258] and the remaining two Sunday afternoon games will be carried by CBS and Fox.[236][237][239][259]\nThe four broadcast television partners will now each air one Divisional Playoff game per season. ESPN/ABC takes over the slot that was previously rotated between CBS and Fox.[236][260]\nThe new TV deals also adds ESPN/ABC simulcasts to the annual Super Bowl rotation, with ABC returning for the first time since Super Bowl XL. CBS will televise Super Bowl LVIII this season, followed by Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC.[236][234] In May 2023, CBS announced that it had sub-licensed the Spanish-language rights for Super Bowl LVIII to TelevisaUnivision, replacing ESPN Deportes, who held the agreement for the three previous Super Bowl games aired by CBS.[234] Nickelodeon will also have a youth-friendly broadcast of the game.[261]\nOn March 28, 2023, the NFL announced that the commercial rights to Sunday Ticket would be held by EverPass Media, a new company funded by RedBird Capital and the NFL's venture capital arm 32 Equity. EverPass distribute NFL Sunday Ticket to bars, restaurants, and other commercial venues via existing cable and satellite providers under non-exclusive agreements.[266] EverPass reached its first agreement with DirecTV on May 25, 2023.[267]\nThis is the second season of the NFL's current radio contract with Westwood One, including rights to all primetime, marquee, and playoff games, along with audio coverage of other events such as the NFL Draft and NFL Honors.[268]\nOn February 7, 2023, the NFL announced a new deal with DAZN to become the worldwide rightsholder of its NFL Game Pass streaming service outside of the U.S. and China. DAZN had already held the rights to Game Pass and Sunday Ticket in Canada.[274]\nIn the United Kingdom, Sky Sports will continue to broadcast two selected non-national games live every Sunday, one early and one late window game respectively. The Sky Sports Mix channel will continue to air a live simulcast of NFL Network\u2019s NFL RedZone whip-around show. Sky Sports will also continue to broadcast every Sunday Night Football, Monday Night Football (including doubleheaders) and Thursday NightFootball game live.",

        "context": "\nThis is a list of winners and nominees of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series[1] since its institution in 1951. The award goes to the producers of the series. The award is often cited as one of the \"main awards\" at the Emmys ceremonies.[2]\nSince its institution in 1951 the award has changed names many times in its history. It was first called Best Dramatic Show from 1951 to 1954, then Best Dramatic Series in 1955 and 1956. In 1957, no specific award for drama was given, but in 1958 the category was split into two separate categories, Best Dramatic Anthology Series, and Best Dramatic Series with Continuing Characters with a winner selected from each category. The following year, the category was differently split into two separate categories, Best Dramatic Series \u2013 Less Than One Hour. In 1960, the name was changed yet again to Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Drama; this name was kept from 1960 to 1964. In 1966, it had its sixth name change to Outstanding Dramatic Series or Outstanding Series-Drama; this was used from 1966 until recently, when it became Outstanding Drama Series.\n^In 1953, two separate series categories existed, Best Dramatic Program and Best Mystery, Action or Adventure Program, and an award was given in each category. Robert Montgomery Presents won Best Dramatic Program, while Dragnet won Best Mystery, Action or Adventure Program.\n^In 1954, two separate series categories existed, Best Dramatic Program and Best Mystery, Action or Adventure Program, and an award was given in each category. The United States Steel Hour won Best Dramatic Program, while Dragnet won Best Mystery, Action or Adventure Program.\n^In 1955, three separate series categories existed, Best Dramatic Series, Best Mystery or Intrigue Series and Best Western or Adventure Series, and an award was given in each category. The United States Steel Hour won Best Dramatic Series, Dragnet won Best Mystery or Intrigue Series, while Stories of the Century won Best Action or Adventure Series.\n^In 1956, two separate series categories existed, Best Dramatic Series and Best Action or Adventure Series, and an award was given in each category. Producers' Showcase won Best Dramatic Series, while Disneyland won Best Action or Adventure Series.\n^In 1957, two separate series categories existed, Best Series \u2013 Half Hour or Less and Best Series \u2013 One Hour or More, and an award was given in each category. The Phil Silvers Show, a comedy, won Best Series \u2013 Half Hour or Less, while Caesar's Hour, another comedy, won Best Series \u2013 One Hour or More. For this year (and also in 1965), dramas competed directly against comedies, musical variety, and other shows.\n^In 1958, two separate drama series categories existed, Best Dramatic Series with Continuing Characters and Best Dramatic Anthology Series, and an award was given in each category. Gunsmoke won Best Dramatic Series with Continuing Characters, while Playhouse 90 won Best Dramatic Anthology Series.\n^In 1959, three separate drama series categories existed, Best Dramatic Series \u2013 Less Than One Hour, Best Dramatic Series-One Hour or Longer and Best Western Series, and an award was given in each category. Alcoa-Goodyear Theatre won Best Dramatic Series-Less Than One Hour, Playhouse 90 won Best Dramatic Series \u2013 One Hour or Longer, while Maverick won Best Western Series.\n^For 1965 only, the Emmy Award categories were reduced so that comedy, drama, variety, and music programs competed against each other, with multiple winners possible in each category.\n^In 1988, Rumpole of the Bailey was added to this category after it was nominated and disqualified in the Miniseries category.\nA : While Law & Order is primarily a procedural, its Emmy-winning seventh season had a three-episode arc, while the episode \"Entrapment\" was a sequel to season 3's \"Conspiracy\" .\nB : The sixth season of The Sopranos was split into two parts. They are both considered season 6.\nC : The fifth season of Breaking Bad was split into two parts. They are both considered season 5.\nD : The seventh season of Mad Men was split into two parts. They are both considered season 7.\nE : The sixth season of Better Call Saul was split into two parts. They are both considered season 6.",

        "context": "\nPerson of the Year (called Man of the Year or Woman of the Year until 1999)[1] is an annual issue of the American news magazine and website Time featuring a person, a group, idea, or object that \"for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year\".[2] The editors select the featured subject, though the Time website also runs an annual reader's poll that has no effect on the selection.[3]\nThe tradition of selecting a \"Man of the Year\" began in 1927, with Time editors contemplating the news makers of the year. The idea was also an attempt to remedy the editorial embarrassment earlier that year of not having aviator Charles Lindbergh on its cover following his historic transatlantic flight. By the end of the year, it was decided that a cover story featuring Lindbergh as the Man of the Year would serve both purposes.[4]\nSince the list began, every serving president of the United States has been a Man or Person of the Year at least once, with the exceptions of Calvin Coolidge (in office at the time of the first issue), Herbert Hoover (the subsequent president), and Gerald Ford (the only president never to have been elected to the office of president or vice president). Most were named Man or Person of the Year either the year they were elected or while they were in office; the only one to be given the title before being elected was Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1944, as Supreme Commander of the Allied Invasion Force, eight years before his first election. He subsequently received the title again in 1959 while in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first chosen US president and is the only person to have received the title three times, first as president-elect (1932) and later as the incumbent president (1934 and 1941).\nAll countries' heads of state or government to have been chosen as Man, Woman, or Person of the Year (arranged in chronological order by country name, from the most frequently selected) are:\nBefore 1999, four women were granted the title as individuals: three as \"Woman of the Year\"\u2014Wallis Simpson (1936), Queen Elizabeth II (1952), and Corazon Aquino (1986)\u2014and one as half of \"Man and Wife of the Year\", Soong Mei-ling (jointly with Chiang Kai-shek) in 1937.[5] \"American Women\" were recognized as a group in 1975. Other classes of people recognized comprise both men and women, such as \"Hungarian Freedom Fighters\" (1956), \"U.S. Scientists\" (1960), \"The Inheritors\" (1966), \"The Middle Americans\" (1969), \"The American Soldier\" (1950 and 2003), \"You\" (2006), \"The Protester\" (2011), and \"Ebola Fighters\" (2014). However, the title on the magazine remained \"Man of the Year\" for both the 1956 \"Hungarian Freedom Fighter\" and the 1966 \"Twenty-five and Under\" editions which both featured a woman standing behind a man, and \"Men of the Year\" on the 1960 \"U.S. Scientists\" edition which exclusively featured men on its cover. It was not until the 1969 edition on \"The Middle Americans\" that the title embraced \"Man and Woman of the Year\".\nDespite the name, the title is not just granted to individuals. Pairs of people such as married couples and political opponents, classes of people, and inanimate objects have all been selected for the special year-end issue.\nDespite the magazine's frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people.[13] However, Time points out that controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938); Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942); Nikita Khrushchev (1957); and Ayatollah Khomeini (1979) have also been granted the title for their impact on events.[14] Nevertheless, as a result of the public backlash it received from the American audience for naming Khomeini Man of the Year in 1979, the magazine's editors have since shied away from using figures who are controversial in the United States for commercial reasons, fearing reductions in sales or advertising revenue.[15]\nTime's Person of the Year for 2001, immediately following the September 11 attacks, was Rudy Giuliani, who served as mayor of New York City during that time.[16] The stated rules of selection\u2014the individual or group of individuals who have had the bigger influence on the year's events\u2014made Osama bin Laden the more likely choice that year; however, Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the attacks, in the same way that Albert Einstein was selected Person of the Century for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder instead of Adolf Hitler, who was arguably a stronger candidate.[17] The selections were ultimately based on, as the magazine describes it, \"who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most.\"\nIn 1941, the fictional elephant Dumbo from Walt Disney's animated film of the same name was selected to be \"Mammal of the Year\", and a cover was created showing the title character in a formal portrait style. However, the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 pre-empted the cover. The U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was named Man of the Year for a record third time, although Dumbo's Mammal of the Year profile still appeared on the inside pages of the magazine.[18]\nFilmmaker Michael Moore claims that director Mel Gibson cost him the opportunity to be Person of the Year alongside Gibson in 2004. Moore's controversial political documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 became the highest-grossing documentary of all time the same year Gibson's The Passion of the Christ became a box-office success and also caused significant controversy. Moore said in an interview \"I got a call right after the '04 election from an editor from Time Magazine. He said,' Time Magazine has picked you and Mel Gibson to be Time's Person of the Year to put on the cover, Right and Left, Mel and Mike. The only thing you have to do is pose for a picture with each other. And do an interview together.' I said 'OK.' They call Mel up, he agrees. They set the date and time in LA. I'm to fly there. He's flying from Australia. Something happens when he gets home... Next thing, Mel calls up and says, 'I'm not doing it. I've thought it over and it is not the right thing to do.' So they put Bush on the cover.\"[19]\nOn November 24, 2017, US president Donald Trump, who had this title the previous year, posted on the social media network Twitter that Time editors had told him he would \"probably\" be named Person of the Year for a second time, conditional on an interview and photo shoot, which he had refused. Time denied that they had made any such promises or conditions to Trump, who was named a runner-up.[20]\nLaval was first appointed Prime Minister of France in 1931. He was popular in the American press at the time for opposing the Hoover Moratorium, a temporary freeze on World War I debt payments that was disliked in both France and the US.[21]\nIn 1933, Johnson was appointed director of the National Recovery Administration. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave him the task of bringing industry, labor and government together to create codes of \"fair practices\" and set prices.\nRepresenting a generation of American men and women, aged 25 and under \u2013 the Baby Boom generation, who in 1966 made up nearly half the population and were influential both in the counterculture of the 1960s and as drafted soldiers in the Vietnam War. The face most prominently seen on the cover representing the generation was that of Thomas M. McLaughlin.[29][30]\nJohnson was President of the United States from 1963 to 1969. Time noted that it had been a year of setbacks and failures for Johnson, with race riots across the US, deepening involvement in the Vietnam War, and the Dump Johnson movement within his own party.[31]\nIn 1968, the American crew of Apollo 8 (William Anders, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell) became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit, orbiting the Moon and paving the way for the first manned Moon landings in 1969.\nAs President of the United States, Nixon visited China in 1972, the first U.S. president to do so. Nixon later secured the SALT I pact with the Soviet Union before being re-elected in one of the largest landslide election victories in American history.\nAndropov, as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was a critic of the Strategic Defense Initiative and tried to revive stagnating Soviet economy. Andropov was hospitalized in August 1983 and subsequently died in 1984.\nAs General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and leader of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev oversaw perestroika and glasnost political reforms in 1987, aimed at liberalizing the Soviet society.\nFounder of the social-networking website Facebook. In 2010, Facebook passed half a billion users but was involved in privacy disputes, and Zuckerberg had been the subject of the Oscar-winning biopicThe Social Network.\nThe people who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment, including the figureheads of the American MeToo movement. Represented on the cover by strawberry picker Isabel Pascual (pseudonym), lobbyist Adama Iwu, actress Ashley Judd, software engineer Susan Fowler, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, and a sixth woman, a hospital worker who wished to remain anonymous and whose face cannot be seen.\nTime also holds an online poll for the readers to vote for who they believe to be the Person of the Year. While many mistakenly believe the winner of the poll to be the Person of the Year, the title, as mentioned above, is decided by the editors of Time.[154]Time continues to annually run an online poll for the \"People's Choice\", but stresses the decision on whom the magazine recognizes is not made by the poll, but by the magazine's editors.[155] The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2022 was the first person to both win the online poll and become Person of the Year. An online reader's choice poll was held in 1998, with professional wrestler Mick Foley and murdered college student Matthew Shepard as the top vote-getters, although the final result is unknown.[156][71]",

        "effective_year": "2022",
        "context": "\nSame-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is the marriage of two people of the same legal sex. As of 2023,[update] marriage between same-sex couples is legally performed and recognized in 34[1] countries that have a total population of more than 1 billion people (17% of the world's population), with the most recent being Andorra. It will become legal in a 35th country, Estonia, on 1 January 2024.\nAdoption rights are not necessarily covered, though most states with same-sex marriage allow those couples to jointly adopt as other married couples can. In contrast, 35 countries (as of 2023) have definitions of marriage in their constitutions that prevent marriage between couples of the same sex, most enacted in recent decades as a preventative measure. Some other countries have constitutionally mandated Islamic law, which is generally interpreted as prohibiting marriage between same-sex couples. In six of the former and most of the latter, homosexuality itself is criminalized. There are records of marriage between men dating back to the first century.[2] It is legally recognized in a large majority of the world's developeddemocracies; notable exceptions are Italy, Japan, South Korea, Greece and the Czech Republic. It is not yet recognized in any of the world's Islamic polities. Some countries, such as China and Russia, restrict advocacy for same-sex marriage.[3][4]\nScientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical well-being of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of same-sex parents benefit from being raised by married same-sex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions. Social science research indicates that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against gay and lesbian people, with research repudiating the notion that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon restricting marriage to heterosexuals.[9][10][11] Same-sex marriage can provide those in committed same-sex relationships with relevant government services and make financial demands on them comparable to that required of those in opposite-sex marriages, and also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights.[12] Opposition is based on claims such as that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples. These claims are refuted by scientific studies, which show that homosexuality is a natural and normal variation in human sexuality, that sexual orientation is not a choice, and that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as the children of opposite-sex couples.[13]\nTwo men marry, surrounded by wedding party, in New Orleans, United States on 11 November 2017\nSome proponents of the legal recognition of same-sex marriage\u2014such as Marriage Equality USA (founded in 1998), Freedom to Marry (founded in 2003), and Canadians for Equal Marriage - used the terms marriage equality and equal marriage to signal that their goal was for same-sex marriage to be recognized on equal ground with opposite-sex marriage.[14][15][16][17][18][19] The Associated Press recommends the use of same-sex marriage over gay marriage.[20] In deciding whether to use the term gay marriage, it may also be noted that not everyone in a same-sex marriage is gay - for example, some are bisexual - and therefore using the term gay marriage is sometimes considered erasure of such people.[21][22]\nAnthropologists have struggled to determine a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures around the world.[23][24] Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including those of more than 30 African peoples, such as the Kikuyu and Nuer.[24][25][26]\nWith several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word marriage to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.[27][28] The Oxford English Dictionary has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.[29]\nA reference to marriage between same-sex couples appears in the Sifra, which was written in the 3rd century CE. The Book of Leviticus prohibited homosexual relations, and the Hebrews were warned not to \"follow the acts of the land of Egypt or the acts of the land of Canaan\" (Lev. 18:22, 20:13). The Sifra clarifies what these ambiguous \"acts\" were, and that they included marriage between same-sex couples: \"A man would marry a man and a woman a woman, a man would marry a woman and her daughter, and a woman would be married to two men.\"[31]\nWhat is arguably the first historical mention of the performance of marriages between same-sex couples occurred during the early Roman Empire according to controversial[32] historian John Boswell.[33] These were usually reported in a critical or satirical manner.[34]\nAccording to Craig A. Williams, some Romans as early as the first century clearly did participate in formal ceremonies in which two males were married. These marriages were seen as atypical: Williams writes that \"a marriage between two fully gendered 'men' was inconceivable; if two males were joined together, one of them had to be 'the woman.'\"[39]\nThe first Roman emperor to have married a man was Nero, who is reported to have married two other males on different occasions. The first was with one of Nero's own freedmen, Pythagoras, with whom Nero took the role of the bride.[40] Later, as a groom, Nero married Sporus, a young boy, to replace his wife Poppaea Sabina following her death,[41][42] and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that Nero had killed and act as though they were really married.[41] A friend gave the \"bride\" away as required by law. The marriage was celebrated in both Greece and Rome in extravagant public ceremonies.[43]\nConubium existed only between a civis Romanus and a civis Romana (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).[44] Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, \"matrimonium was then an institution involving a mother, mater. The idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, in matrimonium ducere, so that he might have children by her.\"[45]\nIn 342 AD, Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans issued a law in the Theodosian Code (C. Th. 9.7.3) prohibiting marriage between same-sex couples in Rome and ordering execution for those so married.[46] Professor Fontaine of Cornell University Classics Department has pointed out that there is no provision for marriage between same-sex couples in Roman Law, and the text from 342 CE is corrupt, \"marries a woman\" might be \"goes to bed in a dishonorable manner with a man\" as a condemnation of homosexual behavior between men.[47]\nIn 1989, Denmark became the first country to legally recognize a relationship for same-sex couples, establishing registered partnerships, which gave those in same-sex relationships \"most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child\".[53] In 2001, the continental Netherlands became the first country to broaden marriage laws to include same-sex couples.[6][54] Since then, same-sex marriage has been established by law in 34 other countries, including most of the Americas and Western Europe. Yet its spread has been uneven \u2014 South Africa is the only country in Africa to take the step; Taiwan the only one in Asia.[55]\nOn 12 March 2015, the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution encouraging EU institutions and member states to \"[reflect] on the recognition of same-sex marriage or same-sex civil union as a political, social and human and civil rights issue\".[74][75] In 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that all signatory countries must allow same-sex marriage.\nIn response to the international spread of same-sex marriage, a number of countries have enacted preventative constitutional bans, with the most recent being Russia in 2020 and Mali in 2023. In other countries, constitutions have been adopted which have wording specifying that marriage is between a man and a woman, although, especially with the older constitutions, they were not necessarily worded with the intent to ban same-sex marriage.[citation needed] In additional countries, such restrictions and limitations are effected through legislation.\nSame-sex marriage banned by constitutionally mandated Islamic law or morality\nSame-sex marriage banned for Muslims\nNo constitutional ban\nIn 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in Schalk and Kopf v Austria, a case involving an Austrian same-sex couple who were denied the right to marry.[76] The court found, by a vote of 4 to 3, that their human rights had not been violated.[77] The court further stated that same-sex unions are not protected under art. 12 of ECHR (\"Right to marry\"), which exclusively protects the right to marry of opposite-sex couples (without regard if the sex of the partners is the result of birth or of sex change), but they are protected under art. 8 of ECHR (\"Right to respect for private and family life\") and art. 14 (\"Prohibition of discrimination\"). Furthermore, under European Convention of Human Rights, states are not obliged to allow same-sex marriage:[78]\nThe Court acknowledged that a number of Contracting States had extended marriage to same-sex partners, but went on to say that this reflected their own vision of the role of marriage in their societies and did not flow from an interpretation of the fundamental right as laid down by the Contracting States in the Convention in 1950. The Court concluded that it fell within the State's margin of appreciation as to how to regulate the effects of the change of gender on pre-existing marriages.\nBritish Judge Sir Nicolas Bratza, then head of the European Court of Human Rights, delivered a speech in 2012 that signaled the court was ready to declare same-sex marriage a \"human right\", as soon as enough countries fell into line.[79][80]\nArticle 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that: \"Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right\",[81] not limiting marriage to those in a heterosexual relationship. However, the ECHR stated in Schalk and Kopf v Austria that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term \"men and women\" instead of \"everyone\".[76]\nOn 5 June 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled, in a case from Romania, that, under the specific conditions of the couple in question, married same-sex couples have the same residency rights as other married couples in an EU country, even if that country does not permit or recognize same-sex marriage.[83][84] However, the ruling was not implemented in Romania and on 14 September 2021 the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on the European Commission to ensure that the ruling is respected across the EU.[85][86]\nAlexandra Ch\u00e1vez and Michelle Avil\u00e9s, the first same-sex couple to marry in Ecuador\nThe Court said that governments \"must recognize and guarantee all the rights that are derived from a family bond between people of the same sex\". They also said that it was inadmissible and discriminatory for a separate legal provision to be established (such as civil unions) instead of same-sex marriage. The Court demanded that governments \"guarantee access to all existing forms of domestic legal systems, including the right to marriage, in order to ensure the protection of all the rights of families formed by same-sex couples without discrimination\". Recognizing the difficulty in passing such laws in countries where there is strong opposition to same-sex marriage, it recommended that governments pass temporary decrees until new legislation is brought in.[87]\nThe ruling has directly led to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Costa Rica and Ecuador. In the wake of the ruling, lawsuits regarding same-sex marriage were filed in Bolivia, Honduras,[88] Panama,[89] Paraguay (to recognize marriages performed abroad),[90] and Peru,[91] all of which are under the jurisdiction of the IACHR.\nThe terms of employment of the staff of international organizations (not commercial) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.\nDespite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the United Nations recognize same-sex marriages if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.[92] In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or domestic partners of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the World Bank does recognize domestic partners.[93]\nFemale same-sex marriage is practiced among the Gikuyu, Nandi, Kamba, Kipsigis, and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples. About 5\u201310% of women are in such marriages. However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family.[103]\nAmong the Igbo people and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage.[104]\nThe results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies.[11]\nA study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among school students in grades 9\u201312 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among high schoolers of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9\u201312 declined by 14% in states that established same-sex marriage, resulting in about 134,000 fewer attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among youth in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among youth in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among teenage youth occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage.[106][107] The lead researcher of the study stated that \"laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future\".[108][109][110]\nProfessional organizations of psychologists have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions, e.g. civil marriage. For example, the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) stated in 2006 that \"parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union.\"[111] The CPA has stated that the stress encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent.[111]\nThere is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment... The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.[112]\nThe American Psychological Association stated in 2004: \"Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on.\" It has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, \"are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples\", which has adverse effects on the well-being of same-sex partners.[113]\nAs of 2006[update], the data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.[112][114]\nIn 2009, a pair of economists at Emory University tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the United States to an increase in the rates of HIV infection.[115][116] The study linked the passage of a same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.[117] In 2010, a Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of anxiety disorders, among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.[118][119]\nWhile few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the historical and anthropological record reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation.[citation needed] Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising,[120] undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.[121] Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,[122] while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.[k] The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety of other issues.[citation needed]\nScientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex parents or carers.[123][111][124][125][126]\nScientific research has been generally consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents.[111][126][127][128] According to scientific literature reviews, there is no evidence to the contrary.[112][129][130][131]\nNo laws allowing adoption by same-sex couples and no same-sex marriage\nSame-sex marriage but adoption by married same-sex couples not allowed\nAll states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint adoption of children by those couples with the exceptions of Ecuador and a third of states in Mexico, though such restrictions have been ruled unconstitutional in Mexico. In addition, Bolivia, Croatia, Israel and Liechtenstein, which do not recognize same-sex marriage nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples. Some additional states that do not recognize same-sex marriage allow stepchild adoption by couples in civil unions: Estonia, Italy (on a case-by-case basis) and San Marino.\nAs of 2010, more than 16,000 same-sex couples were raising an estimated 22,000 adopted children in the United States,[132] 4% of all adopted children.[133]\nA gay or bisexual man has the option of surrogacy, the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through artificial insemination or carries another woman's surgically implanted fertilized egg to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.[134][135] Whether these arrangements are legal are subject to controversy in several jurisdictions.[136]\nThe legal status of same-sex marriage may have implications for the marriages of couples in which one or both parties are transgender, depending on how sex is defined within a jurisdiction. Transgender and intersex individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the \"opposite\" sex or permitted to marry partners of the \"same\" sex due to legal distinctions.[citation needed] In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.[137]\nIn the United Kingdom, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person had to dissolve their civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate[citation needed], and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.[138] In Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.[139] In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages was subject to legal complications.[140] As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state,[141] as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.[142]\nThere are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A \"majority rules\" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.[144]\nIn contrast, a civil rights view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.[145]\nNumerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted. A trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across many countries of the world, often driven in large part by a generational difference in support. Polling that was conducted in developed democracies in this century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.[147][148][149][150][151][needs update]\nVarious detailed polls and studies on same-sex marriage that were conducted in several countries show that support for same-sex marriage significantly increases with higher levels of education and is also significantly stronger among younger generations, with a clear trend of continually increasing support.[152][153][154][155][156][needs update]\n^Same-sex marriage is performed and recognized by law in all fifty states of the US and in the District of Columbia, in all overseas territories except American Samoa, and in all tribal nations that do not have their own marriage laws, as well as in most nations that do. The largest of the dozen or so known exceptions among the federal reservations are Navajo and Gila River, and the largest among the shared-sovereignty Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Areas are the Creek and Citizen Potawatomi. These polities ban same-sex marriage and do not recognize marriages from other jurisdictions, though members may still marry under state law and be accorded all the rights of marriage under state and federal law.\n^Legally available in the Arizona municipalities of Bisbee, Clarkdale, Cottonwood, Jerome, Sedona and Tucson.\n^Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view.

        "context": "\nJeopardy! is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. The show is a quiz competition that reverses the traditional question-and-answer format of many quiz shows. Rather than being given questions, contestants are instead given general knowledge clues in the form of answers and they must identify the person, place, thing, or idea that the clue describes, phrasing each response in the form of a question.\nThe original daytime version debuted on NBC on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A nighttime syndicated edition aired weekly from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, The All-New Jeopardy!, ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979 on weekdays. The syndicated show familiar to modern viewers and aired daily (currently by Sony Pictures Television[a]) premiered on September 10, 1984.\nArt Fleming served as host for all versions of the show between 1964 and 1979. Don Pardo served as announcer until 1975, and John Harlan announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. The daily syndicated version premiered in 1984 with Alex Trebek as host and Johnny Gilbert as announcer. Trebek hosted until his death, with his last episode airing January 8, 2021, after over 36 years in the role. Following his death, a variety of guest hosts completed the season[3] beginning with consulting producer and former contestant Ken Jennings, each hosting for a few weeks before passing the role onto someone else. Then-executive producerMike Richards initially assumed the position of permanent host in September 2021, but relinquished the role within a week.[4] Since then, Jennings and Mayim Bialik have served as permanent rotating hosts of the syndicated series. While Bialik was originally arranged to host additional primetimespecials on ABC, and spin-offs, the announcement of Jeopardy! Masters in 2023 meant these duties were shared as well. Following Bialik's withdrawal in part of supporting writers and actors due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, Jennings assumed hosting duties for all forms of media.\nCurrently in its 40th season, Jeopardy! is one of the longest-running game shows of all time. The show has consistently enjoyed a wide viewership and received many accolades from professional television critics. With over 8,000 episodes aired,[2] the daily syndicated version of Jeopardy! has won a record 39 Daytime Emmy Awards as well as a Peabody Award. In 2013, the program was ranked No. 45 on TV Guide's list of the 60 greatest shows in American television history. Jeopardy! has also gained a worldwide following with regional adaptations in many other countries.\nEach game of Jeopardy! features three contestants competing in three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy![5] In each round, contestants are presented trivia clues phrased as answers, to which they must respond in the form of a question that correctly identifies whatever the clue is describing.[5] For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response is \"Who is/was George Washington?\"\nThe layout of the Jeopardy! game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round (in the second round, the values are doubled). Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature large electronic game boards consisting of six categories with five clues each. The clues are valued by dollar amounts from lowest to highest, ostensibly by difficulty.[5] The values of the clues increased over time, with those in the Double Jeopardy! round always being double the range of the Jeopardy! round.[5] On the original Jeopardy! series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50 in the Jeopardy! round and $20 to $100 in Double Jeopardy![6] On The All-New Jeopardy!, they ranged from $25 to $125 and $50 to $250. The 1984 series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500 in Jeopardy! and $200 to $1,000 in Double Jeopardy![5] These ranges were increased to $200\u2013$1,000 and $400\u2013$2,000, respectively, on November 26, 2001.[7]\nGameplay begins when the returning champion (or in Tournament of Champions play, the highest seeded player, or in all tournaments' second or final round play, the player with the highest score in the previous round) selects a clue by indicating its category and dollar value on the game board. The two (or if there is no returning champion, three) challengers, or in non-Tournament of Champions play, first round tournament contestants, participate in a random draw prior to taping to determine contestant order, and if there is no returning champion or in first round play of regular tournaments, the contestant who drew the first lectern starts first. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring in using a lock-out device. The first contestant to ring in successfully is prompted to respond to the clue by stating a question containing the correct answer to the clue. Any grammatically coherent question with the correct answer within it counts as a correct response.[8] If the contestant responds correctly, its dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response or a failure to respond within five seconds deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged too vague to be correct, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.[5] Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response, and the player who selected the previous clue chooses the next clue.[9] Gameplay continues until the board is cleared or the round's time length expires, which is typically indicated by a beeping sound. The contestant who has the lowest score selects the first clue to start the Double Jeopardy! round.[9] If there is a tie for the contestant with the lowest score, the contestant with the last correct question among the tied players will select first in the round, a rule change since season 38 (2021) and made public on an August 2022 show podcast.[10]\nA \"Daily Double\" clue is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy![5] The name and inspiration were taken from a horse-racing term.[11] Daily Double clues with a sound component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\", and clues with a video component are known as \"Video Daily Doubles\". Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who has selected the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of their entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.[9][12] Only the contestant who chooses the Daily Double is allowed to answer the clue and they must provide a response. A correct response adds the value of the wager to the contestant's score while an incorrect response (or failure to provide any response at all) deducts the same value. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, they choose the next clue.[9]\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind them to watch their phrasing in future responses if they do. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response only able to be ruled as correct if it is phrased properly in question form. A contestant who initially does not phrase a response in the form of a question must re-phrase it before the host rules against them.[12]\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the clues are sometimes written in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Deviating from this is known as the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents that was first used in 1985 by Chuck Forrest, who won over $70,000 in his initial run as champion. Trebek expressed that this strategy not only annoyed him but the staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.[13] Another strategy used by some contestants is to play all of the higher-valued clues first and build up a substantial lead, starting at the bottom of the board. James Holzhauer, whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day game totals, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.[14]\nFrom the premiere of the original Jeopardy! until the end of the 1984\u201385 syndicated season, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants have been required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal.[15] Attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.[16] The change was made to allow the home audience to play along more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a sound accompanied a contestant ringing in. According to Trebek, the sound was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.[15] Contestants who are visually impaired or blind have been given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins.[17][18]\nTo ensure fairness in competition and accuracy in scores, the judges double-check their own rulings throughout the production of each episode. If it is determined at any point that a previous response was wrongly ruled correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity, typically either at the start of the next round/segment or immediately after a Daily Double is found, with the host providing any necessary explanation regarding the changes. If an error that may have affected the result is not discovered until after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.[19] However, this is rare, as most errors are found in the course of an episode's taping itself.\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded a consolation prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.[20] This rule is still in place for the syndicated version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and they may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.[21]\nThe Final Jeopardy! round features a single clue. At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category and a commercial break follows. Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with less than $1 do not participate in this round. During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate.[22] Contestants write their wagers using a light pen on an electronic display on their lectern, and are limited to five minutes (although the limit may be adjusted if production issues delay the resumption of taping). During this time, contestants also phrase the question, which is pre-written during the wager.[23] After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's \"Think!\" music plays. If either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can manually write their responses and wagers using an index card and marker, although the index card has the required phrasing pre-printed on each side (\"Who/What\"). Visually impaired or blind contestants typically type their responses and wagers with a computer keyboard.[17][18]\nContestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Once a correct response is revealed the host confirms it. Otherwise, the host reveals the correct response if all contestants responded incorrectly. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to their score. A miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response, misspelling that affects the pronunciation of the answer, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.[9]\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third receives the third-place prize.\nVarious researchers have studied Final Jeopardy! wagering strategies. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score (a situation known as a \"runaway game\"), the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.[24]: 269 Otherwise, according to Jeopardy! College Champion Keith Williams, the leader usually wagers an amount that would be a dollar greater than twice the second place contestant's score, guaranteeing a win with a correct response.[25] Writing about Jeopardy! wagering in the 1990s, mathematicians George Gilbert and Rhonda Hatcher said that \"most players wager aggressively.\"[24]: 269\nThe top scorer in each game is paid their winnings in cash and returns to play in the next match. Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been awarded in cash -- $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.[26] Since travel and lodging are generally not provided for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. Production covers the cost of travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. Production also covers the cost of travel if a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week.[27] Starting in Season 40, according to the official podcast in August 2023, as a result of inflation, consolation prizes were raised $1,000 each to $3,000 for second and $2,000 for third.\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash where applicable. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who stopped participating in the game, or avoided wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. This also allowed the increase to clue values since only one contestant's score is paid instead of three.[28] From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants.[29]\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions. The five-day limit was eliminated September 8, 2003.[30]\nIn rare instances, contestants tie for first place. The rules related to ties have changed over time. Since November 24, 2014,[31] ties for first place following Final Jeopardy! are broken with a tie-breaker clue, resulting in only one champion being named, keeping their winnings, and returning to compete in the next show. The tied contestants are given the single clue, and the first contestant to buzz-in must give the correct question. A contestant cannot win by default if the opponent gives an incorrect question or forgets to phrase the response as a question (even if correct). The contestant must give a correct question to win the game. If neither player gives the correct question, another clue is given.[32] Previously, if two or all three contestants tied for first place, they were declared \"co-champions\", and each retained his or her winnings and (unless one was a five-time champion who retired prior to 2003) returned on the following episode. A tie occurred on the January 29, 2014, episode when Arthur Chu, leading at the end of Double Jeopardy!, wagered to tie challenger Carolyn Collins rather than winning. Chu followed Jeopardy! College Champion Keith Williams's advice to wager for the tie to increase the leader's chances of winning.[33][34] A three-way tie for first place has only occurred once on the syndicated version hosted by Trebek, on March 16, 2007, when Scott Weiss, Jamey Kirby, and Anders Martinson all ended the game with $16,000.[35] Until March 1, 2018,[31][36] no regular game had ended in a tie-breaker.\nIf no contestant finishes Final Jeopardy! with a positive total, there is no winner and three new contestants compete on the next episode. This has happened on several episodes, including the second episode hosted by Trebek.[37][38][39]\nA winner unable to return as champion because of a change in personal circumstances \u2013 for example, illness or a job offer \u2013 may be allowed to appear as a co-champion (now a rare occurrence since the co-champion rule was disestablished in early Season 31) in a later episode.[40][41][42]\nStarting with season 39, Johnny Gilbert announces the names of the next two contestants on the following episode at the end of each episode.\nThroughout each season, Jeopardy! features various special tournaments for particular groups, including among others college students, teenagers, and teachers. Each year at the Tournament of Champions, the players who had won the most games and money in the previous season come back to compete against each other for a large cash prize. Tournaments generally feature 15 contestants and run for 10 consecutive episodes. They generally take place across three rounds: the quarterfinal round (five games), the semifinal round (three games), and the final round (two games).\nThe first five episodes, the quarterfinals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarterfinals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarterfinal games. Since the removal of the five-game limit in regular gameplay, in the unlikely case of a tie in total winnings between two Tournament of Champions players, the player who won the most games receives the higher seed. If still tied, seeding is determined by comparing the tied players' aggregate Double Jeopardy! and (if still tied) Jeopardy! round scores.\nThe winners of the five quarterfinal games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\") advance to the semifinals, which run for three days. The semifinals are seeded with the quarterfinal winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarterfinal scores, and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarterfinal games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semifinals. The winners of the three semifinal games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.[43]\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".[44]\nIf none of the contestants in a quarterfinal end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.[45] This occurred in the quarterfinals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semifinals of the 2013 Teen Tournament, where the rule was in effect during the semifinals, but after that tournament the rule has changed for semifinals and finals.[45]\nAs the players are not isolated during the semifinals the way they are during the quarterfinals, show officials discovered a flaw after the 2013 Teen Tournament, because the triple zero loss happened in the second semifinal that allowed the third semifinal of the 2013 Teen Tournament to be played differently than the first (which was played before the triple zero loss). Starting with the 2013 Tournament of Champions, semifinal games, like the two-game finals, must have a winner. Players who participate in Final Jeopardy! will participate in the standard tie-breaker, regardless of the score being zero or a positive score. Similarly, if all three players have a zero score at the end of a two-game match, a normal tournament finals format will proceed to a tie-breaker. In a tournament format where a player must win multiple games to win the tournament, such as the 2020 Greatest of All Time or 2022 Tournament of Champions, the tie-breaker will be used regardless of the score being zero or positive for players to win the game and receive the point.\nIn the standard tournament finals format, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\nIn a 1963 Associated Press profile released shortly before the original Jeopardy! series premiered, Merv Griffin offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\nMy wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York City from Duluth. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the quiz show scandals. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"\u2014and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was Fibber and Mollie McGee's address. I loved the idea, went straight to NBC with the idea, and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show.[46][47]\nGriffin's first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each, but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera, he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each, with five clues in each of six categories.[48] He originally intended requiring grammatically correct phrasing (e.g., only accepting \"Who is...\" for a person), but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down, he decided to accept any correct response that was in question form.[49] Griffin discarded his initial title of What's the Question? when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game, claiming, \"It doesn't have enough jeopardies.\"[48][50]\nThe format of giving contestants the answers and requiring the questions had previously been used by the Gil Fates-hosted program CBS Television Quiz, which aired from July 1941 until May 1942.[51]\nKen Jennings has shared hosting duties on the syndicated version since 2021, while also hosting the prime-time Jeopardy! Masters and second Celebrity Jeopardy! tournaments.\nArt Fleming was the original host of the show throughout both NBC runs and its brief weekly syndicated run, between 1964 and 1979. Alex Trebek served as host of the daily syndicated version from its premiere in 1984 until his death in 2020,[52] except when he switched places with Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak as an April Fool's joke on April 1, 1997.[53]\nOn a Fox News program in July 2018, Trebek said the odds of his retirement in 2020 were 50/50 \"and a little less\". He added that he might continue if he's \"not making too many mistakes\" but would make an \"intelligent decision\" as to when he should give up the emcee role.[54] In November 2018, Trebek renewed his contract as host through 2022,[55] stating in January 2019 that the work schedule consisting of 46 taping sessions each year was still manageable for a man of his age.[56] On March 6, 2019, Trebek announced he had been diagnosed with stage IVpancreatic cancer (a disease from which Fleming also died on April 25, 1995). In a prepared video statement announcing his diagnosis, Trebek noted that his prognosis was poor but that he would aggressively fight the cancer in hopes of beating the odds and would continue hosting Jeopardy! for as long as he was able, joking that his contract obligated him to do so for three more years regardless of health.[57]\nTrebek was still serving as host, having taped his last episode on October 29, 2020, for an intended Christmas Day broadcast, when contingency plans were made for him to miss the next taping, scheduled for November 9\u201310, 2020. In an October 13, 2022, interview for New York magazine's Vulture section, Ken Jennings noted supervising producers Lisa Broffman and Rocky Schmidt had named him interim host for that taping and remembered his last conversation with Trebek days before rehearsal was to commence.\nI was scheduled to come into the studio to rehearse for some games; even if Alex bounced back as he had before, he wanted somebody to fill in for him for a little while. A producer set up a call, and his voice was notably weaker than we\u2019d ever heard it on the air, which really struck me at first. It was a tough moment. But once you got over the timbre of the voice, he was still very much Alex \u2014 going down conversational side paths about old movies he liked. At one point, he started talking about tennis players he compared to various Jeopardy! champions. But the thing that stuck with me is he thanked me for coming in to fill in for him. That just broke me. I said, \u201cAlex, are you kidding? We should be thanking you. I\u2019d take a bullet for you, Alex. I\u2019m happy to help.\u201d\n\u2014 Ken Jennings, on the phone call by producers between him and Alex Trebek on November 6, 2020.\nIn an August 2, 2023, podcast by Sony Pictures Television and Sony Music, This is Jeopardy!: The Story of America's Favorite Quiz Show, supervising producer Lisa Broffman noted the rehearsal for Jennings was scheduled November 8, 2020, but cancelled when Rocky Schmidt gave staff the news Alex Trebek had died that day.\nWe had planned on having Ken (Jennings) come in to rehearse on November 8th, 2020. So we had a crew in, and that morning, (supervising producer) Rocky Schmidt called me and said, \"He's gone.\" So we canceled the rehearsal day.\nAt the time of Trebek's death, producers publicly declined to discuss any plans to introduce his successor while stating that they had enough new episodes with Trebek as host to run through Christmas Day, even though the show's official podcast in 2023 admitted Ken Jennings was officially scheduled as interim host, with his first taping cancelled on the news of Trebek's death.[60]\nOn November 9, 2020, the first episode to air after Trebek's death, executive producer Mike Richards paid tribute to Trebek, after a few seconds of silence where the lights on the Jeopardy! set (which had been set up for Jennings to host before Trebek's death) slowly dimmed.[61] That episode, as well as subsequent episodes that aired after Trebek's death, also included a dedication screen at the end of the credits through the remainder of the season.[62]\nTo compensate for concerns over pre-emptions caused by holiday week specials and sports, Sony announced on November 23, 2020, that the air dates of Trebek's final week were postponed, with episodes scheduled for the week of December 21\u201325 being postponed to January 4\u20138, 2021. Reruns of episodes in which Trebek recorded clues on location aired from December 21, 2020, to January 1, 2021, before his final episodes aired January 4\u20138, 2021.[63]\nOn August 11, 2021, it was announced that Richards would succeed Trebek as host of the daily show and Bialik would host Jeopardy! primetime specials and spin-offs.[69][70] On August 20, 2021, following a report from The Ringer exposing controversial remarks made on his podcast in the past, resurfaced controversies from Richards's time on The Price Is Right, and accusations of self-dealing regarding his executive producer position, Richards stepped down as host after taping the first week of episodes while remaining executive producer, before being dismissed from the latter role on August 31. Richards's five episodes as host aired in September 2021.[71][72] Bialik and Jennings then alternated hosting the show for the rest of season 38, through the end of July 2022. Bialik also hosted the season's various tournaments and primetime specials.[73]\nIn July 2022, it was announced that Bialik and Jennings would continue splitting hosting duties for the 39th season of the syndicated version. Jennings would also host the Tournament of Champions and the new Second Chance Tournament, while Bialik would also again host primetime specials and spinoffs, including a new celebrity edition of Jeopardy!, which premiered in September 2022.[74][75] However, in January 2023, ABC announced Jennings would host a Jeopardy! Masters spinoff, indicating a change of arrangement.[76] In May 2023, Bialik opted not to host the final episodes of the season in support of writers during the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, with Jennings stepping in to host the remaining episodes.[77] Bialik formally went on strike with her union, SAG-AFTRA, shortly thereafter, precluding her from hosting the program during the course of the strike.[78] It was later announced that Jennings would host the second season of the new celebrity edition.[79]\nDon Pardo held the role of announcer on the NBC version and weekly syndicated version,[6] while John Harlan replaced him for The All-New Jeopardy![80] In the daily syndicated version's first pilot, from 1983, Jay Stewart served as the announcer, but Johnny Gilbert took over the role at Trebek's recommendation when that version was picked up as a series.[81]\nThe Jeopardy! Clue Crew, introduced on September 24, 2001, was a team of roving correspondents who appeared in videos, recorded around the world, to narrate some clues.[82] Explaining why the Clue Crew was added, executive producer Harry Friedman said, \"TV is a visual medium, and the more visual we can make our clues, the more we think it will enhance the experience for the viewer.\"[83]\nFollowing the initial announcement of auditions for the team, over 5,000 people applied for Clue Crew posts.[83] The original Clue Crew members were Cheryl Farrell, Jimmy McGuire, Sofia Lidskog, and Sarah Whitcomb Foss.[82] Jon Cannon and Kelly Miyahara joined the Clue Crew in 2005.[84] Farrell recorded clues until October 2008,[85] and Cannon until July 2009.[86] Miyahara, who also served as announcer for the Sports Jeopardy! spin-off series, left in 2019.[87][88]\nThe Clue Crew was eliminated beginning with the 39th season in September 2022; Foss became a producer for the show and McGuire a stage manager.[87] Foss also serves as in-studio announcer when Johnny Gilbert is unable to attend a taping. In such cases, her voice is replaced with Gilbert's in post-production.[52][89]\nThe Clue Crew traveled to over 300 cities worldwide, spanning all 50 of the United States and 46 other countries. Occasionally, they visited schools to showcase the educational game Classroom Jeopardy![90]\nRobert Rubin served as the producer of the original Jeopardy! series for most of its run and later became its executive producer.[91] Following Rubin's promotion, the line producer was Lynette Williams.[91]\nGriffin was the daily syndicated version's executive producer until his retirement in 2000.[92] Trebek served as producer as well as host until 1987, when he began hosting NBC's Classic Concentration for the next four years.[92] At that time, he handed producer duties to George Vosburgh, who had formerly produced The All-New Jeopardy! In 1997, Harry Friedman, Lisa Finneran, and Rocky Schmidt succeeded Vosburgh as producers of the show. Beginning in 1999, Friedman became executive producer,[93] and Gary Johnson became the third producer. In 2006, Deb Dittmann and Brett Schneider became producers, while Finneran, Schmidt, and Johnson became supervising producers.[91]\nThe original Jeopardy! series was directed at different times by Bob Hultgren, Eleanor Tarshis, and Jeff Goldstein.[91] Dick Schneider, who directed episodes of The All-New Jeopardy!, returned as director from 1984 to 1992. From 1992 to 2018, Kevin McCarthy served as director, who had previously served as associate director under Schneider.[92] McCarthy announced his retirement after 26 years on June 26, 2018, and was succeeded as director by Clay Jacobsen.[94]\nAs of 2012, Jeopardy! employs nine writers and five researchers to create and assemble the categories and clues.[95] Billy Wisse is the editorial producer and Michele Loud is the editorial supervisor[96] Previous writing and editorial supervisors have included Jules Minton, Terrence McDonnell, Harry Eisenberg, and Gary Johnson.[91] Trebek himself also contributed to writing clues and categories.[97]\nOn August 1, 2019, Sony Pictures Television announced that Friedman would retire as executive producer of both Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune at the end of the 2019\u201320 season.[100] On August 29, 2019, it was announced that Mike Richards replaced Friedman in 2020.[101] On August 31, 2021, after Richards had resigned as permanent host earlier in the month, he was fired from his executive producer position at both Jeopardy! and Wheel, with Sony executives citing continued internal turmoil that Richards's resignation as host had failed to quell as they had hoped. Michael Davies from Embassy Row, which also produces Sony game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, was selected as interim executive producer[102] through the 2021\u201322 season.[73] On April 14, 2022, Davies accepted the role on a permanent basis.[103]\nFive episodes are taped each day, with two days of taping every other week.[110] However, taping slowed after Alex Trebek's health issues in 2019 until his last taping day on October 29, 2020. Some weeks had three episodes taped within a single day, while some had two episodes taped within a single day.[111]\nVarious sets used by the syndicated version over the years. From top to bottom: 1984\u201385, 1985\u201391, 1991\u201396, 1996\u20132002, 2002\u201306, and 2009\u201313.\nVarious technological and aesthetic changes have been made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them.[6]The All-New Jeopardy!'s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured pull cards with the dollar amount in front and the clue behind it. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991.[112] In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall,[113] which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.[114]\nFrom 1985 to 1997, the sets were designed to have a background color of blue for the Jeopardy! round and red for the Double Jeopardy! and Final Jeopardy! rounds. In 1991 a brand new set was introduced that resembled a grid.[112] On the episode aired November 11, 1996, Jeopardy! introduced the first of several sets designed by Naomi Slodki, who intended the set to resemble \"the foyer of a very contemporary library, with wood and sandblasted glass and blue granite\".[115]\nIn 2002, another new set was introduced,[116] which was given slight modifications when Jeopardy! and sister show Wheel of Fortune transitioned to high-definition broadcasting in 2006.[113] During this time, virtual tours of the set began to be featured on the official web site.[117] The various HD improvements for Jeopardy! and Wheel represented a combined investment of approximately $4 million, 5,000 hours of labor, and 6 miles (9.7 km) of cable.[113] Both programs had been shot using HD cameras for several years before beginning to broadcast in HD. On standard-definition television broadcasts, episodes continue displaying with an aspect ratio of 4:3.\nIn 2013, Jeopardy! introduced another new set.[118] This set underwent several modifications in 2020, with a wider studio without any studio audience (the last episodes of the 2019\u20132020 season were also taped without an audience), and new lecterns for contestants and the host. The lecterns are spaced considerably apart to comply with California state regulations imposed when filming resumed after the coronavirus pandemic ended the 2020 season early.[119] Although the modified COVID-era set from the previous two seasons was kept, the live studio audience fully returned for season 39, which began airing on September 12, 2022.[120]\nSince the debut of Jeopardy! in 1964, several songs and arrangements have been used as the theme music, most of which were composed by Griffin. The main theme for the original Jeopardy! series was \"Take Ten\",[121] composed by Griffin's wife Julann.[122]The All-New Jeopardy! opened with \"January, February, March\" and closed with \"Frisco Disco\", both of which were composed by Griffin himself.[123]\nThe best-known theme song on Jeopardy! is \"Think!\", originally composed by Griffin under the title \"A Time for Tony\", as a lullaby for his son.[124] \"Think!\" has always been used for the 30-second period in Final Jeopardy! when the contestants write down their responses, and since the syndicated version debuted in 1984, a rendition of that tune has been used as the main theme song.[125] \"Think!\" has become so popular that it has been used in many different contexts, from sporting events to weddings;[126] \"its 30-second countdown has become synonymous with any deadline pressure\".[127] Griffin estimated that the use of \"Think!\" had earned him royalties of over $70 million throughout his lifetime.[128] \"Think!\" led Griffin to win the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) President's Award in 2003,[129] and during GSN's 2009 Game Show Awards special, it was named \"Best Game Show Theme Song\".[130] In 1997, the main theme (later rearranged in 2001) and Final Jeopardy! \"Think!\" cue were rearranged by Steve Kaplan, who served as music director until his December 2003 death.[131] Then in 2008, the Jeopardy! music package was rearranged again, this time by Chris Bell Music & Sound Design.[132] The fully-synthesized 2021 version of the main theme, which is based on the 2008 arrangement, was composed by Bleeding Fingers Music and has been used since season 38.[133]\nFor the original Jeopardy! series, prospective contestants contacted the production office in New York to arrange an appointment and to preliminarily determine eligibility. They were briefed and auditioned together in groups of ten to thirty individuals, participating in both a written test and mock games. Individuals who were successful at the audition were invited to appear on the program within approximately six weeks.[134]\nSince 1984, prospective contestants begin with a written exam comprising 50 questions.[135] This exam is administered online periodically, as well as being offered at regional contestant search events. Since 1998, a Winnebago recreational vehicle dubbed the \"Jeopardy! Brain Bus\" travels to conduct regional events throughout the United States and Canada.[136] Participants who correctly answer at least 35 out of 50 questions advance in the audition process and are invited to attend in-person group auditions throughout the country. At these auditions, a second written exam is administered, followed by a mock game and interviews. Those who are approved are notified at a later time and invited to appear as contestants.[137]\nContestants are required to travel to the production location, which since 1994, has been Culver City, California, making travel and lodging arrangements at their own expense when doing so. This requirement has been criticized by contestant Ben Goldstein, who stated in June 2023, in reference to The Jeopardy! Fan website, 'that the show would be more accessible to a wider range of contestants if the production paid for these expenses, saying, \"Not everyone can afford a trip to L.A. with no guarantee of payback.\" The website's creator Andy Saunders, replied, \"This has been a longstanding Jeopardy! policy and has generally been presented as an issue of fairness by the show. A 1994 Oakland Tribune article quotes then\u2013contestant coordinator Kelley Carpenter as saying, 'Because we have both out-of-towners and locals appearing on the show, if we were to pay for an airfare and a hotel, we would have technically given away money to some contestants coming from the East Coast, which wouldn't be fair to someone who only lives 20 minutes away.'\"[138] Eligibility is limited to people who have not previously appeared as contestants, and have not been to an in-person audition for at least 18 months.[137]\nMany of the contestants who appear on the series, including a majority of Teen Tournament contestants and nearly half of all College Tournament contestants, participated in quiz bowl competitions during their time in high school. The National Academic Quiz Tournaments has been described by Ken Jennings as a de facto \"minor league\" for game shows such as Jeopardy![139]\nThe original Jeopardy! series premiered on NBC on March 30, 1964,[108] and by the end of the 1960s was the second-highest-rated daytime game show, behind only The Hollywood Squares.[140] The program was successful until 1974, when Lin Bolen, then NBC's Vice President of Daytime Programming, moved the show out of the noontime slot where it had been located for most of its run, as part of her effort to boost ratings among the 18\u201334 female demographic.[141] After 2,753 episodes, the original Jeopardy! series ended on January 3, 1975. To compensate Griffin for its cancellation, NBC purchased Wheel of Fortune, another show that he had created, and premiered it the following Monday.[142] A syndicated edition of Jeopardy!, distributed by Metromedia and featuring many contestants who were previously champions on the original series, aired in primetime from 1974 to 1975.[143] The NBC daytime series was later revived as The All-New Jeopardy!, which premiered on October 2, 1978,[144] and aired 108 episodes, ending on March 2, 1979.[145] This revival featured significant rule changes, including progressive elimination of contestants over the course of the main game, and a Super Jeopardy! bonus round (based loosely on bingo) instead of Final Jeopardy![5]\nThe daily syndicated version debuted on September 10, 1984,[146] and was launched in response to the success of the syndicated version of Wheel[147] and the installation of electronic trivia games in pubs and bars.[148] This version of the program has outlived 300 other game shows and has become the second most popular game show in syndication (behind Wheel), averaging 25 million viewers per week. The most recent renewal, in January 2023, extends it through the 2027\u201328 season.[149]\nCountries with versions of Jeopardy! listed in yellow (and the common Arabic-language version in bright yellow)\nJeopardy! has spawned versions in many foreign countries throughout the world, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Israel, and Australia.[150] The American syndicated version of Jeopardy! is also broadcast throughout the world, with international distribution rights handled by CBS Studios International.[151]\nThree spin-off versions of Jeopardy! have been created. Rock & Roll Jeopardy! debuted on VH1 in 1998[152] and ran until 2001. The format centered around post-1950s popular music trivia and was hosted by Jeff Probst.[5]Jep!, which aired on GSN during the 1998\u20131999 season, was a special children's version hosted by Bob Bergen and featured various rule changes from the original version.[153]Sports Jeopardy!, a sports-themed version hosted by Dan Patrick, premiered in 2014 on the Crackle digital service and eventually moved to the cable sports network NBCSN in 2016.[154]\nIn March 2020, taping halted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally, the production team taped episodes without an audience, until production was shut down altogether. In May 2020, Sony announced new episodes would air until June 12, 2020, including the Teacher's Tournament.[155][156] In July 2020, Jeopardy! began rerunning a package of 20 classic episodes, including the first two from the syndicated run.[157]\nProduction resumed in August 2020 with new safety measures in place following government guidelines to protect contestants, staff, crew and talent. New expanded lecterns, designed to allow social distancing during gameplay, are spaced apart from one another.[158] In seasons 37\u201338, only essential staff and crew were allowed on stage. Personal protective equipment is provided for everyone behind the scenes and all staff and crew are tested regularly, while contestants are also tested before they step onto the set. Social distancing measures are also enforced off-stage.[159]Ken Jennings joined production in an on-air role in 2020.[160]\nFollowing Trebek's death, an announcement noted that the pre-taped episodes were to air posthumously until December 25, 2020.[161][162] Owing to concerns after a late start to tapings caused by the pandemic and the cancellation of November tapings, officials added a two-week lineup of classic episodes to avoid NFL, NBA, or local Christmas programming preemptions that moved Trebek's final episode to January 8, 2021. The first episode with an interim host aired January 11, 2021.\nOnly a small number of episodes of the first three Jeopardy! versions survive. From the original NBC daytime version, archived episodes mostly consist of black-and-white kinescopes of the original color videotapes.[163] Various episodes from 1967, 1971, 1973, and 1974 are listed among the holdings of the UCLA Film and Television Archive.[164] The 1964 \"test episode\", Episode No. 2,000 (from February 21, 1972, in color), and a June 1975 episode of the weekly syndicated edition exist at the Paley Center for Media.[165] The test episode, of which only a few limited clips had been released, was released to the public in full on the Jeopardy!YouTube account March 30, 2022, and an audiotape containing approximately five minutes (including introductions and Final Jeopardy!) from the first aired episode was also released to the public; both episodes were released to celebrate the 58th anniversary of the show's debut.[166][167] The 1975 series finale, also in color and containing two short clips from the 1967 \"College Scholarship Tournament\" and Gene Shalit's appearance on an early version of Celebrity Jeopardy! also exists in its entirety. Incomplete paper records of the NBC-era games exist on microfilm at the Library of Congress. GSN holds The All-New Jeopardy!'s premiere and finale in broadcast quality, and aired the latter on December 31, 1999, as part of its \"Y2Play\" marathon.[145] The UCLA Archive holds a copy of a pilot taped for CBS in 1977,[164] and the premiere exists among the Paley Center's holdings.[165]\nGSN, which, like Jeopardy!, is an affiliate of Sony Pictures Television, has rerun episodes since the channel's launch in 1994. Copies of 43 Trebek-hosted syndicated Jeopardy! episodes aired between 1989 and 2004 have been collected by the UCLA Archive,[164] and the premiere and various other episodes are included in the Paley Center's collection.[165] In July 2022, Vulture reported that vintage episodes of the daily syndicated version would air on a dedicated channel on Pluto TV (owned by distributor Paramount Global) beginning in August.[168] The channel, named Jeopardy! Hosted by Alex Trebek, launched on August 1.[169]\nBy 1994, the press called Jeopardy! \"an American icon\".[170] It has won a record 39 Daytime Emmy Awards.[171] The program holds the record for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show, with seventeen awards won in that category.[95] Trebek won seven awards for Outstanding Game Show Host.[95] Twelve other awards were won by the show's directors and writers in the categories of Outstanding Direction for a Game/Audience Participation Show and Outstanding Special Class Writing before these categories were removed in 2006. On June 17, 2011, Trebek shared the Lifetime Achievement Award with Sajak at the 38th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony.[172] The following year, the program was honored with a Peabody Award for its role in encouraging, celebrating, and rewarding knowledge.[173]\nIn its April 17\u201323, 1993, issue, TV Guide named Jeopardy! the best game show of the 1970s as part of a celebration of the magazine's 40th anniversary.[174] In January 2001, the magazine ranked the program number 2 on its \"50 Greatest Game Shows\" list\u2014second only to The Price Is Right.[175] It later ranked Jeopardy! number 45 on its list of the 60 Best TV Series of All Time, calling it \"habit-forming\" and saying that the program \"always makes [its viewers] feel smarter\".[176] Also in 2013, the program ranked number 1 on TV Guide's list of the 60 Greatest Game Shows.[177] In the summer of 2006, the program was ranked number 2 on GSN's list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, second only to Match Game.[178]\nA hall of fame honoring Jeopardy! was added to the Sony Pictures Studios tour on September 20, 2011. It features the show's Emmy Awards as well as retired set pieces, classic merchandise, video clips, photographs, and other memorabilia related to Jeopardy!'s history.[179]\nIn 1989, Fleming expressed dissatisfaction with the daily syndicated Jeopardy! series in an essay published in Sports Illustrated. He confessed that he only watched the Trebek version infrequently\u2014only for a handful of questions\u2014and criticized this iteration mainly for its Hollywood setting. Fleming believed that in contrast to New Yorkers who Fleming considered being more intelligent and authentic, moving the show to Hollywood brought both an unrealistic glamour and a dumbing-down of the program that he disdained. He also disliked the decision to not award losing contestants their cash earnings (believing the parting gifts offered instead were cheap) and expressed surprise that what he considered a parlor game had transformed into such a national phenomenon under Trebek.[180] In television interviews, Fleming expressed similar sentiments while also noting that he approved of Trebek's approach to hosting, that Fleming and Trebek were personal friends and that, despite the modern show's flaws, it was still one of the best television shows.[181]\nJeopardy!'s answer-and-question format has become widely entrenched: Fleming observed that other game shows had contestants phrasing their answers in question form, leading hosts to remind them that they are not competing on Jeopardy![182]\nStarting in 1985, the show has held an annual Tournament of Champions featuring the top fifteen champions who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. The top prize awarded to the winner was originally valued at $100,000,[150] and increased to $250,000 in 2003.[183] Other regular tournaments include the Teen Tournament, with a $100,000 top prize;[151] the College Championship, in which undergraduate students from American colleges and universities compete for a $100,000 top prize; and the Teachers Tournament, where educators compete for a $100,000 top prize.[184] Each tournament runs for ten consecutive episodes in a format devised by Trebek himself, consisting of five quarter-final games, three semi-finals, and a final consisting of two games with the scores totaled.[43] Winners of the College Championship and Teachers Tournament are invited to participate in the Tournament of Champions.\nNon-tournament events held regularly on the show include Celebrity Jeopardy!, in which celebrities and other notable individuals compete for charitable organizations of their choice,[185] and Kids Week, a special competition for school-age children aged 10 through 12.[186]\nThree International Tournaments, held in 1996, 1997, and 2001, featured one-week competitions among champions from each of the international versions of Jeopardy! Each of the countries that aired their own version of the show in those years could nominate a contestant. The format was identical to the semi-finals and finals of other Jeopardy! tournaments.[115][150] In 1996 and 1997, the winner received $25,000. In 2001, the top prize was doubled to $50,000. The 1997 tournament was recorded in Stockholm on the set of the Swedish version of Jeopardy!, and is significant for being the first week of Jeopardy! episodes taped in a foreign country.[115]Magnus H\u00e4renstam, the host of the Swedish version of Jeopardy! at the time, introduced the first episode of the 1997 tournament, including Trebek. In addition, prior to Final Jeopardy! each day, a video clip of H\u00e4renstam with Trebek in Stockholm was shown.\nThere have been several special tournaments featuring the greatest contestants in Jeopardy! history. The first of these \"all-time best\" tournaments, Super Jeopardy!, aired in the summer of 1990 on ABC, and featured 35 top contestants from the previous seasons of the Trebek version and one notable champion from the original Jeopardy! series competing for a top prize of $250,000.[143] In 1993, that year's Tournament of Champions was followed by a Tenth Anniversary Tournament conducted over five episodes.[187] In May 2002, to commemorate the Trebek version's 4,000th episode, the show invited fifteen champions to play for a $1 million prize in the Million Dollar Masters tournament, which took place at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.[188] The Ultimate Tournament of Champions aired in 2005 and pitted 145 former Jeopardy! champions against each other, with two winners moving on to face Ken Jennings in a three-game final for $2,000,000, the largest prize in the show's history.[143] Overall, the tournament spanned 15 weeks and 76 episodes, starting on February 9 and ending on May 25.[189] In 2014, Jeopardy! commemorated the 30th anniversary of the Trebek version with a Battle of the Decades tournament, in which 15 champions apiece from the first, second, and third decades of Jeopardy!'s daily syndicated history competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000.[190] On November 18, 2019, an announcement of Jeopardy! returning to ABC for a primetime \"Greatest of All Time\" tournament was made beginning January 7, 2020, which was to include Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and James Holzhauer. The event used a multi-night format, with each episode featuring a two-game match. The contestant with the higher cumulative point total across both games was declared the winner of the match. The first to win three matches received a $1,000,000 prize.[191] The tournament concluded on January 14, 2020, after four matches, with Ken Jennings winning three matches to Holzhauer's one and Rutter's zero wins.[192] Rutter and Holzhauer each received $250,000 for their participation.\nIn November 1998, Jeopardy! traveled to Boston to reassemble 12 past Teen Tournament contestants for a special Teen Reunion Tournament.[136] In 2008, fifteen contestants from the first two Kids Weeks competed in a special reunion tournament.[193] During 2009\u20132010, a special edition of Celebrity Jeopardy!, called the Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational, was played in which twenty-seven contestants from past celebrity episodes competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000 for charity. The grand prize was won by Michael McKean.[194]\nThe IBM Challenge aired February 14\u201316, 2011, and featured IBM's Watson computer facing off against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a two-game match played over three shows.[195] This was the first man-vs.-machine competition in Jeopardy!'s history.[196] Watson won both the first game and the overall match to win the grand prize of $1 million, which IBM divided between two charities (World Vision International and World Community Grid).[197] Jennings, who won $300,000 for second place, and Rutter, who won the $200,000 third-place prize, both pledged to donate half of their winnings to charity.[198] The competition brought the show its highest ratings since the Ultimate Tournament of Champions.[199]\nIn 2019, The All-Star Games had six teams with three former champions each. Each team member played one of the three rounds in each game played. Rutter, David Madden and Larissa Kelly won the tournament.[200]\nThe record holder for lifetime Jeopardy!-related winnings is Brad Rutter, who has won nearly $5.2 million in cash and prizes across five episodes of the regular series (when the rules stipulated that a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated) and seven Jeopardy! tournaments and events (winning five of those specials, along with two third-place finishes).[203] Counting all prizes that he won, he has achieved a cumulative total of $5,129,036 in winnings, which included: the $55,102 prize over five regular episodes in 2000 (also including the value of two cars won, worth $45,000), the $100,000 first-place prize in the 2001 Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions,[204] the $1,000,000 first-place prize in the 2002 Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters Tournament, the $2,000,000 first-place prize (plus $115,000 in preliminary rounds) in the 2005 Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions,[205] the $200,000 third-place prize in the 2011 Jeopardy! IBM Challenge, the $1,030,600 first-place prize in the 2014 Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades, $333,334 (one-third of the $1,000,000 first-place prize, shared with his three-player team) in the 2019 Jeopardy! All-Star Games and a $250,000 prize in the 2020 Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time tournament.\nThe holder of the all-time record for single-day winnings on Jeopardy! is James Holzhauer. Holzhauer first surpassed the record of $77,000, held since 2010[206] by Roger Craig, when he earned $110,914 on the episode that aired on April 9, 2019.[207] Holzhauer pushed his own single-day record to $131,127 on the episode that aired April 17, 2019,[208] by amassing $71,114 over the episode's first two rounds, then successfully wagering an additional $60,013 in the Final Jeopardy! round. Holzhauer's total of 32 consecutive games won was second place of all time in regular game play at the time and remains fourth overall after Matt Amodio and Amy Schneider surpassed Holzhauer in 2021 and 2022, respectively.[209] When he departed the show, he held the top 16 spots for highest single-day regular-game winnings and is the only player to win more than $100,000 in a single episode in regular play (achieved six times).[210] On April 15, 2019, Holzhauer moved into second place for regular play Jeopardy! winnings (behind Jennings) and third place for all Jeopardy!-related winnings (behind Rutter and Jennings). On April 23, 2019, Holzhauer joined Rutter and Jennings as the third Jeopardy!-made millionaire (Amodio eventually became the fourth). The next day, Holzhauer moved onto the top ten list for all-time American game show winnings at No. 10, joining Rutter (#1) and Jennings (#2) on that list. Holzhauer was defeated on the June 3, 2019, episode, finishing in second place.[211] His winnings on Jeopardy! totaled $2,464,216,[212] $58,484 behind Jennings' record.[211] Including over $58,000 from a 2014 appearance on The Chase,[213] with Holzhauer's $2.96 million from Jeopardy! (including his Tournament of Champions and The Greatest of All Time prizes), he is #3 on the list of all-time American game show winnings.\nThe record-holder among women on Jeopardy! for regular series winnings is Amy Schneider,[214] with a total of $1,382,800 earned in 40 episodes between 2021 and 2022.[215][216][209] Schneider is currently ranked second all-time in consecutive games won, behind only Jennings (74).[217][218][209]Mattea Roach, whose winning streak earned $560,983 over 23 games in April and May 2022, has been the most successful Canadian contestant to have competed on the program. Following that 23-game run, Roach ranked fifth for consecutive games won and sixth for regular play Jeopardy! winnings.[219][209]\nThe highest single-day winnings in a Celebrity Jeopardy! tournament was achieved by comedian Andy Richter during a first-round game of the 2009\u20132010 \"Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational\", in which he finished with $68,000 for his selected charity, the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.[220]\nFour contestants on the Trebek version share the record for winning a game with the lowest amount possible, at $1. The first was U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Darryl Scott, on the episode that aired January 19, 1993.[221][222] The second was Benjamin Salisbury, on a Celebrity Jeopardy! episode that aired April 30, 1997.[223] The third was Brandi Chastain, on the Celebrity Jeopardy! episode that aired February 9, 2001.[224] The fourth was U.S. Navy Lieutenant Manny Abell, on the episode that aired October 17, 2017.[222]\nA DVD titled Jeopardy!: An Inside Look at America's Favorite Quiz Show, released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on November 8, 2005, features five curated episodes of the Trebek version (the 1984 premiere, Jennings' final game, and the three-game finals of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions)[243] and three featurettes discussing the show's history and question selection process.[244] Other products featuring the Jeopardy! brand include a collectible watch, a series of daily desktop calendars, and various slot machine games for casinos and the Internet.\nJeopardy!'s official website, active as early as 1998,[245] receives over 400,000 monthly visitors.[246] The website features videos, photographs, and other information related to each week's contestants, as well as mini-sites promoting remote tapings and special tournaments. The Jeopardy! website is regularly updated to align with producers' priorities for the show.[247] In its 2012 \"Readers Choice Awards\", About.com praised the official Jeopardy! website for featuring \"everything [visitors] need to know about the show, as well as some fun interactive elements\", and for having a humorous error page.[248]\nIn November 2009, Jeopardy! launched a viewer loyalty program called the \"Jeopardy! Premier Club\", which allowed home viewers to identify Final Jeopardy! categories from episodes for a chance to earn points, and play a weekly Jeopardy! game featuring categories and clues from the previous week's episodes. Every three months, contestants were selected randomly to advance to one of three quarterly online tournaments; after these tournaments were played, the three highest-scoring contestants would play one final online tournament for the chance to win $5,000 and a trip to Los Angeles to attend a taping of Jeopardy![249] The Premier Club was discontinued by July 2011.[250]\n^Marchese, David (November 12, 2018). \"In Conversation: Alex Trebek\".

He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[7] A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[8] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[4] After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[9] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.[10]\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3\u20131 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse.[11] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] James is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[13] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history.\nOff the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.[14][15]\nJames was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of his birth.[16]: 22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[17][18][19] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[20] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[16]: 23\nJames began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[16]: 24 The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[16]: 27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[22]\nAs a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary varsity basketball team.[23] The Fighting Irish went 27\u20130 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds, along with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26\u20131 and repeated as state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[23]\nIn 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[27] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[16]: 104 With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[23] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[16]: 117 St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary finished the year with a 23\u20134 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[16]: 114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[28][29] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[30]\nThroughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season.[16]: 143 For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,[23] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[16]: 178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[23] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games\u2014the EA SportsRoundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game\u2014losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[31]\nAlso during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[32] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[31] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[31] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[33] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[34] St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[35]\nAs an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary's football team.[16]: 51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[36] At the conclusion of his second year, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] He did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[37] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, former and current players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League.[b]\nJames was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points in a 106\u201392 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003\u20132004 season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35\u201347, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[46]\nIn the 2004\u20132005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[47] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[48] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[49] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[25] Despite a 30\u201320 record to start the year,[49] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42\u201340.[50]\nJames engages in his pre-game ritual of tossing crushed chalk into the air in March 2008; the routine was mostly ended after 2011.[57][58]\nIn the 2006\u20132007 season, James's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[25] Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus.[59] The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[60] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, James logged 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, in a 109\u2013107 double-overtime victory against the Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[64] During the Finals, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[65] as Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.[66]\nIn February of the 2007\u20132008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance.[67] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty.[68] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[69] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45\u201337.[70] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[71] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[72]\nJames and DeShawn Stevenson in April 2008. The two had a short feud after Stevenson called James \"overrated\".[73]\nAt the conclusion of the 2008\u20132009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[74] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[75] He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[76] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66\u201316 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[77] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[78] Reflecting on James's performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[79]\nIn the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the conference finals.[80] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[63] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1\u20131.[81] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[82][83] For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game,[84] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[4]\nIn February of the 2009\u20132010 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[85] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[86] Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[87] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round.[88] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[89] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[90] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and 9 turnovers in the losing effort.[88]\nJames with the Cavaliers in November 2009. He finished his first stint with the Cavaliers averaging 27.8 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.7 steals per game.[91]\nJames became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am EDT on July 1, 2010.[92] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[93] On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[94] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[95] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[96] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[97] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[98] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[99] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[98]\nUpon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James's choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[100] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James's actions.[101] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[102] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as \"the man\".[103][104][105] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[106][107] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which was a radical change from prior years.[108][109] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[110][111] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[109][112][113]\nJames goes in for a slam dunk as a member of the Heat, as John Wall of the Wizards looks on in March 2011.\nJames officially signed with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[114][115] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[116] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[117] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"big three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[118] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[119][120] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[121]\nThroughout the 2010\u201311 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[122] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9\u20138 after 17 games.[123] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[122] On December 2, James faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[124] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball.[125] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[126] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[4]\nIn the Conference semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Celtics for the second consecutive year.[127] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last ten points to help seal a series-clinching win.[128] After the final buzzer, he famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[129] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they were defeated by the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[127] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three.[130] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[131]\nThe 2011\u20132012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[132][123][133] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped him regain a sense of joy on the court.[122] Behind James's expanded skillset,[133] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18\u20136 record.[134] He was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[135]\nJames stands at midcourt during a dead ball on January 16, 2013. On that night, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 20,000 career points.[136]\nIn the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2\u20131.[137] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and 9-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[138] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Celtics.[139][140] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[141] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James's budding rival Kevin Durant.[142] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[143] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James's first championship.[144] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[145] His full postseason run, in which he averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[146]\nIn February of the 2012\u201313 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[147][148] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[149] Based on these accomplishments, James's performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated.[150] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66\u201316 record,[151] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[152] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[4]\nIn Game 1 of the Conference finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[153] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[154] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the Spurs,[155] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[156] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2\u20133.[84][155][157] In Game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[158] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[159] He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[160]\nOn March 3 of the 2013\u201314 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[161] James converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[162] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[4] In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[163] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[164] In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead.[165] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[166] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[167] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[168]\nOn June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[169] On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[170] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[171][172][173] On July 12, he officially signed with the team,[174] who had compiled a league-worst 97\u2013215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[175] A month after James's signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[176]\nJames throws a pass as Gorgui Dieng defends in December 2014. Later that season, James reached several passing milestones, including becoming the Cavaliers' all-time assists leader.[177][178]\nIn January of the 2014\u20132015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[179] In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[4] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2\u20132 series tie with the Bulls.[180] In the conference finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[181] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[181] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2\u20131 lead before being eliminated in six games.[182] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[183] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.[182]\nDuring the 2015\u201316 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[184][185] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[186] James's final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[4] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors,[186] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[187]\nTo begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3\u20131, including two blowout losses.[188] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[189] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[190] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3\u20131 series deficit in the Finals.[11] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[191] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[188] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[192]\nThe 2016\u20132017 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[193] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[194] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[195] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[4] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[196] In Game 5 of the conference finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[197] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the Finals for the third consecutive time against the Warriors, who had signed James's rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[198] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[199]\nJames protects the ball from Kyrie Irving in October 2017. The two were teammates in Cleveland for three seasons.[200]\nPrior to the start of the 2017\u201318 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[200] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[201] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[202] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[203] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[204] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[205] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[4]\nIn the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Warriors.[206] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors.[207] In the first game of the Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland was defeated in overtime.[208] Following the defeat, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[209] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists per game for the Finals.[210]\nOn June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[211] On July 1, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[212] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[213] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[214] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[215]\nThe Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[216][217] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018\u201319 season, they struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[218] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[219] On November 18, he scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Heat.[220] After blowing out the Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20\u201314, but James suffered a groin injury,[221] the first major injury of his career.[222] He missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[221] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[223] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[224] and he was later officially ruled out for the remainder of the season.[225] James's final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[4] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[226]\nDuring the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis.[227] James immediately embraced Los Angeles's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort.[228] Behind James's leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019\u201320 season with a 17\u20132 record, matching the best start in franchise history.[229] On January 25, James passed team legend Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list, the day before Bryant died in a helicopter crash.[230] In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking win against the Clippers.[231] Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game.[232] James earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.[233]\nThe Lakers entered the playoffs as the number one seed in the West and advanced to the Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way.[234] In Game 5 of the conference finals against the Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter.[235] In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2\u20130 lead.[236] In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and 7 assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game.[237] The Lakers finally eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series,[238] his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award.[12] At 35 years and 287 days old, he became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award,[239] and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises.[240] James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.[241]\nThe 2020\u20132021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116\u2013109 loss to the Clippers.[242] On December 31, 2020, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121\u2013107 win against the Spurs.[243] In a 109\u201398 loss to the Nets on February 18, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone;[244] at 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone.[245] On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Hawks,[246] but he was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.[247] By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Jazz, but they went 14\u201316 without Davis and 6\u201310 without James, falling to No. 5.[248] James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.[249]\nIn May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Raptors,[250] but he returned for the final two games,[251][252] and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games;[253] this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history.[254] In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42\u201330 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament.[255] The Lakers won 103\u2013100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with 2 steals and 1 block.[256] His 34-foot (10 m) shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.[257][258]\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Suns. This marked the first time in James's career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series.[259][260] They were up 2\u20131 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.[261] The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career.[259] He finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals.[262] He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection,[2] extending the record for most selections in NBA history,[263] being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.[264]\nFor the 2021\u201322 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook.[265] In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121\u2013116 win. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game,[266] and he was suspended for one game due to his actions.[267] In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double,[268] while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points;[269] during this period, he played 35 percent of his minutes at center.[270][271] From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.[272]\nIn December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and zero turnovers at age 35 or older.[273] In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as he averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old.[274] He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old.[275] By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists.[276][277][278] In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made,[279] and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals.[280][281] In February, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs;[282] by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists.[283][284][285] At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 75 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[286] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[287] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star win,[288] defeating Team Durant 163\u2013161,[289] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[290][291]\nIn March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high,[292][293] becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James's 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason.[294] He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists.[295][296] On March 27, LeBron became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points.[297] Due to an ankle injury in late March, James missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title,[298][299][300] having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify;[301] aged 37, he would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 34.[302]\nFor The Athletic, Bill Oram wrote that James's ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\".[303][304] On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121\u2013110 loss to the Suns.[305] It marked the fourth time in James's career that he missed the playoffs.[306] James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle.[307] He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus\u2013minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52\u201335\u201375 shooting ranges.[308] On May 24, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.[309]\nOn August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.[310][311] The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9 million, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[312] On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in total NBA career three-pointers made.[313] On October 28, James posted 28 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, and 4 steals in an 111\u2013102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

He joined Michael Jordan as the only two players with back-to-back 40-point games at 38 years of age or older.[319] On January 9, James received his 66th player-of-the-week award, doubling the career total of runner-up Bryant.[320] On January 13, he became the second player in NBA history to reach 38,000 points.[321] On January 16, James had a season high 48 points, eight rebounds and nine assists in a 140\u2013132 win over the Houston Rockets. It was his 100th career game with 40 or more points \u2013 including the postseason.[322] On January 23, he scored 46 points, including a career-high nine 3-pointers, in a 133\u2013115 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score at least 40 points in a game against all NBA franchises.[323][324] On January 19, James was named as a starter at the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for the most All-Star selections (19). It was also James's 19th consecutive All-Star appearance, surpassing Bryant's previous mark.[325] On January 31, James put up a triple-double with 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 129\u2013123 overtime win over the New York Knicks, becoming the first player in NBA history to put up a triple-double in his 20th season. He also surpassed Mark Jackson and Steve Nash for fourth on the NBA all-time career assists list.[326][327]\nOn February 7, 2023, in a 133\u2013130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, he scored his 38,388th point to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the record-holder for almost 39 years, to become the all-time leading scorer in NBA history. Abdul-Jabbar had previously set the record on April 5, 1984,[328] 8 months before James was born. After James broke the record, the NBA stopped the game for an on-court ceremony, where he gave a speech and then embraced Abdul-Jabbar, as well as his family.[329][330] James missed the following three games due to left ankle soreness.[331][332] On February 19, Team LeBron lost the 2023 NBA All-Star Game 184\u2013175 to Team Giannis, marking the first time that James lost an All-Star game as a captain. Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5\u20130) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018.[333] During the game, he suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire 2nd half.[334]\nOn February 26, James sustained a right foot injury during a game against the Dallas Mavericks. Despite the injury, James was able to finish the game and helped the Lakers pull off the biggest comeback victory of the season at the time after trailing by 27 points late in the first half. He scored 26 points on 10-for-23 shooting, eight rebounds, and three assists in 37 minutes.[335] However, following an examination by team medical staff on March 2, James was diagnosed with a tendon injury in his right foot and would be reevaluated in three weeks.[336] After missing the previous 13 games, James made his return on March 26 against the Chicago Bulls. He came off the bench for just the second time in his career; the other being in 2007.[337][338] On April 2, James put up a triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 134\u2013109 win over the Houston Rockets. He also tied Jason Kidd for fourth place on the all-time career triple-doubles list.[339] On April 4, James put up 37 points, five rebounds, six assists, one steal, one block, and a game-winning layup in a 135\u2013133 overtime win over the Utah Jazz.[340] On April 9, in the final game of the 2022\u201323 season, James posted 36 points, six rebounds and six assists to lead the Lakers to a 128\u2013117 win over the Utah Jazz, earning the seventh seed in the Western Conference play-in tournament.[341] James finished the regular season with averages of 28.9 points per game, 8.3 rebounds per game, 6.8 assists per game, becoming the oldest player in NBA history to average at least 25 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a season.[342] In Game 4 of the Lakers' first-round series against the Memphis Grizzlies, James had 22 points, a playoff career-high 20 rebounds and 7 assists in a 117\u2013111 overtime win, marking his first 20\u201320 game of his career.[343] He became the first Laker player with a 20\u201320 game in the postseason since Shaquille O'Neal in Game 4 of the 2004 NBA Finals and also the oldest player in league history with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds in a playoff game.[344] In Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, James put up 30 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, two steals, and one block in a 122\u2013101 win over the defending champion Golden State Warriors to lead the Lakers to the 2023 Western Conference finals, their second Conference finals appearance in 5 seasons. He also won his 41st playoff series, surpassing Derek Fisher for the most all-time playoff series wins in NBA history.[345][346] In the Western Conference finals, the Lakers were swept by the eventual NBA championDenver Nuggets, despite James' 40-point, 10-rebound and 9-assist outing in the 113\u2013111 closeout loss in Game 4.[347] He also set his personal playoff record with 31 points in the first half.[348]\nEntering the 2023\u201324 season, James is the oldest player in the league, following the retirements of Udonis Haslem and Andre Iguodala.[6] In the season opener against the defending champion Nuggets, James put up 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists in a 119\u2013107 loss.[349] On November 1, James put up 35 points in a 130\u2013125 overtime win over the Los Angeles Clippers. His 35 points were his 81st 30-point game since turning 35, surpassing Karl Malone for the most 30-point games by any player since turning 35 in NBA history.[350]\nJames made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[351] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[352] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[351] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.[353] James felt his limited playing time was a \"lowlight\" and believed he was not given \"a fair opportunity to play\".[352]\nAt the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[354][355] The team finished the tournament with an 8\u20131 record, winning another bronze medal.[354] James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[356][357]\nBefore naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[356][358] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[359] Team USA went 10\u20130, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[351] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[360] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[361] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.[362]\nJames did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[363] He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[364] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[365] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.[c] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[367] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[351][367] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[368] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: \"[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[369]\nStanding 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[370] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[4] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[371] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[133] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[372][373][374] Through the 2022\u201323 season, James's career averages are 27.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game.[4] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[375][376]\nJames drives to the basket in March 2008. A deft finisher, he led the NBA in scoring and shooting percentage at the rim in 2013.[377]\nAs an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[378] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[379][380] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[381] During his first stint in Cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[133] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[382][383] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[384] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[385] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[386] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[387]\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James's role to a more unconventional one.[133] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[133][388] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[389] Behind these improvements, James's overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[390] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[391] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[392] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[4][393] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[394] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[384]\nFor most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[395] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[396] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses,[397] James creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[398] He executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[399] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[384] Early in James's career, he was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[400][401] however, as his career progressed, James's clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[402]\nAt the beginning of James's NBA career, he was considered a poor defensive player,[403] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, he became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[75] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[404] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[405] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[406] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[407][408] During his second stint in Cleveland, his defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[409] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[410] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[411]\nJames with the Cavaliers in 2017. NBA analyst Brian Windhorst, who spent his career covering James, recounted: \"No one has ever had as much hype as James has had to live up to, and James has delivered on every last drop.\"[412]\nJames left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[d] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[417] As of May 2023, he has been named to 19 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[2] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[418] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[419] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[4] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[74][420] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his ten Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[e] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[422][423][424]\nOn the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[f] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[432] In addition to praising James's on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted James's influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James's move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[433] James's fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... . I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[434]\nJames is also discussed within the context of being the greatest basketball player of all time, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[435] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[436] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[437][438][439] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[438][439] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[439] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[435]\nJames has voiced his desire to play basketball into his forties, potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[440]\nJames married his high school sweetheart Savannah James on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[441] They have three children: two sons\u2014Bronny and Bryce\u2014and daughter Zhuri.[440][442][443] Bronny was named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[444] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[445] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles for about $21 million.[446] James purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[447]\nJames invests heavily in his health, reportedly having spent $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs and athletic trainers, as well as physical therapies of recovery. He has a heavy exercise regimen and dietary habits that some consider atypical for a top athlete. Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal, and Kyle Korver says James's fitness routine is unrivaled.[448] James drinks wine every night, believing that it is good for his heart.[449] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[450] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[451]\nJames's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[452]\nSince 2015, James has been considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture, to be the \"face of the NBA\" alongside two-time MVP Stephen Curry.[453][454] James' opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; in 2014, he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[455] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[456]\nThroughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[459][460] and in 2017, he was listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[461] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[462] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games versus the New York Yankees.[463] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, he was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[464] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[465] In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[466] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[467]\nIn March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele B\u00fcndchen.[471] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding B\u00fcndchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[457][458]\nIn November of that same year, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LeBron James Family Foundation to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[480] James later reflected that it was his most important professional accomplishment of his life. The school officially opened on July 30, 2018.[481]\nThroughout his career, James has taken stances on controversial issues. On several occasions, he mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[482] Those include the War in Darfur,[483][484][485] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[486] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[482] the Michael Brown verdict,[487] and the death of Eric Garner.[488] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[489] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[490] James also called Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[491] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Barack [Obama] though.\"[492][493] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[494][495] James has supported Colin Kaepernick in the aftermath of his participation in the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests, saying that he was being blackballed from a new contract in the National Football League and he would hire him if he owned a football team.[496] He has worn his clothing in a show of support several times.[497][498]\nOn August 27, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Milwaukee Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[514] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[515]\nOn April 21, 2021, in response to the death of Ma'Khia Bryant, James took to Twitter and posted a picture of the police officer who is believed to have fatally shot Bryant, saying: \"YOU'RE NEXT #ACCOUNTABILITY.\" He later deleted the post, explaining: \"I'm so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police. I took the tweet down because its being used to create more hate -This isn't about one officer. it's about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism. I am so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY.\"[516]\nOn November 10, 2021, in response to Kyle Rittenhouse having an emotional break down in court, James tweeted \"What tears????? I didn't see one. Man knock it off! That boy ate some lemon heads before walking into court.\"[517] On December 6, 2021, Rittenhouse said in response that \"I was a Lakers fan too before he said that. I was really pissed off when he said that, because I liked LeBron and then I'm like, you know what fuck you LeBron.\"[518]\nJames and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[561] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James's high school years.[562] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show The Wall,[563] the Disney XD sports documentary show Becoming,[564] the Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[565] and the animated web series The LeBrons.[566] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[567] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[568][569] In February 2018, it was announced that James's production company will produce a new film in the House Party series with James expected to make a cameo.[570] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[571] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, Shut Up and Dribble on Showtime.[572] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[573]\nIn February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album Rap or Go to the League.[574] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[575] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[576]\nIn June 2022, it was announced James is launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter's SpringHill Company. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[577]\nIn 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[578] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[578]\nDuring the 2019 off-season, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[579] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[580]\nJames is represented by agentRich Paul of Klutch Sports.[587] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010.

LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[589][590]\nThroughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[115][591][592] in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[593] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[594] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and the Seattle Seahawks,[595] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[596] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[597] he began opting out,[598] or re-signing,[599][600] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[174] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[601] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[602]\n^Taylor, Phil (June 2, 2009). \"LeBron sent a clear message by not shaking hands with Magic\".

        "context": "\nThe Airbus A380 is a very large wide-body airliner that was developed and produced by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner and only full-length double-deck jet airliner.\nAirbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the \u20ac9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12 December 2006.\nDue to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in 2012 and 2014. However, after the largest customer, Emirates, reduced its last order in February 2019, Airbus announced that A380 production would end in 2021. On 16 December 2021, Emirates received its 123rd A380, which was the 251st and last delivered by Airbus. The A380's estimated $25 billion development cost was not recouped by the time Airbus ended production.\nThe full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating for 525 passengers, with a maximum certified capacity for 853 passengers. The quadjet is powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km; 9,200 mi). As of December 2021[update], the global A380 fleet had completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with no fatalities and no hull losses. As of December 2022[update], there were 237 aircraft in service with 16 operators worldwide.\nIn mid-1988, Airbus engineers led by Jean Roeder began work in secret on the development of an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA), both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its 747.[3]: 7 McDonnell Douglas unsuccessfully offered its double-deck MD-12 concept for sale.[4][5] Lockheed was exploring the possibility for a Very Large Subsonic Transport.[6] Roeder was given approval for further evaluations of the UHCA after a formal presentation to the President and CEO in June 1990.\nThe megaproject was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow, with the stated goal of 15% lower operating costs than the 747-400.[3]: 16\u201317 Airbus organised four teams of designers, one from each of its partners (A\u00e9rospatiale, British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace AG, CASA) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs. The designs were presented in 1992 and the most competitive designs were used.[3]: 17\u201318 In January 1993, Boeing and several companies in the Airbus consortium started a joint feasibility study of a Very Large Commercial Transport (VLCT), aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market.[3]: 31 [7]\nIn June 1994, Airbus announced its plan to develop its own very large airliner, designated as A3XX.[8][9] Airbus considered several designs, including an unusual side-by-side combination of two fuselages from its A340, the largest Airbus jet at the time.[3]: 19 The A3XX was pitted against the VLCT study and Boeing's own New Large Aircraft successor to the 747.[10][11] In July 1995, the joint study with Boeing was abandoned, as Boeing's interest had declined due to analysis that such a product was unlikely to cover the projected $15 billion development cost. Despite the fact that only two airlines had expressed public interest in purchasing such a plane, Airbus was already pursuing its own large-plane project. Analysts suggested that Boeing would instead pursue stretching its 747 design, and that air travel was already moving away from the hub-and-spoke system that consolidated traffic into large planes, and toward more non-stop routes that could be served by smaller planes.[12]\nFrom 1997 to 2000, as the 1997 Asian financial crisis darkened the market outlook, Airbus refined its design, targeting a 15\u201320% reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747-400. The A3XX design converged on a double-decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single-deck design.[13][14] Airbus did so in line with traditional hub-and-spoke theory, as opposed to the point-to-point theory with the Boeing 777,[15] after conducting an extensive market analysis with over 200 focus groups.[16][17] Although early marketing of the huge cross-section touted the possibility of duty-free shops, restaurant-like dining, gyms, casinos and beauty parlours on board, the realities of airline economics have kept such dreams grounded.\nOn 19 December 2000, the supervisory board of newly restructured Airbus voted to launch a \u20ac9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) project to build the A3XX, re-designated as A380, with 50 firm orders from six launch customers.[18][19][20][21] The A380 designation was a break from previous Airbus families, which had progressed sequentially from A300 to A340. It was chosen because the number 8 resembles the double-deck cross section, and is a lucky number in some Asian countries where the aircraft was being marketed.[3] The aircraft configuration was finalised in early 2001, and manufacturing of the first A380 wing-box component started on 23 January 2002. The development cost of the A380 had grown to \u20ac11\u201314[22] billion when the first aircraft was completed.\nIn 2000, the projected development cost was \u20ac9.5 billion.[23] In 2004 Airbus estimated that \u20ac1.5 billion ($2 billion) would need to be added, totalling the developmental costs to \u20ac10.3 billion ($12.7 billion).[24] In 2006, Airbus stopped publishing its reported cost after reaching costs of \u20ac10.2 billion and then it provisioned another \u20ac4.9 billion, after the difficulties in electric cabling and two years delay for an estimated total of \u20ac18 billion.[23]\nIn 2014, the aircraft was estimated to have cost $25bn (\u00a316bn, \u20ac18.9bn) to develop.[25] In 2015, Airbus said development costs were \u20ac15 billion (\u00a311.4 billion, $16.64 billion), though analysts believe the figure is likely to be at least \u20ac5bn ($5.55 Bn) more for a \u20ac20 Bn ($22.19 Bn) total.[26] In 2016, The A380 development costs were estimated at $25 billion for 15 years,[27] $25\u201330 billion,[28] or \u20ac25 billion ($28 billion).[29]\nTo start the programme in 2000, the governments of France, Germany and the UK loaned Airbus 3.5 billion euros and refundable advances reached 5.9 billion euros ($7.3 billion).\nIn February 2018, after an Emirates order secured production of the unprofitable programme for ten years, Airbus revised its deal with the three loan-giving governments to save $1.4 billion (17%): restructured terms, to lower the production rate from eight in 2019 to six per year.[30]\nOn 15 May 2018, in its EU appeal ruling, a WTO ruling concluded that the A380 received improper subsidies through $9 billion of launch aids, but Airbus acknowledges that the threat posed to Boeing by the A380 is so marginal with 330 orders since its 2000 launch that any U.S. sanctions should be minimal, as previous rulings showed Boeing's exposure could be as little as $377 million.[31]\nIn 2018, unit cost was US$445.6 million.[32]\nIn February 2019, the German government disclosed that it was conducting talks with Airbus regarding \u20ac600 million in outstanding loans. Following the decision to wind down the A380 programme, Europe argues that the subsidies in effect no longer exist and that no sanctions are warranted.[33]\nGeographical logistics sequence for the A380, with final assembly in Toulouse\nMajor structural sections of the A380 are built in France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Due to the sections' large size, traditional transportation methods proved unfeasible,[34] so they are brought to the Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re Plant assembly hall in Toulouse, France, by specialised road and water transportation, though some parts are moved by the A300-600ST Beluga transport aircraft.[35][36] A380 components are provided by suppliers from around the world; the four largest contributors, by value, are Rolls-Royce, Safran, United Technologies and General Electric.[16]\nFor the surface movement of large A380 structural components, a complex route known as the Itin\u00e9raire \u00e0 Grand Gabarit was developed. This involved the construction of a fleet of roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ships and barges, the construction of port facilities and the development of new and modified roads to accommodate oversized road convoys.[37] The front and rear fuselage sections are shipped on one of three RORO ships from Hamburg in northern Germany to Saint-Nazaire in France. The ship travels via Mostyn, Wales, where the wings are loaded.[38] The wings are manufactured at Broughton in North Wales, then transported by barge to Mostyn docks for ship transport.[39]\nDrone footage of a wing being transported from its factory at Broughton, Wales, down the River Dee to Mostyn, and onwards to France, March 2020A380 components on a barge\nIn Saint-Nazaire, the ship exchanges the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. This ship unloads in Bordeaux. It then goes to pick up the belly and tail sections from Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA in C\u00e1diz, Spain, and delivers them to Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse.[40] To avoid damage from direct handling, parts are secured in custom jigs carried on self-powered wheeled vehicles.[34]\nAfter assembly, the aircraft are flown to the Airbus Hamburg-Finkenwerder plant to be furnished and painted. Airbus sized the production facilities and supply chain for a production rate of four A380s per month.[39]\nThe first completed A380 at the \"A380 Reveal\" event in Toulouse, France, 18 January 2005A380 prototype on its maiden flight\nOn 1 December 2005, the A380 achieved its maximum design speed of Mach 0.96, (its design cruise speed is Mach 0.85) in a shallow dive.[41] In 2006, the A380 flew its first high-altitude test at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. It conducted its second high-altitude test at the same airport in 2009.[46] On 10 January 2006, it flew to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport in Colombia, accomplishing the transatlantic testing, and then it went to El Dorado International Airport to test the engine operation in high-altitude airports. It arrived in North America on 6 February 2006, landing in Iqaluit, Nunavut, in Canada for cold-weather testing.[47]\nOn 14 February 2006, during the destructive wing strength certification test on MSN5000, the test wing of the A380 failed at 145% of the limit load, short of the required 150% level. Airbus announced modifications adding 30 kg (66 lb) to the wing to provide the required strength.[48] On 26 March 2006, the A380 underwent evacuation certification in Hamburg. With 8 of the 16 exits randomly blocked, 853 mixed passengers and 20 crew exited the darkened aircraft in 78 seconds, less than the 90 seconds required for certification.[49][50] Three days later, the A380 received European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to carry up to 853 passengers.[51]\nThe first A380 using GP7200 engines\u2014serial number MSN009 and flew on 25 August 2006.[52][53] On 4 September 2006, the first full passenger-carrying flight test took place.[54] The aircraft flew from Toulouse with 474 Airbus employees on board, in a test of passenger facilities and comfort.[54] In November 2006, a further series of route-proving flights demonstrated the aircraft's performance for 150 flight hours under typical airline operating conditions.[55] As of 2014[update], the A380 test aircraft continue to perform test procedures.[56]\nInitial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the 530 km (330 mi) of wiring in each aircraft. Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring (98,000 wires and 40,000 connectors), its concurrent design and production, the high degree of customisation for each airline, and failures of configuration management and change control.[60][61] The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version 4, while British and French sites migrated to version 5.[62] This caused overall configuration management problems, at least in part because wire harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules including non-standard dimensions and bend radii; these were not easily transferred between versions of the software.[63] File conversion tools were initially developed by Airbus to help solve this problem; however, the digital mock-up was still unable to read the full technical design data.[64] Furthermore, organisational culture was also cited as a cause of the production delays. The communication and reporting culture at the time frowned upon delivery of bad news, meaning Airbus was unable to take early actions to mitigate technical and production issues.[64]\nAirbus announced the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months.[62] This reduced the total number of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90\u2013100. On 13 June 2006, Airbus announced a second delay, with the delivery schedule slipping an additional six to seven months.[65] Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006, deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft, and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70\u201380 aircraft. The announcement caused a 26% drop in the share price of Airbus' parent, EADS,[66] and led to the departure of EADS CEO No\u00ebl Forgeard, Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert, and A380 programme manager Charles Champion.[62][67] On 3 October 2006, upon completion of a review of the A380 programme, Airbus CEO Christian Streiff announced a third delay,[62] pushing the first delivery to October 2007, to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008, 25 in 2009, and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010.[68] The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to \u20ac4.8 billion.[62][69]\nAs Airbus prioritised the work on the A380-800 over the A380F,[70] freighter orders were cancelled by FedEx[71][72] and United Parcel Service,[73] or converted to A380-800 by Emirates and ILFC.[74] Airbus suspended work on the freighter version, but said it remained on offer,[75] albeit without a service entry date.[76] For the passenger version Airbus negotiated a revised delivery schedule and compensation with the 13 customers, all of which retained their orders with some placing subsequent orders, including Emirates,[77] Singapore Airlines,[78] Qantas,[79] Air France,[80] Qatar Airways,[81] and Korean Air.[82]\nBeginning in 2007, the A380 was considered as a potential replacement for the existing Boeing VC-25 serving as Air Force One presidential transport,[83][84] but in January 2009 EADS declared that they were not going to bid for the contract, as assembling only three planes in the US would not make financial sense.[85]\nOn 13 May 2008, Airbus announced reduced deliveries for the years 2008 (12) and 2009 (21).[86] After further manufacturing setbacks, Airbus announced its plan to deliver 14 A380s in 2009, down from the previously revised target of 18.[87] A total of 10 A380s were delivered in 2009.[88] In 2010 Airbus delivered 18 of the expected 20 A380s, due to Rolls-Royce engine availability problems.[89] Airbus planned to deliver \"between 20 and 25\" A380s in 2011 before ramping up to three a month in 2012.[89] In fact, Airbus delivered 26 units, thus outdoing its predicted output for the first time. As of July 2012[update], production was 3 aircraft per month. Among the production problems are challenging interiors, interiors being installed sequentially rather than concurrently as in smaller planes, and union/government objections to streamlining.[90]\nNicknamed Superjumbo,[91] the first A380, MSN003, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October 2007 with flight number SQ380 between Singapore and Sydney.[92] Passengers bought seats in a charity online auction paying between $560 and $100,380.[93] Two months later, Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than either the airline or Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per seat-mile than the airline's 747-400 fleet.[94] Emirates' Tim Clark claimed that the A380 has better fuel economy at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83,[95] and that its technical dispatch reliability is at 97%, the same as Singapore Airlines. Airbus is committed to reach the industry standard of 98.5%.[96]\nFurthermore, in February 2008, the A380 became the first airliner to fly using synthetic liquid fuel. The fuel is processed from gas to liquid form (GTL fuel). The flight was 3 hours long, taking off from Filton, UK, and landing in Toulouse, France, and was a significant step in evaluating the suitability of sustainable aviation fuels.[101]\nIn 2010, Airbus announced a new A380 build standard, incorporating a strengthened airframe structure and a 1.5\u00b0 increase in wing twist. Airbus also offered, as an option, an improved maximum take-off weight, thus providing a better payload/range performance. Maximum take-off weight is increased by 4 t (8,800 lb), to 573 t (1,263,000 lb) and the range is extended by 100 nautical miles (190 km; 120 mi); this is achieved by reducing flight loads, partly from optimising the fly-by-wire control laws.[102]British Airways and Emirates were the first two customers to have received this new option in 2013.[103] Emirates asked for an update with new engines for the A380 to be competitive with the Boeing 777X around 2020, and Airbus was studying 11-abreast seating.[104]\nIn 2012, Airbus announced another increase in the A380's maximum take-off weight to 575 t (1,268,000 lb), a 6 t increase from the initial A380 variant and 2 t higher than the increased-weight proposal of 2010. This increased the range by some 150 nautical miles (280 km; 170 mi), taking its capability to around 8,350 nautical miles (15,460 km; 9,610 mi) at current payloads. The higher-weight version was offered for introduction to service early in 2013.[105]\nDuring repairs following the Qantas Flight 32 engine failure incident, cracks were discovered in wing fittings. As a result, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an Airworthiness Directive in January 2012 which affected 20 A380 aircraft that had accumulated over 1,300 flights.[106] A380s with under 1,800 flight hours were to be inspected within 6 weeks or 84 flights; aircraft with over 1,800 flight hours were to be examined within four days or 14 flights.[107][108] Fittings found to be cracked were replaced.[109] On 8 February 2012, the checks were extended to cover all 68 A380 aircraft in operation. The problem is considered to be minor and is not expected to affect operations.[110] EADS acknowledged that the cost of repairs would be over $130 million, to be borne by Airbus. The company said the problem was traced to stress and material used for the fittings.[111] Additionally, major airlines are seeking compensation from Airbus for revenue lost as a result of the cracks and subsequent grounding of fleets.[112] Airbus has switched to a different type of aluminium alloy so aircraft delivered from 2014 onwards should not have this problem.[113]\nAround 2014, Airbus changed about 10% of all A380 doors, as some leaked during flight. One occurrence resulted in dropped oxygen masks and an emergency landing. The switch was estimated to cost over \u20ac100 million. Airbus stated that safety was sufficient, as the air pressure pushed the door into the frame.[114][115][116]\nAt the July 2016 Farnborough Airshow Airbus announced that in a \"prudent, proactive step,\" starting in 2018 it expected to deliver 12 A380 aircraft per year, down from 27 deliveries in 2015. The firm also warned production might slip back into red ink (be unprofitable) on each aircraft produced at that time, though it anticipated production would remain in the black (profitable) for 2016 and 2017. \"The company will continue to improve the efficiency of its industrial system to achieve breakeven at 20 aircraft in 2017 and targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower breakeven further.\"[117][118] Airbus expected that healthy demand for its other aircraft would allow it to avoid job losses from the cuts.[119][120]\nAs Airbus expected to build 15 airliners in 2017 and 12 in 2018, Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Br\u00e9gier said that, without orders in 2017, production would be reduced below one per month while remaining profitable per unit and allowing the programme to continue for 20 to 30 years.[121]\nIn its 2017 half-year report, Airbus adjusted 2019 deliveries to eight aircraft.[122]\nIn November 2017, its chief executive Tom Enders was confident Airbus would still produce A380s in 2027 with more sales to come, and further develop it to keep it competitive beyond 2030.[123] Airbus was profitable at a rate of 15 per year and is trying to drive breakeven down further but will take losses at eight per year.[124]\nAn order from Emirates for 36 A380s would have ensured production beyond 2020, but the airline wanted guarantees that production would be maintained for 10 years, until 2028: reducing output to six a year would help to bridge that period and would support second-hand values while other buyers are approached, but the programme would still be unprofitable.[125] If it had failed to win the Emirates order, Airbus claimed that it was ready to phase out its production gradually as it fulfilled remaining orders until the early 2020s.[126] In January 2018, Emirates confirmed the order for 36 A380s,[127][128] but the deal was thrown back into question in October 2018 over a disagreement regarding engine fuel burn.[129]\nTo extend the programme, Airbus offered China a production role in early 2018.[130] While state-owned Chinese airlines could order A380s, it would not help their low yield, as it lowers frequency; they do not need more volume as widebody aircraft are already used on domestic routes and using the A380 on its intended long-haul missions would free only a few airport slots.[131]\nAfter achieving efficiencies to sustain production at a lower level, in 2017 Airbus delivered 15 A380s and was \"very close\" to production breakeven, expecting to make additional savings as production was being further reduced: it planned to deliver 12 in 2018, eight in 2019 and six per year from 2020 with \"digestible\" losses.\nAs of February 2018[update], Enders was confident the A380 would gain additional orders from existing or new operators, and saw opportunities in Asia and particularly in China where it is \"under-represented\".[132]\nIn 2019, Lufthansa had retired 6 of its 14 A380s due to their unprofitability. Later that year Qatar Airways announced a switch from the A380 to the Boeing 777X starting from 2024.[133]\nA6-EVS, the last A380 to roll off the production line at Toulouse, photographed at Heathrow Airport on 19 November 2022. This aircraft, serial number 272, entered service with Emirates on 16 December 2021.[134]\nIn February 2019, Airbus announced it would end A380 production by 2021, after its main customer, Emirates, agreed to drop an order for 39 of the aircraft, replacing it with 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s.[135] At the time of the announcement, Airbus had 17 more A380s on its order book to complete before closing the production line \u2013 14 for Emirates and 3 for All Nippon Airways \u2013 taking the total number of expected deliveries of the aircraft type to 251.[136][137] Airbus would have needed more than $90 million profit from the sale of each aircraft to cover the estimated $25 billion development cost of the programme. However, the $445 million price tag of each aircraft was not sufficient to even cover the production cost, so with Airbus losing money on each A380, and with orders evaporating, it made economic sense to cease production.[138][139] Enders stated on 14 February 2019, \"If you have a product that nobody wants anymore, or you can sell only below production cost, you have to stop it.\"[140]\nOne reason that the A380 did not achieve commercial viability for Airbus has been attributed to its extremely large capacity being optimised for a hub-and-spoke system, which was projected by Airbus to be thriving when the programme was conceived. However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a point-to-point system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Specifically, US based carriers had been using a multihub strategy, which only justified the need for a handful of VLAs (very large aircraft with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.[141] Consequently, orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.[142][143][144][145]\nOn 25 September 2020, Airbus completed assembly of the final A380 fuselage. Nine aircraft remained to be delivered (eight for Emirates, one for All Nippon Airways) and production operations continued to finish those aircraft.[146] On 17 March 2021, the final Airbus A380 (manufacturing serial number 272) made its maiden flight from Toulouse to Hamburg for cabin outfitting,[147] before being delivered to Emirates on 16 December 2021.[148][149]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the A380-800 and the A380F.\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three-class configuration[150] or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration. Then in May 2007, Airbus began marketing a configuration with 30 fewer passengers (525 total in three classes)\u2014traded for 200 nmi; 230 mi (370 km) more range\u2014to better reflect trends in premium-class accommodation.[151] The design range for the A380\u2212800 model is 8,500 nmi (15,700 km);[152] capable of flying from Hong Kong to New York or from Sydney to Istanbul non-stop. The A380 is designed for 19,000 cycles.[153]\nThe second model, the A380F freighter, would have carried 150 t (330,000 lb) of cargo over a range of 5,600 nmi (10,400 km; 6,400 mi).[154] Freighter development was put on hold as Airbus prioritised the passenger version, and all orders for freighters were cancelled.\nOther proposed variants included an A380-900 stretch \u2013 seating about 656 passengers (or up to 960 passengers in an all-economy configuration) \u2013 and an extended-range version with the same passenger capacity as the A380-800.[3]\nThe A380 is offered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 (A380-841/-842) or the Engine Alliance GP7000 (A380-861) turbofan engines.[155]\nThe Trent 900 is a combination of the 3 m (118 in) fan and scaled IP compressor of the 777-200X/300X Trent 8104 technology demonstrator derived from the Boeing 777's Trent 800, and the Airbus A340-500/600's Trent 500 core.\nThe GP7200 HP core technology is derived from GE's GE90 and its LP sections are based on the PW4000 expertise.[156]\nAt its launch in 2000, engine makers assured Airbus it was getting the best level of technology and they would be state-of-the-art for the next decade, but three years later Boeing launched the 787 Dreamliner with game-changing technology and 10% lower fuel burn than the previous generation, to the dismay of John Leahy.[157]\nDue to its modern engines and aerodynamic improvements, Lufthansa's A380s produce half the noise of the Boeing 747-200 while carrying 160 more passengers.[158] In 2012, the A380 received an award from the Noise Abatement Society.[159]\nLondon Heathrow is a key destination for the A380.[3]\nThe aircraft is below the QC/2 departure and QC/0.5 arrival noise limits under the Quota Count system set by the airport.[160] Field measurements suggest the approach quota allocation for the A380 may be overly generous compared to the older Boeing 747, but still quieter.[161][162] Rolls-Royce is supporting the CAA in understanding the relatively high A380/Trent 900 monitored noise levels.[163] Heathrow's landing charges having a noise component, the A380 is cheaper to land there than a Boeing 777-200 and -300 and it saves $4,300 to $5,200 per landing, or $15.3M to $18.8M of present value over 15 years. Tokyo Narita has a similar noise charge.[164]\nSufficient braking capacity allowed for thrust reversers to be installed on only the inboard engines.[165][166] The outboard engines lack them, reducing the amount of debris stirred up during landing.[167] The reversers are electrically actuated to save weight, and for greater reliability than pneumatic or hydraulic equivalents.[168]\nPlanform view showing moderate wing aspect ratio and the undercarriageComposite photo of a structural loading test on the left wing box\nThe A380's wings are sized for a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) over 650 tonnes to accommodate the planned versions, albeit with some internal strengthening required on the A380F freighter.[3][169] The optimal wingspan for this weight is about 90 m (300 ft), but airport restrictions have limited it to less than 80 m (260 ft), thereby lowering the aspect ratio to 7.8 which reduces fuel efficiency[104] by about 10% and increases operating costs a few percent,[170] given that fuel costs constitute about 50% of the cost of long-haul aeroplane operation.[171]\nThe common wing design approach sacrifices fuel efficiency on the A380-800 passenger model because of its weight, but Airbus estimated that the aircraft's size and advanced technology would provide lower operating costs per passenger than the 747-400. The wings incorporate wingtip fences that extend above and below the wing surface, similar to those on the A310 and A320. These increase fuel efficiency and range by reducing induced drag.[172] The wingtip fences also reduce wake turbulence, which endangers following aircraft.[173] The wings of the A380 were designed in Filton and manufactured in Broughton in the United Kingdom. The wings were then transported to the harbour of Mostyn, where they were transported by barge to Toulouse, France, for integration and final assembly with the rest of the aircraft and its components.[174]\nThe hybrid fibre metal laminate material GLARE (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers' leading edges.[181] This aluminium-glass-fibrelaminate is lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation.[182] Unlike earlier composite materials, GLARE can be repaired using conventional aluminium repair techniques.[citation needed]\nNewer weldable aluminium alloys are used in the A380's airframe. This enabled the widespread use of laser beam welding manufacturing techniques, eliminating rows of rivets and resulting in a lighter, stronger structure.[183] High-strength aluminium (type 7449)[184] reinforced with carbon fibre was used in the wing brackets of the first 120 A380s to reduce weight, but cracks were discovered and newer sets of the more critical brackets are made of standard aluminium 7010, increasing weight by 90 kg (198 lb).[185] Repair costs for earlier aircraft were expected to be around \u20ac500 million (US$629 million).[186]\nIt takes 3,600 L (950 US gal) of paint to cover the 3,100 m2 (33,000 sq ft) exterior of an A380.[187] The paint is five layers thick and weighs about 650 kg (1,433 lb) when dry.[188]\nThe Network Systems Server (NSS) is the heart of A380s paperless cockpit; it eliminates bulky manuals and traditional charts.[199][200] The NSS has enough inbuilt robustness to eliminate onboard backup paper documents. The A380s network and server system stores data and offers electronic documentation, providing a required equipment list, navigation charts, performance calculations, and an aircraft logbook. This is accessed through the MFDs and controlled via the keyboard interface.[193]\nPower-by-wire flight control actuators have been used for the first time in civil aviation to back up primary hydraulic actuators. Also, during certain manoeuvres they augment the primary actuators.[201] They have self-contained hydraulic and electrical power supplies. Electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA) are used in the aileron and elevator, electric and hydraulic motors to drive the slats as well as electrical backup hydrostatic actuators (EBHA) for the rudder and some spoilers.[202]\nThe A380's 350 bar (35 MPa or 5,000 psi) hydraulic system is a significant difference from the typical 210 bar (21 MPa or 3,000 psi) hydraulics used on most commercial aircraft since the 1940s.[203][204] First used in military aircraft, high-pressure hydraulics reduce the weight and size of pipelines, actuators and related components. The 350 bar pressure is generated by eight de-clutchable hydraulic pumps.[204][205] The hydraulic lines are typically made from titanium; the system features both fuel- and air-cooled heat exchangers. Self-contained electrically powered hydraulic power packs serve as backups for the primary systems, instead of a secondary hydraulic system, saving weight and reducing maintenance.[206]\nThe A380 uses four 150 kVA variable-frequency electrical generators,[207] eliminating constant-speed drives and improving reliability.[208] The A380 uses aluminium power cables instead of copper for weight reduction. The electrical power system is fully computerised and many contactors and breakers have been replaced by solid-state devices for better performance and increased reliability.[202]\nThe auxiliary power comprises the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), the electronic control box (ECB), and mounting hardware. The APU in use on the A380 is the 1,300 kW PW 980A APU. The APU primarily provides air to power the Analysis Ground Station (AGS) on the ground and to start the engines. The AGS is a semi-automatic analysis system of flight data that helps to optimise management of maintenance and reduce costs. The APU also powers two 120 kVA electric generators that provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft. There is also a ram air turbine (RAT) with a 70 kVA generator.[209]\nTen-abreast old economy class seating on the main deck on an Emirates A380\nThe A380-800's cabin has 550 square metres (5,920 sq ft) of usable floor space,[210] 40% more than the next largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8.[211]\nThe cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generations of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of 1,520 m (5,000 ft) up to 12,000 m (39,000 ft).[212][3]: 129 It has 50% less cabin noise, 50% more cabin area and volume, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and 60 cm (2.0 ft) more headroom than the 747-400.[213][214] Seating options range from 3-room 12 m2 (130 sq ft) \"residence\" in first class to 11-across in economy.[215] A380 economy seats are up to 48 cm (19 in) wide in a 10-abreast configuration,[216] compared with the 10-abreast configuration on the 747-400 that typically has seats 44.5 cm (17.5 in) wide.[217] On other aircraft, economy seats range from 41.5 to 52.3 cm (16.3 to 20.6 in) in width.[218]\nThe A380's upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways, one fore and one aft, both wide enough to accommodate two passengers side by side; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations. The maximum certified carrying capacity is 853 passengers in an all-economy-class layout,[49] Airbus lists the \"typical\" three-class layout as accommodating 525 passengers, with 10 first, 76 business, and 439 economy class seats.[151] Airline configurations range from Korean Air's 407 passengers to Emirates' two-class 615 seats[219] and average around 480\u2013490 seats.[220][221] The Air Austral's proposed 840 passenger layout has not come to fruition. The A380's interior illumination system uses bulbless LEDs in the cabin, cockpit, and cargo decks. The LEDs in the cabin can be altered to create an ambience simulating daylight, night, or intermediate levels.[222] On the outside of the aircraft, HID lighting is used for brighter illumination.\nAirbus's publicity has stressed the comfort and space of the A380 cabin,[223] and advertised onboard relaxation areas such as bars, beauty salons, duty-free shops, and restaurants.[224][225] Proposed amenities resembled those installed on earlier airliners, particularly 1970s wide-body jets,[226] which largely gave way to regular seats for more passenger capacity.[226] Airbus has acknowledged that some cabin proposals were unlikely to be installed,[225] and that it was ultimately the airlines' decision how to configure the interior.[226] Industry analysts suggested that implementing customisation has slowed the production speeds, and raised costs.[227] Due to delivery delays, Singapore Airlines and Air France debuted their seat designs on different aircraft prior to the A380.[228][229]\nInitial operators typically configured their A380s for three-class service, while adding extra features for passengers in premium cabins. Launch customer Singapore Airlines introduced partly enclosed first-class suites on its A380s in 2007, each featuring a leather seat with a separate bed; center suites could be joined to create a double bed.[230][231][232] A year later, Qantas debuted a new first-class seat-bed and a sofa lounge at the front of the upper deck on its A380s,[233][234] and in 2009 Air France unveiled an upper deck electronic art gallery.[235] In late 2008, Emirates introduced \"shower spas\" in first class on its A380s allowing each first class passenger five minutes of hot water,[236][237] drawing on 2.5 tonnes of water, although only 60% of it was used.[238]\nEtihad Airways and Qatar Airways also have a bar lounge and seating area on the upper deck, while Etihad has enclosed areas for two people each.[239] In addition to lounge areas, some A380 operators have installed amenities consistent with other aircraft in their respective fleets, including self-serve snack bars,[240]premium economy sections,[229] and redesigned business-class seating.[228]\nThe Hamburg Aircraft Interiors Expo in April 2015 saw the presentation of an 11-seat row economy cabin for the A380. Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three-class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11-seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the Airbus A330 and ten across on the A350.[241]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747. In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with manufacturers, airports and its member agencies, the \"80-metre box\" was created, the airport gates allowing planes up to 80 m (260 ft) wingspan and length to be accommodated.[242] Airbus designed the A380 according to these guidelines,[243][244] and to operate safely on Group V runways and taxiways with a 60 metres (200 ft) loadbearing width.[245] The US FAA initially opposed this,[246][247] then in July 2007, the FAA and EASA agreed to let the A380 operate on 45 m (148 ft) runways without restrictions.[248] The A380-800 is approximately 30% larger in overall size than the 747-400.[249][250] Runway lighting and signage may need changes to provide clearance to the wings and avoid blast damage from the engines. Runways, runway shoulders and taxiway shoulders may be required to be stabilised to reduce the likelihood of foreign object damage caused to (or by) the outboard engines, which are more than 25 m (82 ft) from the centre line of the aircraft,[243][245][251] compared to 21 m (69 ft) for the 747-400,[252] and 747-8.[253]\nAirbus measured pavement loads using a 540-tonne (595 short tons) ballasted test rig, designed to replicate the landing gear of the A380. The rig was towed over a section of pavement at Airbus's facilities that had been instrumented with embedded load sensors.[254] It was determined that the pavement of most runways will not need to be reinforced despite the higher weight,[251] as it is distributed on more wheels than in other passenger aircraft with a total of 22 wheels (that is, its ground pressure is lower).[255] The A380 undercarriage consists of four main landing gear legs and one noseleg (a layout similar to that of the 747), with the two inboard landing gear legs each supporting six wheels.[255][256]\nThe A380 requires service vehicles with lifts capable of reaching the upper deck,[257] as well as tractors capable of handling the A380's maximum ramp weight.[258] When using two jetway bridges the boarding time is 45 min, and when using an extra jetway to the upper deck it is reduced to 34 min.[259] The A380 has an airport turnaround time of 90\u2013110 minutes.[238] In 2008 the A380 test aircraft were used to trial the modifications made to several airports to accommodate the type.[260]\nIn 2005, the ICAO recommended that provisional separation criteria for the A380 on takeoff[262] and landing be substantially greater than for the 747 because preliminary flight test data suggested a stronger wake turbulence.[263][264] These criteria were in effect while the ICAO's wake vortex steering group, with representatives from the JAA, Eurocontrol, the FAA, and Airbus, refined its 3-year study of the issue with additional flight testing. In September 2006, the working group presented its first conclusions to the ICAO.[265][266]\nIn November 2006, the ICAO issued new interim recommendations. Replacing a blanket 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) separation for aircraft trailing an A380 during approach, the new distances were 6 nmi (11 km; 6.9 mi), 8 nmi (15 km; 9.2 mi) and 10 nmi (19 km; 12 mi) respectively for non-A380 \"Heavy\", \"Medium\", and \"Light\" ICAO aircraft categories. These compared with the 4 nmi (7.4 km; 4.6 mi), 5 nmi (9.3 km; 5.8 mi) and 6 nmi (11 km; 6.9 mi) spacing applicable to other \"Heavy\" aircraft. Another A380 following an A380 should maintain a separation of 4 nmi (7.4 km). On departure behind an A380, non-A380 \"Heavy\" aircraft are required to wait two minutes, and \"Medium\"/\"Light\" aircraft three minutes for time based operations. The ICAO also recommends that pilots append the term \"Super\" to the aircraft's callsign when initiating communication with air traffic control, to distinguish the A380 from \"Heavy\" aircraft.[267]\nIn August 2008, the ICAO issued revised approach separations of 4 nmi (7.4 km; 4.6 mi) for Super (another A380), 6 nmi (11 km; 6.9 mi) for Heavy, 7 nmi (13 km; 8.1 mi) for medium/small, and 8 nmi (15 km; 9.2 mi) for light.[268] In November 2008, an incident on a parallel runway during crosswinds made the Australian authorities change procedures for those conditions.[269]\nAs the A380 fleet grows older, airworthiness authority rules require certain scheduled inspections from approved aircraft tool shops. The increasing fleet size (to about 286 in 2020) cause expected maintenance and modification to cost $6.8 billion for 2015\u20132020, of which $2.1 billion are for engines. Emirates performed its first 3C-check for 55 days in 2014. During lengthy shop stays, some airlines will use the opportunity to install new interiors.[270]\nIn February 2009, the one millionth passenger was flown with Singapore Airlines[271] and by May of that year 1,500,000 passengers had flown on 4,200 flights.[272]Air France received its first A380 in October 2009.[273][274]Lufthansa received its first A380 in May 2010.[275] By July 2010, the 31 A380s then in service had transported 6 million passengers on 17,000 flights between 20 international destinations.[276]\nAirbus delivered the 100th A380 on 14 March 2013 to Malaysia Airlines.[277] In June 2014, over 65 million passengers had flown the A380,[278] and more than 100 million passengers (averaging 375 per flight) by September 2015, with an availability of 98.5%.[279] In 2014, Emirates stated that its A380 fleet had load factors of 90\u2013100%, and that the popularity of the aircraft with its passengers had not decreased in the past year.[238]\nOn 16 December 2021, the largest customer Emirates received its 123rd A380 in Hamburg, which was the 251st and the last Superjumbo delivered by Airbus. The airline's strategy has enabled A380 teams to develop new innovations on an ongoing basis and improve the aircraft's operational performance by up to 99.3%, a level never seen before on a quadjet airliner. Many of the innovations developed on the Emirates A380 cabin were a first for Airbus, such as the first class showers, lighting scenarios and the recent premium economy cabin. The close collaboration has shaped the identity of the A380 over the years and continues to transform the passenger experience today.[2]\nBy December 2021[update], the global A380 fleet had carried over 300 million passengers to more than 70 destinations and completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with 99 percent operational reliability and no hull-loss accidents. Over 50% of A380 capacity is from/to/within the Asia-Pacific region, of which around 15% is on regional flights within Asia (OAG 2017).[280]\nThe A380F, a cargo variant of the A380, was proposed but postponed after 2005 and never built.\nAirbus offered a cargo aircraft variant, called the A380F, since at least June 2005, capable of transporting a 150 t (330,000 lb) maximum payload over a 5,600 nmi (10,400 km; 6,400 mi) range.[154] It would have had 7% better payload and better range than the Boeing 747-8F, but also higher trip costs.[281] It would have the largest payload capacity of any freighter aircraft except the Antonov An-225 Mriya.\nProduction was suspended until the A380 production lines had settled, with no firm availability date.[70][71][72] The A380F was displayed on the Airbus website until at least January 2013,[282][non-primary source needed] but was not anymore in April.[283][non-primary source needed]\nA patent for a \"combi\" version was applied for. This version would offer the flexibility of carrying both passengers and cargo, along with being rapidly reconfigurable to expand or contract the cargo area and passenger area as needed for a given flight.[284]\nAt launch in December 2000, a 656-seat A380-200 was proposed as a derivative of the 555-seat baseline, called the A380 Stretch.[285]\nOn 11 December 2014, at the annual Airbus Investor Day forum, Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier controversially announced, \"We will one day launch an A380neo and one day launch a stretched A380\".[295] This statement followed speculation sparked by Airbus CFO Harald Wilhelm that Airbus could possibly axe the A380 ahead of its time due to softening demand.[296]\nOn 15 June 2015, John Leahy, Airbus's chief operating officer for customers, stated that Airbus was again looking at the A380-900 programme. Airbus's newest concept would be a stretch of the A380-800 offering 50 seats more\u2014not 100 seats as originally envisaged. This stretch would be tied to a potential re-engining of the A380-800. According to Flight Global, an A380-900 would make better use of the A380's existing wing.[297]\nOn 15 June 2015, Reuters reported that Airbus was discussing an improved and stretched version of the A380 with at least six customers. The aircraft, called the A380neo, featured new engines and would accommodate an additional fifty passengers. Deliveries to customers were planned for sometime in 2020 or 2021.[298] On 19 July 2015, Airbus CEO Fabrice Br\u00e9gier stated that the company will build a new version of the A380 featuring new improved wings and new engines.[299] Speculation about the development of a so-called A380neo (\"neo\" for \"new engine option\") had been going on for a few months after earlier press releases in 2014,[300] and in 2015 the company was considering whether to end production of the type prior to 2018[296] or develop a new A380 variant. Later it was revealed that Airbus was looking at both the possibility of a longer A380 in line of the previously planned A380-900[301] and a new engine version, i.e. A380neo. Br\u00e9gier also revealed that the new variant would be ready to enter service by 2020.[302] The engine would most likely be one of a variety of all-new options from Rolls-Royce, ranging from derivatives of the A350's XWB-84/97 to the future Advance project due at around 2020.[303][304]\nOn 3 June 2016, Emirates President Tim Clark stated that talks between Emirates and Airbus on the A380neo have \"lapsed\".[305] On 12 June 2017, Fabrice Br\u00e9gier confirmed that Airbus would not launch an A380neo, stating \"...there is no business case to do that, this is absolutely clear.\" However, Br\u00e9gier stated it would not stop Airbus from looking at what could be done to improve the performance of the aircraft. One such proposal is a 32 ft (9.8 m) wingspan extension to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency by 4%,[306] though further increase is likely to be seen on the aircraft with new Sharklets like on the A380plus.[306]\nTim Clark stated the proposed re-engining would have offered a 12-14% fuel-burn reduction with an enhanced Trent XWB.[307]\nIn June 2023, despite A380 production having ceased, Clark renewed his plea for a re-engined A380neo, suggesting that a next-generation Rolls-Royce UltraFan could give a 25% reduction in fuel burn and emissions.[308]\nThe winglet (mockup) on the A380plus\nAt the June 2017 Paris Air Show, Airbus proposed an enhanced variant, called the A380plus, with 13% lower costs per seat, featuring up to 80 more seats through better use of cabin space, split scimitar winglets and wing refinements allowing a 4% fuel economy improvement, and longer aircraft maintenance intervals with less downtime.[309] The A380plus' maximum takeoff weight would have been increased by 3 t (6,600 lb) to 578 t (1,274,000 lb), allowing it to carry more passengers over the same 8,200 nmi (15,200 km; 9,400 mi) range or increase the range by 300 nmi (560 km; 350 mi).\nWinglet mockups, 4.7 m (15 ft 5 in) high, were displayed on the MSN04 test aircraft at Le Bourget. Wing twist would have been modified and camber changed by increasing its height by 33 millimetres (1+1\u20444 in) between Rib 10 and Rib 30, along with upper-belly fairing improvements. The in-flight entertainment, the flight management system and the fuel pumps would be from the A350 to reduce weight and improve reliability and fuel economy. Light checks for the A380plus would be required after 1,000 h instead of 750 h and heavy check downtime would be reduced to keep the aircraft flying for six days more per year.[310]\nIn its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus estimated a demand for 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats: 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019.[311]\nIn late 2003, Boeing forecast 320 \"Boeing 747 and larger\" passenger aircraft over 20 years, close to the 298 orders actually placed for the A380 and 747-8 passenger airliners as of March 2020.[312]\nIn 2007, Airbus estimated a demand for 1,283 VLAs in the following 20 years if airport congestion remains constant, up to 1,771 VLAs if congestion increases, with most deliveries (56%) in Asia-Pacific, and 415 very large, 120-tonne plus freighters.[313] For the same period, Boeing was estimating the demand for 590 large (747 or A380) passenger airliners and 630 freighters.[314]\nEstimates for the total over a twenty-year period have varied from 400 to over 1,700.[16][315]\nIn 2014, British Airways replaced three 777 flights between London and Los Angeles with two A380 per day.[320] Emirates' Tim Clark saw a large potential for Asian A380-users, and criticised Airbus' marketing efforts.[321] As many business travellers prefer more choices offered by greater flight frequency achieved by flying any given route multiple times on smaller aircraft, rather than fewer flights on larger planes, United Airlines observed the A380 \"just doesn't really work for us\". It employs Boeing 787s operating at a lower trip cost.[322]\nAt the A380 launch, most Europe-Asia and transpacific routes used Boeing 747-400s at fairly low frequencies but, since then, routes proliferated with open skies, and most airlines downsized, offering higher frequencies and more routes.\nThe huge capacity offered by each flight eroded the yield: North America was viewed as 17% of the market but the A380 never materialised as a 747 replacement, with only 15 747s remaining in passenger service in November 2017 for transpacific routes, where time zones restrict potential frequency. Consolidation changed the networks, and US majors constrained capacity and emphasised daily frequencies for business traffic with midsize widebodies like the 787, to extract higher yields; the focus being on profits, with market share ceded to Asian carriers.[311]\nThe 747 was largely replaced on transatlantic flights by the 767, and on the transpacific market by the 777[citation needed]; newer, smaller aircraft with similar seat-mile costs have lower trip costs and allow more direct routes.\nCabin 'densification', to lower unit costs, could aggravate this overcapacity.[311]\nIn 2005, 270 sales were necessary to attain break-even and with 751 expected deliveries its internal rate of return outlook was at 19%, but due to disruptions in the ramp-up leading to overcosts and delayed deliveries, it increased to 420 in 2006.[323] In 2010, EADS CFO Hans Peter Ring said that break-even could be achieved by 2015 when 200 deliveries were projected.[324] In 2012, Airbus clarified that the aircraft production costs would be less than its sales price.[90]\nOn 11 December 2014, Airbus chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm hinted the possibility of ending the programme in 2018, disappointing Emirates president Tim Clark.[325] Airbus shares fell down consequently.[326] Airbus responded to the protests by playing down the possibility the A380 would be abandoned, instead emphasising that enhancing the aeroplane was a likelier scenario.[327] On 22 December 2014, as the jet was about to break even, Airbus CEO Fabrice Br\u00e9gier ruled out cancelling it.[328]\nTen years after its first flight, Br\u00e9gier said it was \"almost certainly introduced ten years too early\".[329] While no longer losing money on each plane sold, Airbus admits that the company will never recoup the $25 billion investment it made in the project.[330]\nAirbus consistently forecast 1,400 VLA demand over 20-year, still in 2017, and aimed to secure a 50% share, up to 700 units, but delivered 215 aircraft in 10 years, achieving three produced per month but not the four per month target after the ramp-up to achieve more than 350 and is now declining to 0.5 a month.\nAs Boeing see the VLA market as too small to retain in its 2017 forecast, its VP marketing Randy Tinseth does not believe Airbus will deliver the rest of the backlog.[311]\nRichard Aboulafia predicts a 2020 final delivery, with unpleasant losses due to \"hubris, shoddy market analysis, nationalism and simple wishful thinking\".\nIn 2017, the A380 fleet exceeded the number of remaining passenger B747s, which had declined from 740 aircraft when the A380 was launched in 2000 to 550 units when the A380 was introduced in 2007, and around 200 ten years later. However, the market-share battle has shifted to large single-aisles and 300-seat twin-aisles.[311]\nAs of 2016[update] the list price of an A380 was US$432.6 million.[331] Negotiated discounts made the actual prices much lower, and industry experts questioned whether the A380 project would ever pay for itself.[90] The first aircraft was sold and leased back by Singapore Airlines in 2007 to Dr. Peters for $197 million.[332] In 2016, IAG's Willie Walsh said he could add a few, but also that he found the price of new aircraft \"outrageous\" and would source them from the second-hand market.[311]\nAirInsight estimates its hourly cost at $26,000, or around $50 per seat hour (when configured for only 520 seats), which compares to $44 per seat hour for a Boeing 777-300ER, and $90 per seat hour for a Boeing 747-400 as of November 2015[update].[333] The A380 was designed with large wing and tail surfaces to accommodate a planned stretch; this resulted in a high empty weight per seat.[311] The stretch never occurred to take advantage of this, and the A380's cost-per-seat is expected to be matched by the A350-1000 and 777-9.[311]\nAs of mid-2015, several airlines expressed their interest in selling their aircraft, partially coinciding with expiring lease contracts for the aircraft. Several in-service A380s were offered for lease to other airlines. The suggestion prompted concerns on the potential for new sales for Airbus, although these were dismissed by Airbus COO John Leahy who stated that \"Used A380s do not compete with new A380s\", noting that the second-hand market is more interesting for parties otherwise looking to buy smaller aircraft such as the Boeing 777.[334]\nAfter Malaysia Airlines was unable to sell or lease its six A380s, it decided to refurbish the aircraft with seating for 700 and transfer them to a subsidiary carrier for religious pilgrimage flights.[335] As it started receiving its six A350s to replace its A380s in December 2017, the new subsidiary will serve the Hajj and Umrah market with them, starting in the third quarter of 2018 and could be expanded above six beyond 2020 to 2022. The cabin will have 36 business seats and 600 economy seats, with a 712-seat reconfiguration possible within five days. The fleet could be chartered half the year for the tourism industry like cruise shipping and will be able to operate for the next 40 years if oil prices stay low.[336]\nAs they should be parked by June 2018 before reconfiguration, MAS confirmed the plans and will also use them for peak periods to high traffic markets like London.[337]\nIn August 2017, it was announced that Hi Fly would lease two used aircraft. The Portuguese ACMI/charter airline will use the aircraft for markets where high capacity is needed and airports where slots are scarce. The first aircraft was scheduled to begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2018[338][339] Hi Fly was to receive its A380s from mid-2018 in a 471-seat configuration: 399 on the main deck, 60 business-class and 12 first-class seats on the upper deck, the Singapore Airlines layout.[340] Hi Fly first used one of their A380s on 1 August 2018 for a one-off flight to enable Thomas Cook Airlines to repatriate passengers from Rhodes to Copenhagen following IT problems in the Greek airport.[341] The same aircraft was then wet-leased to Norwegian to operate its evening London-New York service for several weeks in August 2018, to alleviate availability issues on its Boeing 787s affected by Trent 1000 engine problems;[342] Air Austral also signed a deal to wet-lease an A380 from Hi Fly while one of its 787s is grounded for three months of Trent 1000 inspections.[343]\nAs of December 2019, Hi Fly have leased one used A380.\nAmedeo, mainly an A380 lessor and the largest with 22, mostly leased to Emirates, wants to find a use for them after their lease expires from 2022, and study if there is a demand to wet lease them.[344]\nSwiss aircraft broker Sparfell & Partners plans to convert for head-of-state or VVIP transport some of Dr. Peters' four ex-SIA A380s for under $300 million apiece, less than a new Boeing 777 or Airbus A330.[345]\nAs of November 2018, Air France was planning to return five of its A380s to lessors by the end of 2019 and refurbish its other five with new interiors by 2020 for $51 million per aircraft.[346] By July 2019, Air France revised this plan and intended to phase out all ten of its A380s by 2022 as part of an \"accelerated\" retirement plan, replacing them with no more than nine twin-engined wide-body aircraft. The A330-900, A350-900 and 787-9 were being evaluated as potential replacements.[347]\nFollowing the cancellation of the programme in February 2019, the residual value of existing aircraft is in doubt. While Amedeo argued that cancellation should benefit the value, this will depend on whether any new airlines are prepared to adopt second-hand A380s, and how many existing users continue to operate the aircraft. Even the teardown value is questionable, in that the engines, usually the most valuable part of a scrap aircraft, are not used by any other models.[348]\nWith four A380s leased to Singapore Airlines having been returned between October 2017 and March 2018, Dr. Peters feared a weak aftermarket and is considering scrapping them, although they are on sale for a business jet conversion, but on the other hand Airbus sees a potential for African airlines and Chinese airlines, Hajj charters and its large Gulf operators.[349] An A380 parted out may be worth $30 million to $50 million if it is at half-life.[350]Teardown specialists have declined offers for several aircraft at part-out prices due to high risk as a secondary market is uncertain with $30 to $40 million for the refurbishment, but should be between $20 and $30 million to be viable.[351]\nWhen the aircraft were proposed to British Airways, Hi Fly and Iran Air, BA did not want to replace its Boeing 747s until 2021, while Iran Air faced political uncertainty and Hi Fly did not have a convincing business case. Consequently, Dr. Peters recommended to its investors on 28 June 2018 to sell the aircraft parts with VAS Aero Services within two years for US$45 million, quickly for components like the landing gear or the APU.\nRolls-Royce Trent 900 leasing beyond March 2019 should generate US$480,000 monthly for each aircraft before selling the turbofans by 2020. With a total revenue of US$80 million per aircraft, the overall return expected is 145\u2013155% while 72% and 81% of their debt had already been repaid.[352]\nThe fifth plane coming back from SIA, owned by Doric, has been leased by Hi Fly Malta with a lease period of \"nearly 6 years\".[353] Hi Fly Malta became the first operator of second-hand A380 (MSN006).[354]Norwegian Long Haul briefly leased Hi Fly Malta A380 in August 2018, which operated the aircraft following engine problems with their Dreamliner fleet.[355] Norwegian leased the A380 again in late 2018 to help deal with the passenger backlog as a result of the Gatwick Airport drone incident.\nTwo others returned from Singapore Airlines in the coming weeks (June 2018) but they could stay with an existing Asian A380 flag carrier.[356][357]\nThe teardown value includes $32\u2013$33 million from the engines in 2020 and $4 million from leasing them until then, while the value of a 2008 A380 would be $78.4 million in 2020 and its monthly lease in 2018 would be $929,000.\nThe two aircraft have returned 3.8\u20134.2% per year since 2008 but the 145\u2013155% return is lower than the 220% originally forecast.\nOf the nearly 500 made, 50 747-400s were sold in the secondary market, including only 25 to new customers.[358]\nThese are among the first A380s delivered, lacking the improvements and weight savings of later ones.[359]\nThe first two A380s delivered to Singapore Airlines (MSN003 and MSN005) flew to Tarbes, France, to be scrapped. Their engines and some components had been dismantled and removed while the livery was painted over in white.[360]\nAs of September 2019, Emirates initiated its A380 retirement plan \u2013 which will see the type remain in service until at least 2035 \u2013 by retiring two aircraft that were due for a major overhaul, and using them as parts donors for the rest of the fleet. Emirates does not see any demand in the second-hand market, but is indifferent in that the retired aircraft have already been fully written down and thus have no residual value. As further aircraft are retired, Emirates-owned airframes will continue to be used for parts, while leased airframes will be returned to the lessors.[361] One such return to lessor Doric was purchased by Emirates for \u00a325.3 million in late 2022, as spare parts.[362]\nCo-branding with Airbus branding along with customer airlines' logos on an A380 fuselage during MAKS, an air show, 2011One of the three different A380 ANA 'Flying Honu' liveries (Honu: sea turtle)\nFourteen customers have ordered and taken delivery of the A380 as of April 2019. Total orders for the A380 stand at 251 as of November 2019[update].[363] The biggest customer is Emirates, which has committed to order a total of 123 A380s as of 14 February 2019.[363][364] One VIP order was made in 2007[365] but later cancelled by Airbus.[366] The A380F version attracted 27 orders, before they were either cancelled (20) or converted to A380-800 (7) following the production delay and the subsequent suspension of the freighter programme.\nDelivery takes place in Hamburg for customers from Europe and the Middle East and in Toulouse for customers from the rest of the world.[367] EADS explained that deliveries in 2013 were to be slowed temporarily to accommodate replacement of the wing rib brackets where cracks were detected earlier in the existing fleet.[368]\nIn 2013, in expectation of raising the number of orders placed, Airbus announced \"attractable discounts\" to airlines who placed large orders for the A380.[failed verification] Soon after, at the November 2013 Dubai Air Show where Emirates ordered 150 777X and Etihad Airways ordered 50 aircraft, totalling $20 billion.[369]\nIn late July 2014, Airbus announced that it had terminated five A380 firm orders from the Japanese low-cost carrier, Skymark Airlines, citing concerns over the airline's financial performance.[370] In 2016, the largest Japanese carrier, All Nippon Airways (ANA), took over three of the orders and the remaining two that were already produced and put into long-term storage were taken up later by the main customer, Emirates Airlines.[371]Qantas planned to order eight more aircraft but froze its order while the airline restructured its operations.[372] Qantas eventually cancelled its order in February 2019 amid doubts over the A380's future.[373]\nAmedeo, an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s, had not found a client for the airliner and eventually cancelled their order in 2019.[374][375]Virgin Atlantic ordered six A380s in 2001 but never took delivery and later cancelled them in 2018.[376]\nIn June 2017, Emirates had 48 orders outstanding, but due to lack of space in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and would not take any in 2019\u201320 before replacing its early airliners from 2021. There were open production slots in 2019, and Airbus reduced its production rate in 2017\u20132018 at 12 per year. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them any more and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.[377]\nAt its 100th delivery ceremony, Emirates CEO Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum was hoping to order new A380s at the November 2017 Dubai Air Show.[378]\nEmirates does not need the small front staircase and eleven-abreast economy of the A380plus concept, but wants Airbus to commit to continue production for at least 10 years.[124]\nOn 18 January 2018, Airbus secured a preliminary agreement from Emirates for up to 36 A380s, to be delivered from 2020, valued at $16 billion at list prices.[379] The contract was signed in February 2018, comprising a firm order for 20 A380s and options on 16 more.[380]\nIn early 2019, Airbus confirmed it was in discussions with Emirates over its A380 contract.[381]\nIf the A380's only stable client were to drop the type, Airbus could cease production of the superjumbo.[382] Emirates is at odds with Rolls-Royce over shortfalls in fuel savings from the Trent 900s, and could switch its order for 36 A380s to the smaller A350.[383] The A350 could also replace its provisional order for 40 Boeing 787-10s, placed in 2017, as engine margins on the 787 are insufficient for the hot Dubai weather.[384][385]\nOn 14 February 2019, Emirates decided to cancel its order for 39 planes, opting to replace them with A350s and A330neos.[135] Airbus stated that this cancellation would bring the A380's production to an end when the last unfilled orders are delivered in 2021.[135][386]\nEmirates - 104[392] A380s currently in service in operational fleet (first service on 1 August 2008)[98] Retirement of its A380s is planned to be started after 2035.

The plane safely returned to Singapore. There were no injuries to the passengers, the crew, or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam.[428] The A380 was damaged sufficiently for the event to be classified as an accident.[429] Qantas subsequently grounded all of its A380s that day subject to an internal investigation taken in conjunction with the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc. A380s powered by Engine Alliance GP7000 were unaffected, but operators of Rolls-Royce Trent 900-powered A380s were affected. Investigators determined that an oil leak, caused by a defective oil supply pipe, led to an engine fire and subsequent uncontained engine failure.[430] Repairs cost an estimated A$139 million (~US$145M).[431] As other Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines also showed problems with the same oil leak, Rolls-Royce ordered many engines to be changed, including about half of the engines in the Qantas A380 fleet.[432] During the aeroplane's repair, cracks were discovered in wing structural fittings, which also resulted in mandatory inspections of all A380s and subsequent design changes.[106]\n^Flottau, Jens (21 November 2012). \"Emirates A350-1000 Order 'In Limbo'\".

        "context": "\nHuman languages ranked by their number of native speakers are as follows. All such rankings should be used with caution, because it is not possible to devise a coherent set of linguistic criteria for distinguishing languages in a dialect continuum.[1] For example, a language is often defined as a set of mutually intelligible varieties, but independent national standard languages may be considered separate languages even though they are largely mutually intelligible, as in the case of Danish and Norwegian.[2] Conversely, many commonly accepted languages, including German, Italian and even English encompass varieties that are not mutually intelligible.[1] While Arabic is sometimes considered a single language centred on Modern Standard Arabic, other authors consider its mutually unintelligible varieties separate languages.[3] Similarly, Chinese is sometimes viewed as a single language because of a shared culture and common literary language.[4] It is also common to describe various Chinese dialect groups, such as Mandarin, Wu and Yue, as languages, even though each of these groups contains many mutually unintelligible varieties.[5]\nThere are also difficulties in obtaining reliable counts of speakers, which vary over time because of population change and language shift. In some areas, there is no reliable census data, the data is not current, or the census may not record languages spoken, or record them ambiguously. Sometimes speaker populations are exaggerated for political reasons, or speakers of minority languages may be underreported in favour of a national language.[6]",

(In this chart, the \"0\" value is the average temperature from 1850\u20131900, which is considered the \"pre-industrial\" temperature level.)\nThe instrumental temperature record is a record of temperatures within Earth's climate based on direct, instrument-based measurements of air temperature and ocean temperature. Instrumental temperature records are distinguished from indirect reconstructions using climate proxy data such as from tree rings and ocean sediments.[1] Instrument-based data are collected from thousands of meteorological stations, buoys and ships around the globe. Whilst many heavily-populated areas have a high density of measurements, observations are more widely spread in sparsely populated areas such as polar regions and deserts, as well as over many parts of Africa and South America.[2] Measurements were historically made using mercury or alcohol thermometers which were read manually, but are increasingly made using electronic sensors which transmit data automatically. Records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures. A temperature anomaly is measured against a reference value (also called baseline period or long-term average). For example, a commonly used baseline period is the time period 1951-1980.\nThe longest-running temperature record is the Central England temperature data series, which starts in 1659. The longest-running quasi-global records start in 1850.[3] Temperatures are also measured in the upper atmosphere using a variety of methods, including radiosondes launched using weather balloons, a variety of satellites, and aircraft.[4] Satellites are used extensively to monitor temperatures in the upper atmosphere but to date have generally not been used to assess temperature change at the surface. In recent decades, global surface temperature datasets have been supplemented by extensive sampling of ocean temperatures at various depths, allowing estimates of ocean heat content.\nAverage surface air temperatures from 2011 to 2021 compared to the baseline of 1956\u20131976.[6]\nInstrumental temperature records are based on direct, instrument-based measurements of air temperature and ocean temperature, unlike indirect reconstructions using climate proxy data such as from tree rings and ocean sediments.[1] The longest-running temperature record is the Central England temperature data series, which starts in 1659. The longest-running quasi-global records start in 1850.[3] Temperatures on other time scales are explained in global temperature record.\n\"Global temperature\" can have different definitions. There is a small difference between air and surface temperatures.[7]: 12\nExterior of a Stevenson screen used for temperature measurements on land stations.Interior of a Stevenson screen\nThe period for which reasonably reliable instrumental records of near-surface temperature exist with quasi-global coverage is generally considered to begin around 1850. Earlier records exist, but with sparser coverage, largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere, and less standardized instrumentation.\nThe temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships. On land, temperatures are measured either using electronic sensors, or mercury or alcohol thermometers which are read manually, with the instruments being sheltered from direct sunlight using a shelter such as a Stevenson screen. The sea record consists of ships taking sea temperature measurements, mostly from hull-mounted sensors, engine inlets or buckets, and more recently includes measurements from moored and drifting buoys. The land and marine records can be compared.\nMost meteorological observations are taken for use in weather forecasts. Centers such as European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts show instantaneous map of their coverage; or the Hadley Centre show the coverage for the average of the year 2000. Coverage for earlier in the 20th and 19th centuries would be significantly less. While temperature changes vary both in size and direction from one location to another, the numbers from different locations are combined to produce an estimate of a global average change.\nRecords of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures. A temperature anomaly is measured against a reference value (also called baseline period or long-term average).[9] For example, a commonly used baseline period is 1951-1980. Therefore, if the average temperature for that time period was 15 \u00b0C, and the currently measured temperature is 17 \u00b0C, then the temperature anomaly is +2 \u00b0C.\nTemperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances (of the order of 1000 km).[10] In other words, anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances. By comparison, absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances. A dataset based on anomalies will also be less sensitive to changes in the observing network (such as a new station opening in a particularly hot or cold location) than one based on absolute values will be.\nThe Earth's average surface absolute temperature for the 1961\u20131990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land, oceans and sea ice regions, with a best estimate of 14 \u00b0C (57.2 \u00b0F).[11] The estimate is uncertain, but probably lies within 0.5 \u00b0C of the true value.[11] Given the difference in uncertainties between this absolute value and any annual anomaly, it's not valid to add them together to imply a precise absolute value for a specific year.[12]\nThe global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature, show a warming of 1.09 \u00b0C (range: 0.95 to 1.20 \u00b0C) from 1850\u20131900 to 2011\u20132020, based on multiple independently produced datasets.[5]: 5 The trend is faster since 1970s than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years.[5]: 8\nMost of the observed warming occurred in two periods: around 1900 to around 1940 and around 1970 onwards;[15] the cooling/plateau from 1940 to 1970 has been mostly attributed to sulphate aerosol.[16][17]: 207 Some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns.[18]\nLand air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures. Land temperatures have warmed by 1.59 \u00b0C (range: 1.34 to 1.83 \u00b0C) from 1850\u20131900 to 2011\u20132020, while sea surface temperatures have warmed by 0.88 \u00b0C (range: 0.68 to 1.01 \u00b0C) over the same period.[5]: 5\nFor 1980 to 2020, the linear warming trend for combined land and sea temperatures has been 0.18 \u00b0C to 0.20 \u00b0C per decade, depending on the data set used.[19]: Table 2.4\nIt is unlikely that any uncorrected effects from urbanisation, or changes in land use or land cover, have raised global land temperature changes by more than 10%.[20]: 189 However, larger urbanisation signals have been found locally in some rapidly urbanising regions, such as eastern China.[19]: Section 2.3.1.1.3\nIn recent decades, new high temperature records have substantially outpaced new low temperature records on a growing portion of Earth's surface.[21] Comparison shows seasonal variability for record increases.\nThe warmest years in the instrumental temperature record have occurred in the last decade (i.e. 2012-2021). The World Meteorological Organization reported in March 2021 that 2016 and 2020 were the two warmest years in the period since 1850.[22]\nEach individual year from 2015 onwards has been warmer than any year prior to 1850.[22] In other words: each of the seven years in 2015-2021 was clearly warmer than any pre-2014 year.\nThere is a long-term warming trend, and there is variability about this trend because of natural sources of variability (e.g. ENSO such as 2014\u20132016 El Ni\u00f1o event, volcanic eruption).[23] Not every year will set a record but record highs are occurring regularly.\nWhile record-breaking years can attract considerable public interest,[24] individual years are less significant than the overall trend.[25][26] Some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to \"warmest year\" statistics.[27][25]\nBased on the NOAA dataset (note that other datasets produce different rankings[28]), the following table lists the global combined land and ocean annually averaged temperature rank and anomaly for each of the 10 warmest years on record.[29] For comparison: IPCC uses the mean of four different datasets and expresses the data relative to 1850\u20131900.[citation needed] Although global instrumental temperature records begin only in 1850, reconstructions of earlier temperatures based on climate proxies, suggest these recent years may be the warmest for several centuries to millennia, or longer.[19]: 2\u20136\nGlobal warming by decade: In the last four decades, global average surface temperatures during a given decade have almost always been higher than the average temperature in the preceding decade (data for 1850 to 2020 based on HadCRUT datasets).\nNumerous drivers have been found to influence annual global mean temperatures. An examination of the average global temperature changes by decades reveals continuing climate change: each of the last four decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The most recent decade (2011-2020) was warmer than any multi-centennial period in the past 11,700 years.[19]: 2\u20136\nThe following chart is from NASA data of combined land-surface air and sea-surface water temperature anomalies.[30]\nCombined land-surface air and sea-surface water temperature anomalies (data from NASA)\nColored bars show how El Ni\u00f1o years (red, regional warming) and La Ni\u00f1a years (blue, regional cooling) relate to overall global warming. The El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation has been linked to variability in longer-term global average temperature increase.\nEl Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO): El Ni\u00f1o generally tends to increase global temperatures. La Ni\u00f1a, on the other hand, usually causes years which are cooler than the short-term average.[31] El Ni\u00f1o is the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and La Ni\u00f1a the cold phase. In the absence of other short-term influences such as volcanic eruptions, strong El Ni\u00f1o years are typically 0.1 \u00b0C to 0.2 \u00b0C warmer than the years immediately preceding and following them, and strong La Ni\u00f1a years 0.1 \u00b0C to 0.2 \u00b0C cooler. The signal is most prominent in the year in which the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a ends.[citation needed]\nAerosols and volcanic eruptions: Aerosols diffuse incoming radiation generally cooling the planet. On a long-term basis, aerosols are primarily of anthropogenic origin, but major volcanic eruptions can produce quantities of aerosols which exceed those from anthropogenic sources over periods of time up to a few years. Volcanic eruptions which are sufficiently large to inject significant quantities of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere can have a significant global cooling effect for one to three years after the eruption. This effect is most prominent for tropical volcanoes as the resultant aerosols can spread over both hemispheres. The largest eruptions of the last 100 years, such as the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and Mount Agung eruption in 1963-1964, have been followed by years with global mean temperatures 0.1 \u00b0C to 0.2 \u00b0C below long-term trends at the time.[citation needed]\nThis graph shows how short-term variations occur in the global temperature record. The graph also shows a long-term trend of global warming. Image source: NCADAC.[33]\nThe U.S. National Academy of Sciences, both in its 2002 report to President George W. Bush, and in later publications, has strongly endorsed evidence of an average global temperature increase in the 20th century.[34]\nThe preliminary results of an assessment carried out by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group and made public in October 2011, found that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911 \u00b0C, and their results mirrors those obtained from earlier studies carried out by the NOAA, the Hadley Centre and NASA's GISS. The study addressed concerns raised by \"skeptics\"[35][36] including urban heat island effect, \"poor\"[35] station quality, and the \"issue of data selection bias\"[35] and found that these effects did not bias the results obtained from these earlier studies.[35][37][38][39]\nThe Berkeley Earth dataset has subsequently been made operational and is now one of the datasets used by IPCC and WMO in their assessments.\nOne of the issues that has been raised in the media is the view that global warming \"stopped in 1998\".[43][44]\nThis view ignores the presence of internal climate variability.[44][45] Internal climate variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean.[46] An example of internal climate variability is the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO).[44][45] The El Ni\u00f1o in 1998 was particularly strong, possibly one of the strongest of the 20th century, and 1998 was at the time the world's warmest year on record by a substantial margin.\nCooling over the 2007 to 2012 period, for instance, was likely driven by internal modes of climate variability such as La Ni\u00f1a.[47] The area of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures that defines La Ni\u00f1a conditions can push global temperatures downward, if the phenomenon is strong enough.[47] The slowdown in global warming rates over the 1998 to 2012 period is also less pronounced in current generations of observational datasets than in those available at the time in 2012. The temporary slowing of warming rates ended after 2012, with every year from 2015 onwards warmer than any year prior to 2015, but it is expected that warming rates will continue to fluctuate on decadal timescales through the 21st century.[48]: Box 3.1\nThe most recent climate model simulations give a range of results for changes in global-average temperature. Some models show more warming in the troposphere than at the surface, while a slightly smaller number of simulations show the opposite behaviour. There is no fundamental inconsistency among these model results and observations at the global scale.[49]\nThe satellite records used to show much smaller warming trends for the troposphere which were considered to disagree with model prediction; however, following revisions to the satellite records, the trends are now similar.\nThe U.S. National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program has established minimum standards regarding the instrumentation, siting, and reporting of surface temperature stations.[50] The observing systems available are able to detect year-to-year temperature variations such as those caused by El Ni\u00f1o or volcanic eruptions.[51]\nAnother study concluded in 2006, that existing empirical techniques for validating the local and regional consistency of temperature data are adequate to identify and remove biases from station records, and that such corrections allow information about long-term trends to be preserved.[52] A study in 2013 also found that urban bias can be accounted for, and when all available station data is divided into rural and urban, that both temperature sets are broadly consistent.[53]\nEach of the seven years in 2015-2021 was clearly warmer than any pre-2014 year, and this trend is expected to be true for some time to come (that is, the 2016 record will be broken before 2026 etc.).[citation needed] A decadal forecast by the World Meteorological Organisation issued in 2021 stated a probability of 40% of having a year above 1.5 C in the 2021-2025 period.[citation needed]\nThe changes in climate are not expected to be uniform across the Earth. In particular, land areas change more quickly than oceans, and northern high latitudes change more quickly than the tropics. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting ice, changing the hydrological cycle (of evaporation and precipitation) and changing currents in the oceans.\n^ ab\"What Are \"Proxy\" Data?\".

        "context": "\nThe contest starts with the qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over the course of about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify for the group stage of the tournament. The next FIFA World Cup is scheduled to expand to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament.\nAs of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 22 final tournaments have been held since the event's inception in 1930, and a total of 80 national teams have competed. The trophy has been won by eight national teams. Brazil, with five wins, are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, with three titles; France and inaugural winner Uruguay, each with two titles; and England and Spain, with one title each.\nThe World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world.[1][2] The viewership of the 2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57 billion, close to half of the global population,[3][4] while the engagement with the 2022 World Cup was estimated to be 5 billion, with about 1.5 billion people watching the final match.[5]\nSeventeen countries have hosted the World Cup, most recently Qatar, who hosted the 2022 event. The 2026 tournament will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.\nAfter FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been unsuccessful.[9]\nWith the Olympic event continuing to be a contest between amateur teams only, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup,[11] and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.[12] Prior to the Lipton competition, from 1876 to 1904, games that were considered to be the \"football world championship\" were meetings between leading English and Scottish clubs, such as the 1895 game between Sunderland A.F.C. and the Heart of Midlothian F.C., which Sunderland won.[13]\nIn 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a \"world football championship for amateurs\", and took responsibility for managing the event.[14] This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition for nations, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium.[15]Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era, and is the reason why Uruguay is allowed to wear 4 stars.[16][17]\nDue to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with PresidentJules Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship.[18] With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.[19]\nThe national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides, especially in the midst of the Great Depression. As such, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip.[19] In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America.[20]\nThe first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4\u20131 and Belgium 3\u20130 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France.[21] In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4\u20132 in front of 93,000 spectators in Montevideo, and became the first nation to win the World Cup.[22] After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players; football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics.[23][24] After the IOC and FIFA worked out their differences, Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.[23]\nThe issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 World Cup and all North and South American nations except Brazil and Cuba boycotted the 1938 tournament. Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which Germany and Brazil sought to host,[25] were cancelled due to World War II.[26]\nThe 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to include British football associations. Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland had withdrawn from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football.[27] The teams rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.[28] The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called \"Maracanazo\" (Portuguese: Maracana\u00e7o).[29]\nIn the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.[30] Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: United States, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.\nThe tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 1982,[31] and then to 32 in 1998,[32] allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014; and Morocco, finishing in fourth place in 2022. European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.\nIn October 2013, Sepp Blatter spoke of guaranteeing the Caribbean Football Union's region a position in the World Cup.[34] In the edition of 25 October 2013 of the FIFA Weekly Blatter wrote that: \"From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup. It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup.\"[35] Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.[36]\nFollowing the magazine's publication, Blatter's would-be opponent for the FIFA Presidency, UEFA President Michel Platini, responded that he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to UEFA, two each to the Asian Football Confederation and the Confederation of African Football, two shared between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and a guaranteed place for the Oceania Football Confederation.[37] Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: \"[The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup ... but it's a good compromise. ... It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve.\"[37]\nIn October 2016, FIFA president Gianni Infantino stated his support for a 48-team World Cup in 2026.[38] On 10 January 2017, FIFA confirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist teams.[39]\nBy May 2015, the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games,[40] with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on 29 May and 3 December.[41] By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.[42]\nOn 4 June 2015, Chuck Blazer while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of FIFA's then-executive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 World Cups.[43] On 10 June 2015, Swiss authorities seized computer data from the offices of Sepp Blatter.[44] The same day, FIFA postponed the bidding process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in light of the allegations surrounding bribery in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Then-secretary general J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke stated, \"Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being.\"[45] On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential candidate for presidency, were suspended for 90 days; both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media.[46]\nOn 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May.[47] An additional 16 indictments by the US Department of Justice were announced on the same day.[48]\nA biennial World Cup plan was first proposed by the Saudi Arabian Football Federation at the 71st FIFA Congress on 21 May 2021 and prominently backed by former Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and national federations in Africa and Asia.[49]\nContinental confederations such as UEFA and CONMEBOL are not on board with the plan[50][51] but, in total, the idea is supported by 166 of the 210 member associations of FIFA.[52]\nAn equivalent tournament for women's football, the FIFA Women's World Cup, was first held in 1991 in China.[53] The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.[54]\nThe FIFA Confederations Cup was a tournament held one year before the World Cup at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country.[56] The first edition took place in 1992 and the last edition was played in 2017. In March 2019, FIFA confirmed that the tournament would no longer be active owing to an expansion of the FIFA Club World Cup in 2021.[57]\nThe FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup is held biannually, including the year before each Women's World Cup. Both tournaments were awarded in a single bidding process on three occasions, with the U-20 tournament serving as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition each time (2010, 2014 and 2018).[59]\nFrom 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.[60]\nThe current trophy (held by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in 2018) was designed by Italian Silvio Gazzaniga and first awarded in 1974\nAfter 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36 cm (14.2 in) high, made of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs 6.175 kg (13.6 lb).[61]\nThe base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974.[61] The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: \"The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.\"[62]\nThis new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.[63]\nAll members (players, coaches, and managers) of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the World Cup Trophy; winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the 2002 edition, fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts South Korea. Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.[64][65][66]\nSince 2006, winners of the competition are also awarded the right to wear the FIFA Champions Badge, up until the time at which the winner of the next competition is decided.[67]\nSince the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament.[68] They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, and Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.\nThe qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup.[69] From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.[70]\nThe final tournament format since 1998 has had 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nations. There are two stages: the group stage, followed by the knockout stage.[71]\nIn the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups.[72] The other teams are assigned to different \"pots\", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.[73]\nEach group plays a round-robin tournament in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams.[74] The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).\nConsidering all possible outcomes (win, draw, loss) for all six matches in a group, there are 729 (= 36) combinations possible. However, 207 of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined by:[75]\nGreatest combined goal difference in all group matches\nGreatest combined number of goals scored in all group matches\nIf more than one team remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined as follows:\nGreatest number of points in head-to-head matches among those teams\nGreatest goal difference in head-to-head matches among those teams\nGreatest number of goals scored in head-to-head matches among those teams\nFair play points, defined by the number of yellow and red cards received in the group stage:\nYellow card: minus 1 point\nIndirect red card (as a result of a second yellow card): minus 3 points\nDirect red card: minus 4 points\nYellow card and direct red card: minus 5 points\nIf any of the teams above remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined by the drawing of lots\nThe knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.[71]\nOn 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup (to accommodate more teams), which was to consist of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026.[76] On 14 March 2023, FIFA approved a revised format of the 2026 tournament, which features 12 groups of four teams each, with the top 8 third-placed teams joining the group winners and runners-up in a new round of 32.[77][78]\nEarly World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing.[79] The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.[80]\nSince the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the first tournament with multiple hosts.[81] South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in 2010. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since Argentina 1978,[82] and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe.[83]\nThe host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under an exhaustive ballot system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a \"Hosting Agreement\" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. There have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament.[84][85]\nFor the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament was rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation did not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018.[86] This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.[87]\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup was chosen to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, marking the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations.[88] The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held, with 48 teams playing 104 matches. Sixty matches will take place in the US, including all matches from the quarter-finals onward, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 games each.[88]\nTotal of World Cup competitions hosted by each confederation (1930\u20132026) Confederation and year in bold has an upcoming competition.\nSix of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exceptions being Brazil, who finished as runners-up after losing the deciding match on home soil in 1950 and lost their semi-final against Germany in 2014, and Spain, which reached the second round on home soil in 1982. England (1966) won its only title while playing as a host nation. Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), Argentina (1978), and France (1998) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while Germany (1974) won their second title on home soil.[89][90]\nOther nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. Switzerland (quarter-finals 1954), Sweden (runners-up in 1958), Chile (third place in 1962), South Korea (fourth place in 2002), Russia (quarter-finals 2018), and Mexico (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best results when serving as hosts.[90][91] So far, South Africa (2010) and Qatar (2022) failed to advance beyond the first round.[92][93]\n\u2021 The best-attended single match has been the final in 11 of the 21 World Cups as of 2018[update]. Another match or matches drew more attendance than the final in 1930, 1938, 1958, 1962, 1970\u20131982, 1990, and 2006.\nA Coca-Cola bottle promoting the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan\nThe World Cup was first televised in 1954 and as of 2006[update] is the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion.[1] 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of the tournament, almost a ninth of the entire population of the planet. The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers.[96] The World Cup attracts major sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event.\nThe governing body of the sport, FIFA, generated $4.8 billion in revenue from the 2014 tournament,[97] and $6.1 billion from the 2018 tournament.[98]\nForming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, Panini published its first sticker album for the 1970 World Cup.[104] Since then, collecting and trading stickers and cards has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation.[105] FIFA has licensed World Cup video games since 1986, sponsored by Electronic Arts.[104]\n^There was no third place match in 1930; the two losing semi-finalists are ranked according to their overall records in the tournament.[106]\n^ abThe final stage in 1950 was a round-robin group of four teams. Coincidentally, one of the last two matches pitted together the top two teams (and the only two who could win the title), and the other was between the bottom two teams. Uruguay v Brazil is often considered the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.[107][108]\nIn all, 80 nations have played in at least one World Cup.[109] Of these, eight national teams have won the World Cup, and they have added stars to their badges, with each star representing a World Cup victory. (Uruguay, however, choose to display four stars on their badge, representing their two gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, which are recognised by FIFA as World Championships, and their two World Cup titles in 1930 and 1950).\nWith five titles, Brazil are the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have played in every World Cup (22) to date.[110] Brazil were also the first team to win the World Cup for the third (1970), fourth (1994) and fifth (2002) time. Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. West Germany (1982\u20131990) and Brazil (1994\u20132002) are the only nations to appear in three consecutive World Cup finals. Germany has made the most top-four finishes (13), medals (12), as well as the most finals (8).\nSouth Koreans watching their nation on the big screens in Seoul Plaza during the 2002 World Cup when they became the first Asian country to reach the semi-finals\nTo date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by teams from the UEFA (Europe) and CONMEBOL (South America) confederations. European nations have won twelve titles, while South American nations have won ten. Only three teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: United States (North, Central America and Caribbean) in 1930; South Korea (Asia) in 2002; and Morocco (Africa) in 2022. Only one Oceanian qualifier, Australia in 2006, has advanced to the second round, a feat they later reaccomplished in 2022.[a]\nBrazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the only teams to win a World Cup hosted outside their continental confederation; Brazil came out victorious in Europe (1958), North America (1970 and 1994) and Asia (2002). Argentina won a World Cup in North America in 1986 and in Asia in 2022. Spain won in Africa in 2010. In 2014, Germany became the first European team to win in the Americas. Only on five occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent; the longest streak of tournaments won by a single confederation is four, with the 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018 tournaments all won by UEFA teams (Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, respectively).\nBrazil's M\u00e1rio Zagallo, West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer and France's Didier Deschamps are the only people to date to win the World Cup as both player and head coach. Zagallo won in 1958 and 1962 as a player and in 1970 as head coach.[119] Beckenbauer won in 1974 as captain and in 1990 as head coach,[120] and Deschamps repeated the feat in 2018, after having won in 1998 as captain.[121]Italy's Vittorio Pozzo is the only head coach to ever win two World Cups (1934 and 1938).[122] All World Cup-winning head coaches were natives of the country they coached to victory.[123]\nAmong the national teams, Brazil has played the most World Cup matches (114), Germany appeared in the most finals (8), semi-finals (13), and quarter-finals (16), while Brazil has appeared in the most World Cups (22), has the most wins (76) and has scored the most goals (237).[124][125] The two teams have played each other twice in the World Cup, in the 2002 final and in the 2014 semi-final.[126]\nAt the end of each World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament.\nThere are five post-tournament awards from the FIFA Technical Study Group:[127][128]\nDiego Maradona (holding the World Cup) received the Golden Ball for best player at the 1986 World Cup.\nthe Golden Ball (named for its sponsor \"Adidas Golden Ball\") for best player, first awarded in 1982;\nthe Golden Boot (named for its sponsor \"Adidas Golden Boot\", formerly known as the \"adidas Golden Shoe\" from 1982 to 2006) for top goalscorer, first awarded in 1982;\nthe Golden Glove (named for its sponsor \"Adidas Golden Glove\", formerly known as the \"Lev Yashin Award\" from 1994 to 2006) for best goalkeeper, first awarded in 1994;\nthe FIFA Young Player Award (formerly known as the \"Best Young Player Award\" from 2006 to 2010) for best player under 21 years of age at the start of the calendar year, first awarded in 2006;\nthe FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team that advanced to the second round with the best record of fair play, first awarded in 1970.\nThere is currently one award voted on by fans during the tournament.:\nthe Player of the Match (currently commercially termed \"Budweiser Player of the Match\", formerly known as the \"Man of the Match\" from 2002 to 2018) for outstanding performance during each match of the tournament, first awarded in 2002.\nThere are two awards voted on by fans after the conclusion of the tournament:\nthe Goal of the Tournament, (currently commercially termed \"Hyundai Goal of the Tournament\") for the fans' best goal scored during the tournament, first awarded in 2006;\nthe Most Entertaining Team during the World Cup final tournament, as determined by a poll of the general public.\nan All-Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen by the FIFA Technical Study Group. From 2010 onwards, all Dream Teams or Statistical Teams are unofficial, as reported by FIFA itself.\n^Australia's qualification in 2006 was through the Oceanian zone as they were a member of the OFC member during qualifying. However, on 1 January 2006, they left the Oceania Football Confederation and joined the Asian Football Confederation. In 2022, they again reached the second round, albeit representing Asia.\n^ abStephen Dobson and John Goddard, The Economics of Football, page 407, quote \"The World Cup is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world: the estimated cumulative television audience for the 2006 World Cup in Germany was 26.2 billion, an average of 409 million viewers per match.\"\n^Glenn M. Wong, The Comprehensive Guide to Careers in Sports, page 144, quote \"The World Cup is the most-watched sporting event in the world. In 2006, more than 30 billion viewers in 214 countries watched the World Cup on television, and more than 3.3 million spectators attended the 64 matches of the tournament.\"\n^Previously, due to there being fewer finals places and a bigger ratio of European finalists, there had been several occasions where three European teams were in a single group, for example, 1986 (West Germany, Scotland, and Denmark), 1990 (Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Austria), and 1994 (Italy, Republic of Ireland, and Norway).

        "context": "\nThe FIFA Women's World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the senior women's national teams of the members of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's international governing body. The competition has been held every four years and one year after the men's FIFA World Cup since 1991, when the inaugural tournament, then called the FIFA Women's World Championship, was held in China. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 31 slots in a three-year qualification phase. The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 32nd slot. The tournament, called the World Cup Finals, is contested at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about one month.\nThe nine FIFA Women's World Cup tournaments have been won by five national teams. The United States have won four times. The other winners are Germany, with two titles, and Japan, Norway, and Spain with one title each.\nEight countries have hosted the Women's World Cup. China and the United States have each hosted the tournament twice, while Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, and Sweden have each hosted it once.\nThe 2023 competition was hosted by Australia and New Zealand, making it the first edition to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, the first Women's World Cup to be hosted by two countries, as well as the first FIFA competition for either men or women to be held across two confederations.\nQualifying tournaments are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, Europe), and are organised by their respective confederations: Confederation of African Football (CAF), Asian Football Confederation (AFC), Confederation of North, Central America, and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). For each tournament, FIFA decides beforehand the number of berths awarded to each of the continental zones, based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams. The hosts of the World Cup receive an automatic berth in the finals. With the exception of the UEFA, other confederations organise its qualification campaign throughout continental tournaments. Since the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, the number of finalists increased from 16 to 24 and now 32.[1]\nThe final tournament has featured between 12 and 32 national teams competing over about one month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.[2]\nIn the group stage, teams are drawn into groups of four teams each. Each group plays a round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams. In the 2015 24-team format, the two teams finishing first and second in each group and the four best teams among those ranked third qualified for the round of 16, also called the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).\nSeveral countries lifted bans on women's football in the 1970s, leading to new teams being established in many countries. After official continental women's tournaments were held in Asia in 1975[8] and Europe in 1984, Ellen Wille declared that she wanted better effort from the FIFA Congress in promoting the women's game.[9] This came in the form of the 1988 FIFA Women's Invitation Tournament in China as a test to see if a global women's World Cup was feasible. Twelve national teams took part in the competition \u2013 four from UEFA, three from AFC, two from CONCACAF, one each from CONMEBOL, CAF and OFC. After the opening match of the tournament between China and Canada was attended by 45,000 people, the tournament was deemed a success, with crowds averaging 20,000. Norway, who were the European champions, defeated Sweden, 1\u20130, in the final, while Brazil clinched third place by beating the hosts in a penalty shootout.[10] The competition was deemed a success and on 30 June FIFA approved the establishment of an official World Cup, which was to take place in 1991 again in China. Again, twelve teams competed, this time culminating in the United States defeating Norway in the final, 2\u20131, with Michelle Akers scoring two goals.[11]\nThe 1995 edition in Sweden saw the experiment of a time-out concept throughout the tournament which was later tightened mid-tournament to only occur after a break in play. The time-out only appeared in the one tournament which saw it scrapped. The final of the 1995 edition saw Norway, who scored 17 goals in the group stage, defeat Germany, 2\u20130, to capture their only title.[12]\nIn the 1999 edition, one of the most famous moments of the tournament was American defender Brandi Chastain's victory celebration after scoring the Cup-winning penalty kick against China. She took off her jersey and waved it over her head (as men frequently do) as she celebrated. The 1999 final in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, had an attendance of 90,185.[13]\nIn the 2019 edition, which was held in France, the United States won the tournament for the fourth time.\nIn 2023, Australia and New Zealand hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup for the first time as joint hosts, and the number of participants was expanded from 24 to 32. It was also the first tournament to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. With Australia and New Zealand respectively being members of the Asian Football Confederation and Oceania Football Confederation, this was the first FIFA senior competition to be hosted across two confederations. Spain won their first ever title, defeating England 1-0 in the final. This made Spain the 2nd nation to win both Men's and Women's World Cup, after Germany.\nThe current trophy was designed in 1998 for the 1999 tournament, and takes the form of a spiral band, enclosing a football at the top, that aims to capture the athleticism, dynamism, and elegance of international women's football. In the 2010s, it was fitted with a cone-shaped base. Underneath the base, the name of each of the tournament's previous winners is engraved.[19] The trophy is 47 cm (19 in) tall, weighs 4.6 kg (10 lb) and is made of sterling silver clad in 23-karat yellow and white gold, with an estimated value in 2015 of approximately $30,000. By contrast, the men's World Cup trophy is fabricated in 18-karat gold and has a precious metal value of $150,000. However, a new Winner's Trophy is constructed for each women's champion to take home, while there is only one original men's trophy which is retained by FIFA with each men's champion taking home a replica trophy.[20]\nSince 2007, the winners are also awarded the FIFA Champions Badge, which is worn on the jerseys of the winning team until the winners of the next tournament has been decided.[21]\nThe 2003 Women's World Cup was initially planned to be hosted by China, with FIFA awarding the hosting rights in October 2000. Following a SARS outbreak, it was re-awarded to the United States in May 2003.[24]\n^The 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup was held in the United States following a SARSoutbreak in China, where it was initially planned to be held.\nIn total, 44 nations have played in at least one Women's World Cup. Of those, five nations have won the World Cup. With four titles, the United States is the most successful Women's World Cup team; it is one of only seven nations to play in every World Cup. They have also had the most top four finishes (8), medals (8), as well as final appearances (5), including the longest streak of three consecutive finals in 2011, 2015, and 2019.\nAs of 2023[update], four of the six FIFA confederations have made it to a Women's World Cup final, the only exceptions being CAF (Africa) and the OFC (Oceania). CONMEBOL is the only confederation to have made a World Cup final without winning, following Brazil's defeat in the 2007 final. The farthest advancing African team was Nigeria, who were eliminated in the quarter finals in 1999. Oceania has sent two teams, Australia and New Zealand, to the World Cup, but Australia did not advance from the group stage until after the country's football association moved to the Asian Football Confederation, and New Zealand (which remains in the OFC) has never advanced to the knockout rounds.\nThe United States and Norway are the only teams to have won the tournament in their own confederations, with the U.S. winning in 1999 (at home) and 2015 (in Canada), and Norway in 1995 (in Sweden).\nThe 2015 Women's World Cup generated almost $73 million.[29] By comparison, that equates to 1% of the revenue generated by the 2018 men's tournament of $6.1 billion.[30][31]\nIn 2023, FIFA separated broadcast rights for the Women's World Cup from the men's tournament for the first time, and president Gianni Infantino suggested in May 2023 that the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup might not be broadcast in the \"Big 5\" European countries due to disappointing offers.[32][33] As of 3 June 2023[update], FIFA had yet to reach broadcast agreements in Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, or the United Kingdom, with German broadcasters ZDF and ARD bidding 3% as much for the Women's World Cup as the 2022 men's World Cup, French and Spanish broadcasters less than 5%, and Italian broadcasters less than 1%.[33]",

        "context": "\nDi Mar\u00eda was born on 14 February 1988 in Rosario, Santa Fe, as one of three children of Miguel di Mar\u00eda and Diana Hernandez, and grew up in Perdriel. As an infant, he was unusually active, and on recommendation of a doctor was signed up for football at age three. He also helped his parents with their work at a local coal yard along with his two sisters, Vanesa and Evelyn. Due to the low income his family earned, purchasing football boots and keeping up with Di Mar\u00eda's hobby was difficult for his parents. He considers himself to be a \"family man\" and has used a significant amount of his salary to \"give back\" to his family.[12] After being transferred to Benfica, he asked his father not to work any more and purchased a house for his parents and sisters.[13]\nDi Mar\u00eda was transferred to the Portuguese side Benfica in July 2007, where he played as a winger. He was signed as a replacement for Benfica's departing captain, Sim\u00e3o, who joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid earlier that summer.[16] Benfica paid Rosario Central \u20ac6 million for 80% of his sports rights and 50% of sports rights of Andr\u00e9s D\u00edaz.[18] Later, in August 2008, the Portuguese club paid an extra \u20ac2 million for the remaining 20%,[19] but re-sold 10% to GestiFute.[20] Di Mar\u00eda was signed by the Portuguese club with the intention of replacing Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa, who had just left the club to play for Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid.\nDi Mar\u00eda had his breakthrough in the 2009\u201310 season thanks to the trust placed in him by manager Jorge Jesus. On 22 October, in the Europa League group stage match against Everton, he provided an hat-trick of assist for the first time in his career, in a 5\u20130 thrashing at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz, marking the biggest loss of an English side in a European competition.[21][22] During that month, Di Mar\u00eda signed a new deal with Benfica, adding three more years to his current deal, which was to last until 30 June 2015 with his release fee set at a minimum of \u20ac40 million.[23] Afterwards, he was backed by Diego Maradona to become \"Argentina's next superstar\".[24] He would score a brace in Benfica's 2\u20131 home win over AEK Athens, to ensure Benfica's qualification to the round of thirty-two, as group winners.[25] On 27 February 2010, Di Mar\u00eda scored his first hat-trick in a classic 4\u20130 win against Leix\u00f5es. The next day, he made the headlines as \"Magic Tri Mar\u00eda\" in all sports newspapers in Portugal.[26] He finished as the league's top assister that season with 11 assists, including two in a 5\u20130 against Olhanense, as Benfica won the national championship, adding the year's domestic League Cup, while being named Player of the Month in April.[27]\nOn 28 June 2010, Real Madrid posted on their website that they had agreed with Benfica for the transfer of Di Mar\u00eda. He signed a five-year contract for \u20ac25 million, plus \u20ac11 million in incentives, as announced one day later by the Portuguese Stock Exchange regulating entity.[28] On 7 July 2010, Di Mar\u00eda arrived to Madrid directly from Buenos Aires,[29] and passed the medical test on 8 July.[30]\nHe made his debut on 4 August 2010 in a friendly match against Mexican side Am\u00e9rica, which Real Madrid won 3\u20132.[31] On 22 August, Di Mar\u00eda scored his first goal in another friendly away against H\u00e9rcules, which Real Madrid won 1\u20133.[32] In the last match of the pre-season, on 24 August, after an individual play described as a \"magic moment\", he opened the score of the 2\u20130 win against Pe\u00f1arol for the Trofeo Santiago Bernab\u00e9u.[33]\nDi Mar\u00eda scored Real Madrid's third goal during their first-leg Champions League quarter-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 April 2011.[38] On 20 April, he was sent off in the 31st minute of extra time in the Copa del Rey final against rival Barcelona. Real Madrid won the match 1\u20130, the lone goal of the match (in the 13th minute of extra time) being a header from Cristiano Ronaldo, which came from his cross, thus obtaining his first honour with Real Madrid.[39]\nDuring the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Di Mar\u00eda endured a tough series of matches as he struggled to adapt to the pace of the league following the summer break. As a result, Di Mar\u00eda's early performance for the season was mixed with moments of genuinely good play interspersed with moments of sheer madness by the Argentine. This point was well illustrated during Real Madrid's 1\u20130 defeat to Levante, a match which saw a clearly out-of-sorts Di Mar\u00eda commit a horror foul on Levante's Juanfran during the match. Di Mar\u00eda caused the two teams to clash and an on-field incident ensued. However, Di Mar\u00eda's performances would improve, including opening up a significant gap at the top of the assists table. From October 2011, Di Mar\u00eda was being picked by Madrid head coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ahead of Kak\u00e1 and Mesut \u00d6zil, a sign of his improving form.[citation needed]\nOn 27 November 2011, Di Mar\u00eda played 60 minutes in a league match against city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, in which he scored a goal for Real Madrid. Mourinho's team won the match 4\u20131. On 3 December 2011, Di Mar\u00eda scored Real's first goal from a sharp angle in a 3\u20130 defeat of Sporting de Gij\u00f3n in La Liga.[40] He was a constant threat and presence in the starting XI as Real Madrid won their 32nd league title, playing in their 3\u20130 win over Athletic Bilbao that clinched the league title.[41]\nAlthough Di Mar\u00eda did not have the best season, he did contribute in big moments, most notably by sending in the cross for Cristiano Ronaldo's goal against Manchester United on 13 February,[43] he registered seventeen assists, and scored nine goals throughout the season in 52 appearances, notably against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and M\u00e1laga. On 9 August 2012, Di Mar\u00eda signed a new contract with Real Madrid, keeping him at the club until 2018.[44]\nOn 2 October 2013, Di Mar\u00eda scored two goals against Copenhagen in Real Madrid's 4\u20130 Champions League victory over them.[citation needed] Later in the season, due to tactical decisions by the club's new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Di Mar\u00eda's playing position was permanently switched to that of an offensive\u2013minded central midfielder, and he was frequently deployed in the starting line-up alongside Luka Modri\u0107 and Xabi Alonso in midfield in the team's 4\u20133\u20133 formation.[45] He contributed to the club's 1\u20132 victory over Barcelona in the 2014 Copa del Rey Final with the opening goal.[46] Di Mar\u00eda was the top assist maker in La Liga for the season, contributing 17.[47]\nDi Mar\u00eda was an unused substitute as Real Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla on 12 August.[50] A week later, in the first leg of the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, he played the final 15 minutes of a 1\u20131 home draw against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in place of Luka Modri\u0107.[51][52]\nDi Mar\u00eda made his debut on 30 August in a 0\u20130 draw with Burnley, in which he was substituted for Anderson after 70 minutes.[58] He scored his first goal for United on 14 September, netting directly from a free-kick in a 4\u20130 win over Queens Park Rangers.[59][60] He also provided an assist for Juan Mata's goal in the same match, winning the vote for Man of the Match.[59] His performance was highlighted by Sky Sports' Player Cam feature, which was brought back especially for the match.[61] In the next match, against Leicester City on 21 September, he again scored a goal and provided another assist, although United lost the match 5\u20133.[62]\nOn 2 October, Di Mar\u00eda won Manchester United's Player of the Month award for September after recording two goals and two assists in his first four matches for the club.[63] One week later, he won his second individual trophy at United after his goal against Leicester, in which he chipped goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, was voted as the club's Goal of the Month for September.[64] Di Mar\u00eda continued his run of fine form on 5 October by scoring a goal and providing an assist for Radamel Falcao to help United defeat Everton 2\u20131.[65] Di Mar\u00eda was substituted with a hamstring injury 13 minutes into United's 3\u20130 defeat of Hull City on 29 November and subsequently made only one substitute appearance in the team's next seven matches.\nOn 4 January 2015, Di Mar\u00eda returned from injury to score a late goal in a 0\u20132 win against Yeovil Town in the third round of the FA Cup.[66] A week later, he was used as a forward by manager Louis van Gaal in a 0\u20131 home defeat to Southampton.[67] This new role came in the midst of a bad run of form for Di Mar\u00eda, who was said to have struggled since October.[68] Di Mar\u00eda was sent off on 9 March as United lost 1\u20132 at home against Arsenal in the FA Cup sixth round, being booked for diving and for grabbing the shirt of referee Michael Oliver, but earlier set up the equaliser by Wayne Rooney.[69][70]\nAt the season's end, Di Mar\u00eda was judged by The Daily Telegraph to be the worst signing of the season.[71]\nOn 25 July 2015, Di Mar\u00eda failed to board a flight to the United States to join Manchester United's pre-season tour as scheduled; manager Louis van Gaal said he \"did not know why\".[72] On 2 August, it was reported Di Mar\u00eda would undergo a medical ahead of a move to Paris Saint-Germain;[73] and four days later, Manchester United confirmed he had been sold to the French champions for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around \u00a344 million, signing a four-year contract.[74][75][76][77]\nIn the 2016\u201317 Champions League group stage home match against Basel on 19 October 2016, Di Mar\u00eda scored the opening goal in the 40th minute in a 3\u20130 victory for PSG to register his first goal of the season.[83] On 19 November, he opened the scoring with his first Ligue 1 goal of the season in a 2\u20130 home win against Nantes.\nOn the first leg of his side's Champions league round of 16 tie against his former club Manchester United in the 2018\u201319 season, Di Mar\u00eda sustained a serious injury following a tackle from Ashley Young; however, he refused to be substituted, and in the final moments of the game, he assisted Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's goal for a 0\u20132 win at Old Trafford.[87] Eventually, PSG lost 3\u20131 in the second leg and were eliminated in the round of 16 for the third consecutive season.[88]\nIn the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League group stage, Di Mar\u00eda scored a brace in a 3\u20130 win over his former club Real Madrid on 18 September 2019.[89] On 18 August 2020, Di Mar\u00eda scored a goal and recorded two assists in PSG's 3\u20130 Champions League semi-final victory over RB Leipzig;[90] the club went on to play against Bayern Munich in the final, but lost the match 1\u20130.[91]\nOn 23 September 2020, Di Mar\u00eda was handed a four-match suspension for a spitting incident with \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez during Le Classique 10 days earlier.[92] He would miss the league matches against Angers, N\u00eemes, Dijon and Nantes.[93] In a UEFA Champions League match against RB Leipzig on 4 November, Di Mar\u00eda scored the opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 defeat.[94] He made his return to league action in a match against Rennes three days later, and scored a goal to help PSG win the match 3\u20130.[95]\nIn a home match against \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir on 9 December 2020, Di Mar\u00eda recorded two assists; he subsequently became the player with the third most assists in UEFA Champions League history with a tally of 32, only being behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[96] On 12 March 2021, Di Mar\u00eda extended his contract with Paris Saint-Germain for one more season with an option for a second.[97] On 4 May, Di Mar\u00eda was sent off against Manchester City in the semi-finals of the Champions League for stamping on Fernandinho in an off the ball incident.[98] He was handed a three-match ban in European competitions.[99] In the 2021 Coupe de France Final, when PSG defeated Monaco by a score of 2\u20130, Di Mar\u00eda broke the all-time assist record for PSG by delivering a pass for a Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 goal. It was his 104th assist as a PSG player.[100]\nIn the 2021\u201322 season with Paris Saint-Germain, Di Mar\u00eda won the Ligue 1 title, his fifth league title with the club. On 20 May 2022, his departure from Paris at the end of his contract was confirmed.[101] In his last match for the club against Metz on 21 May, Di Mar\u00eda scored a goal and recorded an assist, helping his team to a 5\u20130 win. He received a tribute and ovation from the Parc des Princes.[102] Di Mar\u00eda ended his spell at PSG with 92 goals and 112 assists in 295 matches.[103]\nOn 23 February 2023, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 away win over Nantes in the Europa League.[110] On 9 March, he scored his fourth goal in the competition, after netting the only goal of an home win over Freiburg.[111] He impressed during the season, despite suffering from multiple hamstring injuries, which limited his game time. On 6 June, Di Mar\u00eda confirmed his departure from Juventus, following the expiry of his contract.[112]\nOn 6 July 2023, Di Mar\u00eda signed a one-year contract with Benfica and was presented in front of 2,500 Benfica supporters in the entrance of Est\u00e1dio da Luz.[113][114] On 9 August, Di Mar\u00eda made his second debut at Benfica, scoring the opening goal of a 2\u20130 victory over Porto in the Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira, winning his first trophy back with the club.[115] With two assists and a goal in a 4\u20130 win over Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es on 2 September, he reached five goal contributions in his first four league games, best in the league.[116]\nOn 28 January 2008, Di Mar\u00eda and some of his under-20s teammates were called up for the Argentina Olympic football team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He scored the extra-time game-winning goal on a pass from Lionel Messi in the 105th minute of his team's 2\u20131 quarter-final win over the Netherlands.[118] On 23 August, Di Mar\u00eda scored the game-winner \u2013 a chip over the goalkeeper from the edge of the area \u2013 in the 57th minute of Argentina's 1\u20130 victory against Nigeria to capture their second-straight Olympic gold medal in the final game of the Olympic tournament.[119]\nOn 19 May 2010, Di Mar\u00eda was selected by Argentinian manager Diego Maradona in the 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On 24 May, Di Mar\u00eda scored his debut international goal in a 5\u20130 friendly win over Canada.[121] At the World Cup, he helped Argentina reach the quarter-finals, playing in all five of Argentina's matches and starting four of them.[122]\nDi Mar\u00eda made 12 appearances during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign[120] and was included in the Argentina national team for the tournament finals.[125] In Argentina's round of 16 match against Switzerland, Di Mar\u00eda scored the only goal of the game after 118 minutes, from a Lionel Messi assist.[126] During the quarter-final match against Belgium, Di Mar\u00eda suffered a muscle tear in the thigh and was later taken off the field. It was later announced after the match that Di Mar\u00eda would miss the rest of the tournament due to the injury.[127] He had previously helped to create Gonzalo Higua\u00edn's only goal of the match, which sent Argentina into the semi-finals. Argentina finished the tournament as runners-up to Germany.[128]\nOn 11 July, Di Mar\u00eda was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[129]\nOn 3 September 2014, in a friendly away against world champions Germany, Di Mar\u00eda had a part in all four of Argentina's goals in a 2\u20134 victory, assisting three and scoring one.[130]\nOn 28 May 2015, Di Mar\u00eda was included in Argentina national team for the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica.[131] On 6 June, he was selected to captain the team in the absence of Lionel Messi for a warm-up match against Bolivia, scoring twice in a 5\u20130 win.[132] A week later, in their opening match of the tournament against Paraguay in La Serena, Di Mar\u00eda won a penalty which Messi scored in a 2\u20132 draw.[133] On 30 June, he scored twice and assisted a goal for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, as Argentina defeated Paraguay 6\u20131 to reach the final.[134] He was substituted with a hamstring injury within the first half-hour of the final against hosts Chile, which his team lost in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw.[135]\nIn Argentina's opening match of the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario on 6 June 2016, a rematch of the previous tournament's final against defending champions Chile, Di Mar\u00eda scored the opening goal of the match and later assisted \u00c9ver Banega's goal in a 2\u20131 win. Di Mar\u00eda dedicated the goal to his grandmother, who had recently died.[136] In his nation's second group match, against Panama on 10 June, he assisted Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi's opening goal, but was later forced off due to injury. Argentina won the match 5\u20130.[137] He missed the rest of the tournament due to injury[138] as Argentina reached the Copa Am\u00e9rica final for the second consecutive time, once again losing out to Chile on penalties, following a 0\u20130 draw.[139]\nIn June 2021, Di Mar\u00eda was included in the Argentina national team for the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[143] On 21 June, he assisted the only goal of the match, scored by Papu G\u00f3mez, in Argentina's third group match against Paraguay; the result allowed his side to progress to the quarter-finals.[144] In the final of the tournament against the hosts Brazil on 10 July, he scored the only goal of the match to give Argentina their joint record 15th Copa Am\u00e9rica title with Uruguay and their first international title since 1993. He ran onto a long pass from Rodrigo De Paul into the Brazilian penalty area. The pass was slightly deflected by Brazilian defender Renan Lodi before Di Mar\u00eda controlled the ball with the outside of his left foot; he then chipped the ball over the goalkeeper Ederson, giving Argentina an early lead. Although he was substituted late in the second half of the match, the goal would hold as the winning effort for Argentina.[145]\nOn 11 November 2022, Di Mar\u00eda was named in the final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[147] On 26 November, he recorded an assist on Messi's opening goal in Argentina's second group match, a 2\u20130 win over Mexico.[148] On 18 December, Di Mar\u00eda scored his team's second goal against France in the final, minutes after winning the penalty for the first goal as Argentina defeated France 4\u20132 on penalties, after the match ended 3\u20133 in extra-time, to win the World Cup.[149] He was surprised by the coach's decision to start him on the left and thought Scaloni was \"confused,\" but Scaloni convinced Di Maria how he wanted to game plan with him specifically on the left.[150]\nDi Mar\u00eda is a quick, strong, tricky and talented winger who is also capable of playing as a more central attacking midfielder or on either side of the pitch, although he is predominantly a left-footed player.[151] He has also been deployed to great effect as a central midfielder, in particular under Carlo Ancelotti's tenure with Real Madrid.[45] Possessing a slender frame,[152] Di Mar\u00eda is an agile, creative and highly technical player who possesses excellent dribbling skills and ball control, as well as great pace, stamina, movement, and acceleration, attributes which allow him to beat players easily in one-on-one situations. He is also gifted with excellent vision, set-piece delivery, passing, and crossing ability, which allow him to function effectively as a playmaker and as an assist provider, although he is also capable of scoring goals himself, and is an accurate free kick taker. Despite not being physically imposing, he is also a very hard-working player, and he improved on the defensive aspect of his game under manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.[153][154][155][156] Considered to be one of the greatest players of his generation and one of the greatest Argentine players of all time,[4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Di Mar\u00eda has also drawn praise in the media over his decisive performances in important matches throughout his career.[157] Despite his ability, however, he has often struggled with injuries throughout his career.[158]\nHe married fellow Argentine Jorgelina (n\u00e9e Cardoso) in 2011.[162] Together they have two daughters, Mia and Pia. Pia was born three months premature and survived after treatment at an intensive care unit at the Hospital Universitario Montepr\u00edncipe in Madrid.[162][163]\nOn 2 September 2020, it was reported that Di Mar\u00eda, along with PSG teammates Neymar and Leandro Paredes, had tested positive for COVID-19. The French sports newspaper L'\u00c9quipe said that the three players reportedly went on vacation in Ibiza. As a result, they had to quarantine for one week, and the rest of the players and working staff were scheduled to take a coronavirus test within the same week.[165][166]\nDuring a match between PSG and Nantes on 14 March 2021, Di Mar\u00eda's home was robbed and his family was held hostage. He had been substituted off the pitch by manager Mauricio Pochettino, who informed Di Mar\u00eda of the situation. PSG teammate Marquinhos' parents' home was also burgled in a similar way.[167]\nDi Mar\u00eda is one of the 13 sports personalities named in the Pandora Papers published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). He used a company in Panama to exploit his image rights for months before arriving at Real Madrid. He is the owner of a company in Panama created especially to manage his million-dollar contracts for the exploitation of his image rights, a shell company that he used since 2009 and that he maintains to this day while playing at Paris Saint-Germain with Lionel Messi. The Pandora Papers reveal that he handled more than 8 million euros between 2013 and 2017 through a company named Sunpex Corporation Inc.[168]",

        "context": "\nWill Smith will not be allowed to attend the Academy Awards for the next 10 years, as a result of his slapping comedian Chris Rock on stage during this year\u2019s Oscar ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences announced in a statement obtained by CNN.\n\u201cThe Board has decided, for a period of 10 years from April 8, 2022, Mr. Smith shall not be permitted to attend any Academy events or programs, in person or virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards,\u201d Academy President David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson said in a statement on Friday.\nThe decision was made during a Board of Governors meeting held earlier in the day in Los Angeles. The meeting, initially scheduled for April 18, was expedited after Smith announced his resignation from the Academy last week.\nSmith issued a quick, concise statement on his ban from the Oscars for the next decade.\n\u201cI accept and respect the Academy\u2019s decision,\u201d the actor said in a statement to CNN.\nCNN has reached out to Rock\u2019s representatives for comment.\ufeff\nThe decision came following \u201ctons of debate\u201d on what the consequences of his on-stage slap should be, a board member tells CNN.\nThe Academy\u2019s letter added: \u201cThe 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year; however, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr. Smith exhibit on stage.\u201d\n\u201cDuring our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room,\u201d the letter went on to state. \u201cFor this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short \u2014 unprepared for the unprecedented.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s resignation means that he is no longer part of the Academy\u2019s voting body, but it does not prevent the Oscar winner from being nominated in the future, a source with knowledge previously told CNN.\nSmith can also still be nominated despite being barred from attending the Oscars because \u201cthe standards of conduct rules\u201d at play in today\u2019s action \u201cdo not apply to awards eligibility,\u201d a source close to the Academy with direct knowledge of the rules told CNN on Friday.\nTypically, the previous year\u2019s best actor winner presents the current year\u2019s best actress award (and the reigning best actress presents to the best actor trophy). With Smith\u2019s ban, the Oscars will have to break that tradition.\nThe actor struck Rock as the comedian was on stage presenting at the Academy Awards on March 27 after Rock had made a joke about Smith\u2019s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s, close-cropped hair.\nDays after it occurred, Rock appeared at a comedy show in Boston as part of his \u201cEgo Death Tour\u201d and said \u201cI don\u2019t have a bunch of s*** about what happened, so if you came to hear that, I had like a whole show I wrote before this weekend.

        "context": "\nMary Elizabeth Truss was born on 26 July 1975 at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England.[1] She was the second child of John and Priscilla Truss (n\u00e9e Grasby); the year prior to Truss's birth, their first son, Matthew, had died.[1][n 2] Truss was known by her middle name, Elizabeth, from early childhood, with her father\u2014a professor of pure mathematics at the University of Leeds\u2014using it regularly, which she preferred;[3] after being given a badge with \"Mary\" on it on her first day of school, Truss asked her teacher that it be changed.[4] She later described her parents' politics as being \"to the left of Labour\";[5] her mother, a teacher and nurse, was a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.[6] When Truss stood for election as a Conservative, her mother agreed to campaign with her but her father declined to do so.[7] Her parents divorced in 2003.[8]\n[S]he stands out in my memory as a sort of strange, unfocused force, hugely in favour of action and change... it was always hard to see the aim of it all, or where it might lead, except that she would be at the center of it.\nIn 1977 Truss and her parents moved to Warsaw, but returned to Britain after John and Priscilla found it \"grim\".[10] After living briefly in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the family moved to Paisley in Scotland when Truss was four years old, where she attended West Primary School.[11] In 1985 they moved south to Leeds, where Truss attended Roundhay School; she later said in 2022 that at the school she \"saw kids... being let down\", a claim which was criticised as inaccurate by several former Roundhay pupils.[12] When Truss was 12 she and her family spent a year in Burnaby, British Columbia, where she attended Parkcrest Elementary School whilst her father taught at Simon Fraser University.[13] Truss praised the Canadian curriculum and the attitude that it was \"really good to be top of the class\", which she contrasted with her education at Roundhay.[14]\nIn January 2005 Sue Catling, the parliamentary candidate for the Calder Valley constituency, was forced to resign by the local Conservative Association because of an affair with the association's chairman.[46] Catling claimed that the members of the party that had opposed her were sexist and said that she was \"accused of everything except murder and paedophilia\".[47] Truss, who was selected as the candidate for the seat, narrowly lost to the Labour incumbent after an active Conservative campaign which The Yorkshire Post described as \"Blitzkrieg\".[48] Beginning in 2004, Truss embarked on an 18-month affair with the Conservative MP Mark Field, which ended shortly after the following year's election.[49]\nFollowing the 2005 general election David CameronreplacedMichael Howard as leader, and Truss was added to the party's A-List, a list of potential Conservative candidates;[43] in October 2009 she was selected for the constituency of South West Norfolk by members of the local Conservative Association, winning over 50 per cent of the vote in the first round of the final against 5 other candidates, including the future deputy prime minister Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey.[50][51] Shortly after her selection, some members of the constituency association objected to Truss's selection because of her failure to declare her affair with Field.[52]The Mail on Sunday was the first to report on the affair, and party members claimed to have been misled over Truss's \"skeleton in the cupboard\".[51] A motion was proposed to terminate Truss's candidature; the proponents of Truss's deselection were branded the \"Turnip Taliban\" by Conservative Party officials and the press, including by the Mail,[53] a reference to stereotypes about Norfolk being a county of farmers.[54] There was also controversy over the fact that Truss was not from Norfolk, with some in the association asking for a local candidate and saying that she had been \"parachuted in\".[55] On 16 November, the motion was put to the association: following both sides making their arguments, including what Cole and Heale call an \"impassioned\" speech from Truss, it was defeated by 132 votes to 37.[56][57]\nOur message must be that the state cannot do everything: while the government can help, it can never fully solve any individual's problems. The NHS can't keep you healthy if you don't eat or exercise properly. A teacher can't get you the grades if you aren\u2019t prepared to work. The job centre can't find you work if you aren\u2019t prepared to write a CV.[67]\nAnother book by the same authors, Britannia Unchained, was published in September 2012. The book attracted controversy for claiming that \"the British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor\".[68] In 2022, Truss stated that the authors had each written a different chapter of the book; Raab had written the chapter which contained that claim.[68]\nTruss soon became well known amongst members of Parliament in Norfolk for her frequent photo ops but was well respected amongst Conservative MPs, who recognised her as dedicated and hard-working.[69] One of her staff members said that Truss's \"attention to the local stuff was just superb\".[70] Some of Truss's earliest contributions to parliamentary discourse were on the subject of education:[71] she advocated for more rigorous teaching in school subjects, especially mathematics,[72] calling for mathematics lessons to be compulsory for all students until the age of 18 and expressing concern about a perceived overreliance on calculators from primary school pupils.[73][74] Early in her tenure as justice secretary, in response to a question on what advice she would give young women, she replied simply \"be good at maths\".[75] Truss criticised \"[giving] media studies the same value as further maths\" and suggested in 2011 that students should have to sit GCSEs for \"5 traditional academic subjects\".[76]\nIn September 2012 Truss was appointed as parliamentary under-secretary of state for education and stepped back from the leadership of the FEG, with Kwarteng taking her place.[78] Truss was pleased with her appointment, and praised Michael Gove, the secretary of state for the department; she also formed a friendly rivalry with the future health secretaryMatt Hancock.[79] In January 2013, Truss wrote a white paper\u2014More Great Childcare[80]\u2014in which she proposed increasing the maximum number of children childminders could look after at a time from three to four, as a means of reducing childcare costs.[81][82] The press, including Conservative-leaning papers like The Daily Telegraph and The Times, were largely hostile to the plan. The former claimed that prices would not fall; the latter claimed that \"her appointment signal[led] a rapid deregulation of the sector\"; and the Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee challenged Truss to demonstrate how to care for so many children on her own.[81][83] Following a negative response from trade unions and childminders, Truss met with the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, who told her that \"some of this is fine\" but the maximum childminder increase went \"much too far\", and advised her to revise the proposal;[84] Truss ignored Clegg and pushed ahead with the plan, angering Clegg, who then blocked the proposals.[85][86][87] Truss also announced proposals to reform A-levels by concentrating exams at the end of two-year courses and said that the UK should attempt to \"out-educate\" countries in Asia.[77][88][89]\nDuring her two years in the department, Truss launched a ten-year strategy to counter falling bee populations,[97] approved the limited temporary lifting of a European Union ban on the use of two neonicotinoidpesticides[98][99] and cut subsidies for solar panels on agricultural land.[100] In March 2015 Truss was one of two cabinet ministers to vote against the government's proposal to mandate plain packaging for cigarettes.[101] When she had been asked previously about the issue during a constituency meeting, Truss said \"when it comes to things like this, I take a more libertarian approach... I don't know if it's the government's role to regulate this\".[70]\nAt the Conservative Party conference in September 2014 Truss made a speech in which she said \"we import two thirds of our cheese. That is a disgrace\" and \"in December, I'll be in Beijing, opening up new pork markets\".[102] Four days after Truss delivered the speech, parts of the video were featured on the satirical panel show Have I Got News For You;[102] the awkward, stilted delivery led her to be mocked and clips of the speech went viral online.[103] During the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union, Truss endorsed Remain, saying that the Conservatives had \"a golden chance to reform Britain over the next few years\" and to avoid \"[spending] that time negotiating Britain's exit from the European Union\".[104][105] The referendum resulted in the defeat of Remain and Cameron's resignation; the home secretaryTheresa May won the ensuing leadership election and subsequently became leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister.[106]\nBefore Truss's arrival, the budget of the Ministry of Justice\u2014which is responsible for the administration of British prisons\u2014had been subjected to successive cuts under the coalition government. The cuts were blamed for the prisons' rising rates of violence owing to the consequential drop in prison officer numbers.[113][114] Truss lobbied the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, for \u00a3104 million in order to hire an additional 2,500 officers, which Hammond reluctantly delivered.[115][116][117] In November 2016, Truss was accused of failing to support the judiciary after three judges of the High Court were criticised by politicians and by the Daily Mail\u2014which ran with the headline \"Enemies of the People\"\u2014for ruling against the government on whether Article 50\u2014which would begin the process of leaving the EU\u2014could be triggered without Parliament's approval.[118] A former lord chancellor, Charlie Falconer, suggested that, like her immediate predecessors, Truss lacked legal expertise and called for her to be dismissed as justice secretary as her perceived inadequate response \"[signalled] to the judges that they have lost their constitutional protector\".[119] She denied that she had failed to defend them, writing:\nAn independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law, vital to our constitution and freedoms. It is my duty as lord chancellor to defend that independence. I swore to do so under my oath of office. I take that very seriously, and I will always do so.[120]\nIn June, following the 2017 general election, May demoted Truss from justice secretary to chief secretary to the Treasury, meaning she could attend cabinet meetings but was not a full member;[121] Truss was enraged and called the demotion \"incredibly unfair\" and was, according to one of her friends, \"seething for a good couple of days\".[122][123] Despite what Cole and Heale describe as her \"knocked\" confidence from the demotion, Truss soon began to contribute to the department, using it, according to a Treasury worker, \"like her own personal think tank\" by asking for research and advice on monetary policy.[124] In her first few months there, she was largely left out of decision-making processes by Hammond, who was described by Kwarteng as \"quite a closed, centrally controlling chancellor\"; nevertheless, Truss and the chancellor were reported to have a good relationship.[125] Beginning in December 2017, she developed an enthusiasm for cultivating her presence on Twitter and Instagram; Truss began to plan ministerial visits around photo ops for her social media.[126][127][128] Some of her civil servants were reported as finding her tenure as chief secretary \"exhausting\", owing to her work schedule and asking them multiplication questions, a tactic she had first employed as an MP.[70][129] Despite her governmental role, Truss remained relatively unknown by the public, with only seven per cent recognising her in March 2019.[130]\nIn June 2018 Truss gave a speech criticising rules and regulations which she said \"just g[ot] in the way of consumers' choices and lifestyles\", including the government's efforts to reduce alcohol consumption and unhealthy eating habits, and warned that raising taxes could see the Conservatives being \"crushed\" at the polls.[131] She also attacked colleagues who she said should realise \"it's not macho just to demand more money\",[132] a jibe at the defence secretary Gavin Williamson, who had mounted a largely unsuccessful campaign for an extra \u00a320 billion for his department, including threatening to write \"Liz Truss blocked your pay\" to everybody in the British Armed Forces.[133][n 4] Truss's speech, which also mocked Michael Gove, was criticised by Hammond; Ed Vaizey, an ally of Gove's; and Gove himself;[135] a speech she gave in November similarly joked about Matt Hancock, the newly appointed home secretary, Sajid Javid, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt.[136] Before May's resignation announcement on 24 May 2019, Truss had sought the opinion of her colleagues on whether she could credibly stand, and courted media attention.[137][138] As it became apparent she could not win, she ruled herself out the day after May announced her resignation and subsequently endorsed the former foreign secretaryBoris Johnson, the first minister to do so.[139]\nAfter Johnson became prime minister, Truss was widely expected to be promoted because of her endorsement of his leadership campaign; it was thought she might have been appointed chancellor or business secretary, but she was instead promoted to the position of secretary of state for international trade and president of the Board of Trade.[141] Following the resignation of Amber Rudd, Truss was additionally appointed minister for women and equalities in September that year.[142] Shortly after becoming international trade secretary, Truss embarked on international trips to the US, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.[143] Truss met with her American counterpart Robert Lighthizer on her first trip to the US, where she gave what Cole and Heale describe as an \"incendiary\" speech on a potential US\u2013UK trade deal. In Australia she made unscripted comments on their free-trade negotiations with the UK; both events were to the dismay of Downing Street officials.[144] Truss continued to document her trips through social media.[145]\nIn February 2020 a reshuffle took place following the general election which had been held in December.[146] Truss feared that she would be dismissed after the comments she had made on her previous international trips, but Johnson decided to keep her in post following Javid's resignation as chancellor.[147] During her time at the Department for International Trade, Truss became notorious for leaking information.[148][149]Dominic Cummings, Johnson's chief adviser, later wrote that Truss was \"the only minister I shouted at in Number 10\" because of her \"compulsive pathological leaking\".[148] Truss's pursuit of a trade deal with the US concerned some in the National Farmers' Union (NFU), which worried about an influx of lower-quality food products if passed; the NFU, along with The Mail on Sunday, campaigned against such a deal in May.[150][151] The COVID-19 lockdowns eliminated international travel, and Truss instead attended virtual meetings.[152]\nIn early 2022 Truss's attention was directed towards a build-up of Russian troops near the Russia\u2013Ukraine border.[167] Truss supported a plan which declassified a large amount of intelligence on Russia, releasing it to the public for the first time in order to weaken the Russian government in the event of an invasion.[167] On 10 February 2022, she met the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, becoming the first British minister to go on a diplomatic trip there since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings.[171] The meeting was reportedly hard, with the two ministers having difficulty communicating with one another.[172][173][174] Five days later, Truss stated that the world was on the \"brink of war in Europe\",[175] which transpired in the early hours of 24 February as Russia invaded Ukraine.[176] Before the invasion and during its immediate aftermath, Truss advocated for sanctions on Russia and encouraged other G7 leaders to impose them;[170] in March 2022, she stated that the sanctions would end only in the event of a \"full ceasefire and withdrawal\".[177] Johnson praised Truss's actions, saying that \"she was always terrific on Ukraine... other governments faffed around... she was very clear and focused\".[178]\nOn 10 July Truss announced her intention to run in the leadership election to replace Johnson. She pledged to cut taxes, said she would \"fight the election as a Conservative and govern as a Conservative\" and would take \"immediate action to help people deal with the cost of living\".[186] She said she would cancel a planned rise in corporation tax and reverse the increase in National Insurance rates, funded by delaying the date by which the national debt was planned to fall, as part of a \"long-term plan to bring down the size of the state and the tax burden\".[187] The political scientist Vernon Bogdanor said in a 2022 article that \"[Truss] appreciated that winning over the membership required not detailed policy proposals but the creation of a mood\".[188]\nTruss received 50 votes on the first of Conservative MPs' 5 ballots, with the number of votes cast for her increasing in each;[189] on 20 July[190] Truss and Sunak were chosen by the parliamentary party to be put forward to the membership for the final leadership vote, with Truss receiving 113 votes to Sunak's 137.[191] In the membership vote, the leader of the 1922 Committee,[n 6]Graham Brady, announced on 5 September that 43 per cent of ballots were for Sunak and 57 per cent for Truss, making her the new leader.[193] In Truss's victory speech, she said that she would deliver on her campaign promises and pledged to win a \"great victory\" for the Conservatives at the next general election.[193]\nTruss was the fifteenth and final British prime minister to serve under Elizabeth II, who died on 8 September, two days after appointing Truss.[201][202] She was told in the early morning that the Queen was unwell and likely to survive a \"matter of hours, not days\";[194] Truss ordered black clothes from her Greenwich home in anticipation of the Queen's death, as she had not had time to move her belongings to Westminster.[203] Upon Elizabeth's death, Truss delivered a statement outside 10 Downing Street paying tribute to her:\nQueen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built. Our country has grown and flourished under her reign. Britain is the great country it is today because of her.... Through thick and thin, Queen Elizabeth II provided us with the stability and the strength that we needed. She was the very spirit of Great Britain, and that spirit will endure.[201]\nOn 8 September, in response to the ongoing cost of living crisis, Truss announced the Energy Price Guarantee, which was planned to cap average household energy bills at \u00a32,500 per year,[208] costing between 31 and \u00a3140 billion for the two years it covered.[209][210][211][212] Truss, who announced the measure in the House of Commons, made an effort to keep the energy cap and the tax plan announcements\u2014which the Chancellor was planned to unveil\u2014separate.[213]\nI think it's a shambles and a disgrace... I hope all those people that put Liz Truss into Number 10, I hope it was worth it... because the damage they have done to our party is extraordinary.\nCharles Walker's remarks on the market fallout, subsequent government crisis and Conservative unpopularity.[228]\nAfter initially defending the mini-budget, on 3 October Truss instructed Kwarteng to reverse the abolition of the 45 per cent income tax additional rate.[229] She later reversed the cut in corporation tax and dismissed Kwarteng, replacing him with Jeremy Hunt on 14 October.[227] Hunt reversed many of the remaining policies announced in the mini-budget, leading to further instability;[230][231] because of Truss's perceived weakness, he was described by some Conservative MPs and newspapers as the de facto prime minister.[232][233] During this time, Truss became increasingly unpopular with the public, and contributed to a large fall in support for the Conservatives;[234][235] in October, she became the most unpopular prime minister in British history,[191] with her personal approval rating recorded in one survey as nine per cent.[236] She was pilloried in national and international press as a u-turner,[237][238] and a chaotic vote on fracking along with the resignation of Braverman as home secretary compounded a rapid deterioration of confidence in her leadership.[239] On 19 October, in response to a question by the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, Truss said that she was a \"fighter and not a quitter\", quoting a 2001 phrase by Peter Mandelson.[240]\nShortly before noon on 20 October, Truss's forty-fifth day in office, Brady held a meeting with Truss where she asked if she would be able to remain in office;[230][241] his response was \"I don't think so, Prime Minister\".[241] At 1:35 pm, Truss announced her resignation as the leader of the Conservative Party and as prime minister. She gave the following 89-second-long statement:\nI came into office at a time of great economic and international instability. Families and businesses were worried about how to pay their bills. Putin's illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security of our whole continent. And our country has been held back by for too long by low economic growth. I was elected by the Conservative Party with a mandate to change this. We delivered on energy bills and on cutting National Insurance. And we set out a vision for a low-tax, high-growth economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. This morning I met the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. We've agreed there will be a leadership election to be completed within the next week. This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans and maintain our country's economic stability and national security. I will remain as prime minister until a successor has been chosen. Thank you.[242]\nHeale describes a \"funereal atmosphere\" within the government in the days following her resignation statement.[243] She was succeeded by Sunak as leader of the Conservative Party on 24 October and, the next day, advised the King to appoint him as the new prime minister;[244][245] Sunak went on to further reverse many of the economic measures she had made as prime minister but retained Hunt as chancellor.[246] Resigning on her fiftieth day, Truss became the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, surpassing George Canning, who was prime minister for 119 days in 1827.[247][n 7] The short length of her premiership was the subject of much ridicule, including a livestream of a head of lettuce, started the week prior, which invited viewers to speculate whether Truss would resign before the lettuce wilted.[248]\nTruss remains in the Commons as a backbencher. She was reselected as the Conservative candidate for South West Norfolk in February 2023,[249] and, in August that year, she submitted the list of her resignation honours which, as of September, are yet to be approved.[250] In early September 2023, Truss announced her memoirs about her time as prime minister\u2014titled Ten Years to Save the West\u2014which is planned to be released in April 2024.[251] That same month, Truss gave a speech to the Institute for Government think tank in which she blamed \"groupthink\" amongst officials and the media for the collapse of her premiership.[252]\nDuring her time as a Liberal Democrat, Truss supported the abolition of the monarchy. In 2022 a video of a 19-year-old Truss at the 1994 Liberal Democrat conference criticising the notion of people being \"born to rule\" resurfaced;[54] in an interview with LBC during her leadership campaign, Truss stated that \"almost as soon as I made the speech, I regretted it\".[257] In 2021 Truss stated that the Conservatives should \"reject the zero-sum game of identity politics, [reject] the illiberalism of cancel culture, and [reject] the soft bigotry of low expectations that holds so many people back\".[258] She voted to legalisesame-sex marriage but has opposed the expansion of transgender rights.[259] Truss spoke against gender self-identification, stating that \"medical checks are important\" and that \"only women have a cervix\".[260] Despite initially supporting single-sex toilets being restricted on the basis of biological sex, she later said in February 2022 that the government was not interested in enacting such a measure.[261]\nTruss supported the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union during the 2016 referendum.[272] Since the referendum, Truss has supported Brexit, and publicly stated in 2017 that she had changed her mind.[273] During the July 2022 leadership election, Truss said that \"I was wrong and I am prepared to admit I was wrong\".[274]",

        "context": "\nPrinceton University mathematician June Huh was awarded today the 2022 Fields Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics, in recognition of his work in combinatorics. The International Mathematical Union (IMU) presents the medal every four years to researchers under the age of 40 based on the influence of their existing work and on their \u201cpromise of future achievement.\u201d\nJune Huh\nPhoto by\nDenise Applewhite, Office of Communications\nThe honor, often referred to as the \u201cNobel Prize of mathematics,\u201d was awarded to Huh and three other early career researchers at the 2022 IMU Award Ceremony in Helsinki, Finland. Awards were bestowed on two other Princeton professors at the ceremony: the Abacus Medal to Mark Braverman in the Department of Computer Science, and the Carl Friedrich Gauss Prize to Elliott Lieb, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics, Emeritus, and Professor of Mathematical Physics, Emeritus.\nThe IMU citation for Huh (PDF) noted that \"using methods of Hodge theory, tropical geometry and singularity theory, June Huh, with his collaborators, has transformed the field of geometric combinatorics.\"\nHuh's research focuses on geometry, topology, and the combinatorics of algebraic varieties. At the award ceremony, the IMU played a video profiling Huh in which he explained his work.\nAmong Huh's accomplishments cited by the IMU, he and collaborators Eric Katz and Karim Adiprasito proved the Rota conjecture in 2015 by applying Hodge theory, combining tools from disparate areas of mathematics in novel ways.In more recent works, Huh and collaborators proposed a general framework that treats discrete objects from a geometric viewpoint. This led to proofs of several other longstanding problems in combinatorics, such as the 1972 conjecture of Mason and the 1973 conjecture of Dowling--Wilson.\nIgor Rodnianski, a professor of mathematics and the department chair, said Huh is \"a remarkable mathematician whose work is reshaping the field of geometric combinatorics. His mathematical talent is only matched by his amazing ability as a communicator. Very rarely one meets a mathematician whose theorems are as deep as their expositions are elegant. We are delighted for June receiving this award and proud to be his colleagues.\u201d\nHuh said he learned of the Fields honor in an after-hours phone call from the IMU president. Huh said he was excited but wasn't sure if he should awaken his wife. After waiting 10 minutes, he did. \"I told her the news and then she said, 'Oh, I knew it \u2014 it will happen,' and then fell back to sleep,\" he said.\nHuh noted that he came to mathematics relatively late in life for the field. He received an undergraduate degree in physics and astronomy at Seoul National University. Inspired and mentored by Heisuke Hironaka, a visiting professor from Japan who won the Fields Medal in 1970, Huh switched to mathematics for his masters degree at Seoul National University and continued for his Ph.D. under Mircea Musta\u0163\u0103 at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor in 2014.\nHuh said he sometimes regrets that he didn't focus on math earlier. \"But at other times, it seems that very curvy road I went through was actually the optimal path, at least for me,\" he said.\nHuh has received numerous other awards for his work, including the New Horizons in Mathematics Prize from the Breakthrough Prize Foundation (2019) and a Clay Research Fellowship (2014). He was invited to speak at the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians.\nHe joined the Princeton faculty in 2021 and had taught at the University twice previously: in Spring 2017, when he was the Oswald Veblen Fellow at Princeton, and in the 2019-2020 academic year, when he was the Robert and Luisa Fernholz Visiting Professor of Mathematics.\nRodnianski called the award to Huh \"an outstanding occasion for the Princeton mathematics department and the University.\"\nThe other Fields Medal awardees were Hugo Duminil-Copin of the Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve and Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques (IH\u00c9S), James Maynard of Oxford University and Maryna Viazovska of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL).\nEqual Opportunity and Nondiscrimination at Princeton University: Princeton University believes that commitment to principles of fairness and respect for all is favorable to the free and open exchange of ideas, and the University seeks to reach out as widely as possible in order to attract the ablest individuals as students, faculty, and staff.

        "context": "\nBut when Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO in 2008, Putin warned that their membership would be a threat to Russia.[17] Some NATO members worried about antagonizing Russia.[18] At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia membership, but Jaap de Hoop Scheffer also issued a statement that they would join one day.[19] Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would do everything it could to prevent this.[20] Putin claimed that NATO members had promised in 1990 not to let Eastern European countries join. That statement is disputed.[21]\nIn March and April 2021, Russia built up its forces near the Russia\u2013Ukraine border,[38] and again in both Russia and Belarus between October 2021 and February 2022.[39] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine.[40][41] The decision to invade Ukraine was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in Putin's inner circle, including national security adviser Nikolai Patrushev and defense ministerSergei Shoigu.[42]\nDuring the second build-up, Russia demanded that NATO end all activity in Eastern Europe and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO.[43] Russia threatened an unspecified military response if NATO followed an \"aggressive line.\"[44] These demands were widely seen as non-viable; Eastern European states have willingly joined NATO for security reasons, and their governments sought protection from Russian irredentism.[45] A treaty to prevent Ukraine joining would go against NATO's \"open door\" policy, despite NATO's unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join.[46] NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that \"Russia has no say\" on whether Ukraine joins, and that \"Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors.\"[47] NATO's official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, and NATO and Russia had co-operated until Russia annexed Crimea.[48] NATO offered to improve communication with Russia to discuss missile placements and military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's borders,[49] but Russia did not do so.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both made efforts in February 2022 to prevent war.[50] Macron met Putin but failed to dissuade him from the invasion. Scholz warned Putin of heavy sanctions would be imposed should he invade, and told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to declare Ukraine a neutral state and renounce its aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted to uphold such a settlement.[51]\nOn 21 February, Putin announced Russian diplomatic recognition of the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states: the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The following day, Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as \"peacekeepers\",[52] and the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad.[53]\nPutin's address to the nation on 24 February 2022. Minutes after Putin's announcement, the invasion began.\nBefore 5 a.m. Kyiv time on February 24, Putin in another speech announced, a \"special military operation\", which \"effectively declar[ed] war on Ukraine.\"[54][55] Putin said the operation was to \"protect the people\" of the Russian-controlled breakaway republics. He falsely claimed that they had \"been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime.\"[56] Putin also falsely claimed that Ukrainian government officials were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[57] He said Russia sought the \"demilitarisation and denazification\" of Ukraine, and espoused views challenging Ukraine's right to exist.[58][59] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[57] Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[60] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east, and south.[61] Russia did not officially declare war.[62] Reports of an alleged leak of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[63]\nThe invasion, described as the biggest attack on a European country since the Second World War, began at dawn on 24 February.[54][64] Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air campaign, commencing air and missile strikes across Ukraine,[65][66] with some rockets reaching as far west as Lviv.[67] It is Russia's largest combined arms operation since the Battle of Berlin in 1945.[68] Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time near Milove on the border with Russia.[69] The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a southeastern front from Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy.[70] Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white Z military symbol (a non-Cyrillic letter), believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.[71]\nOn the southern front, Russian forces had captured the regional capital of Kherson by 2 March. A column of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles was ambushed on 9 March in Brovary and sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat.[79] The Russian army adopted siege tactics on the western front around the key cities of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, but failed to capture them due to stiff resistance and logistical setbacks.[80] In Mykolaiv Oblast, Russian forces advanced as far as Voznesensk, but were repelled and pushed back south of Mykolaiv. On 25 March, the Russian Defence Ministry stated that the first stage of the \"military operation\" in Ukraine was \"generally complete\", that the Ukrainian military forces had suffered serious losses, and the Russian military would now concentrate on the \"liberation of Donbas.\"[81] The \"first stage\" of the invasion was conducted on four fronts, including one towards western Kyiv from Belarus by the Russian Eastern Military District, comprising the 29th, 35th, and 36th Combined Arms Armies. A second axis, deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the Central Military District (northeastern front), comprised the 41st Combined Arms Army and the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army.[82]\nA third axis was deployed towards Kharkiv by the Western Military District (eastern front), with the 1st Guards Tank Army and 20th Combined Arms Army. A fourth, southern front originating in occupied Crimea and Russia's Rostov oblast with an eastern axis towards Odesa and a western area of operations toward Mariupol was opened by the Southern Military District, including the 58th, 49th, and 8th Combined Arms Army, the latter also commanding the 1st and 2nd Army Corps of the Russian separatist forces in Donbas.[82] By 7 April, Russian troops deployed to the northern front by the Russian Eastern Military District pulled back from the Kyiv offensive, reportedly to resupply and redeploy to the Donbas region in an effort to reinforce the renewed invasion of southeastern Ukraine. The northeastern front, including the Central Military District, was similarly withdrawn for resupply and redeployment to southeastern Ukraine.[82][83] On 26 April, delegates from the US and 40 allied nations met at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss the formation of a coalition that would provide economic support in addition to military supplies and refitting to Ukraine.[84] Following Putin's Victory Day speech in early May, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said no short term resolution to the invasion should be expected.[85]\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy with members of the Ukrainian Army on 18 June 2022\nUkraine's reliance on Western-supplied equipment constrained operational effectiveness, as supplying countries feared that Ukraine would use Western-made mat\u00e9riel to strike targets in Russia.[86] Military experts disagreed on the future of the conflict; some suggested that Ukraine should trade territory for peace,[87] while others believed that Ukraine could maintain its resistance thanks to Russian losses.[88]\nBy 30 May, disparities between Russian and Ukrainian artillery were apparent, with Ukrainian artillery being vastly outgunned, in terms of both range and number.[86] In response to US PresidentJoe Biden's indication that enhanced artillery would be provided to Ukraine, Putin said that Russia would expand its invasion front to include new cities in Ukraine. In apparent retribution, Putin ordered a missile strike against Kyiv on 6 June after not directly attacking the city for several weeks.[89] On 10 June 2022, deputy head of the SBU Vadym Skibitsky stated that during the Severodonetsk campaign, the frontlines were where the future of the invasion would be decided: \"This is an artillery war now, and we are losing in terms of artillery. Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us. Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.\"[90] On 29 June, Reuters reported that US Intelligence Director Avril Haines, in an update of past U.S. intelligence assessments on the Russian invasion, said that U.S. intelligence agencies agree that the invasion will continue \"for an extended period of time ... In short, the picture remains pretty grim and Russia's attitude toward the West is hardening.\"[91] On 5 July, BBC reported that extensive destruction by the Russian invasion would cause immense financial damage to Ukraine's reconstruction economy, with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal telling nations at a reconstruction conference in Switzerland that Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost.[92]\nThe invasion began on 24 February, launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv, and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv. The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads, from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk.\nRussian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River. The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and from the east at Sumy. These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the north-east and east.[66][65]\nRussia tried to seize Kyiv quickly, with Spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north, but failed.[93][94] The United States contacted Zelenskyy and offered to help him flee the country, lest the Russian Army attempt to kidnap or kill him on seizing Kyiv; Zelenskyy responded that \"The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.\"[95]The Washington Post, which described the quote as \"one of the most-cited lines of the Russian invasion\", was not entirely sure of the comment's accuracy. Reporter Glenn Kessler said it came from \"a single source, but on the surface it appears to be a good one.\"[96] Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus gained control of the ghost town of Chernobyl.[97]Russian Airborne Forces attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv, launching an airborne assault on Antonov Airport,[98] and a similar landing at Vasylkiv, near Vasylkiv Air Base, on 26 February.[99]\nBy early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences.[66][65] As of 5 March, a large Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) long, had made little progress toward Kyiv.[100] The London-based think tankRoyal United Services Institute (RUSI) assessed Russian advances from the north and east as \"stalled.\"[101] Advances from Chernihiv largely halted as a siege began there. Russian forces continued to advance on Kyiv from the northwest, capturing Bucha, Hostomel, and Vorzel by 5 March,[102][103] though Irpin remained contested as of 9 March.[104] By 11 March, the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed and taken cover.[105] On 16 March, Ukrainian forces began a counter-offensive to repel Russian forces.[106] Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv, Russian forces switched their strategy to indiscriminate bombing and siege warfare.[107][108]\nOn 25 March, a Ukrainian counter-offensive retook several towns to the east and west of Kyiv, including Makariv.[109][110] Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north at the end of March. Ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 April.[111] Ukraine said it had recaptured the entire region around Kyiv, including Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel, and uncovered evidence of war crimes in Bucha.[112] On 6 April, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that the Russian \"retraction, resupply, and redeployment\" of their troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin's plans for Ukraine, by redeploying and concentrating his forces on eastern Ukraine.[83] Kyiv was generally left free from attack apart from isolated missile strikes. One did occur while UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres was visiting Kyiv on 28 April to discuss the survivors of the siege of Mariupol with Zelenskyy. One person was killed and several were injured in the attack.[113]\nOn 4 March, Frederick Kagan wrote that the Sumy axis was then \"the most successful and dangerous Russian avenue of advance on Kyiv\", and commented that the geography favoured mechanised advances as the terrain \"is flat and sparsely populated, offering few good defensive positions.\"[65] Travelling along highways, Russian forces reached Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on 4 March.[66][65]The Pentagon confirmed on 6 April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast, but Sumy Oblast remained contested.[118] On 7 April, the governor of Sumy Oblast said that Russian troops were gone, but had left behind rigged explosives and other hazards.[119]\nAfter renewed missile attacks on 14 March in Mariupol, the Ukrainian government said more than 2,500 had died.[135] By 18 March, Mariupol was completely encircled and fighting reached the city centre, hampering efforts to evacuate civilians.[136] On 20 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people, was destroyed by Russian bombs.[137] The Russians demanded surrender, and the Ukrainians refused.[70][138] On 27 March, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said that \"(m)ore than 85 percent of the whole town is destroyed.\"[139]\nPutin told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on 29 March that the bombardment of Mariupol would only end when the Ukrainians surrendered.[140] On 1 April, Russian troops refused safe passage into Mariupol to 50 buses sent by the United Nations to evacuate civilians, as peace talks continued in Istanbul.[141] On 3 April, following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Russia expanded its attack on southern Ukraine further west, with bombardment and strikes against Odesa, Mykolaiv, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.[142][143]\nOn 25 March, the Russian defence ministry said it would seek to occupy major cities in eastern Ukraine.[149] On 31 March, the Ukrainian military confirmed Izium was under Russian control,[150] and PBS News reported renewed shelling and missile attacks in Kharkiv, as bad or worse than before, as peace talks with Russia were to resume in Istanbul.[151]\nAmid the heightened Russian shelling of Kharkiv on 31 March, Russia reported a helicopter strike against an oil supply depot approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of the border in Belgorod, and accused Ukraine of the attack.[152] Ukraine denied responsibility.[153] By 7 April, the renewed massing of Russian invasion troops and tank divisions around the towns of Izium, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian government officials to advise the remaining residents near the eastern border of Ukraine to evacuate to western Ukraine within 2\u20133 days, given the absence of arms and munitions previously promised to Ukraine by then.[154]\nBy 17 April, Russian progress on the southeastern front appeared to be impeded by opposing Ukrainian forces in the large, heavily fortified Azovstal steel mill and surrounding area in Mariupol.[155]\nOn 19 April, The New York Times confirmed that Russia had launched a renewed invasion front referred to as an \"eastern assault\" across a 480-kilometre (300 mi) front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk, with simultaneous missile attacks again directed at Kyiv in the north and Lviv in western Ukraine.[156] As of 30 April, a NATO official described Russian advances as \"uneven\" and \"minor.\"[157] An anonymous US Defence official called the Russian offensive \"very tepid\", \"minimal at best\", and \"anaemic.\"[158]\nIn June 2022 the chief spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defence Igor Konashenkov revealed that Russian troops were divided between the Army Groups \"Center\" commanded by Colonel General Aleksander Lapin and \"South\" commanded by Army General Sergey Surovikin.[159] On 20 July, Lavrov announced that Russia would respond to the increased military aid being received by Ukraine from abroad as justifying the expansion of its special military operation to include objectives in both the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.[160]\nRussian Ground Forces started recruiting volunteer battalions from the regions in June 2022 to create a new 3rd Army Corps within the Western Military District, with a planned strength estimated at 15,500\u201360,000 personnel.[161] Its units were deployed to the front around the time of Ukraine's 9 September Kharkiv oblast counteroffensive, in time to join the Russian retreat, leaving behind tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and personnel carriers: the 3rd Army Corps \"melted away\" according to Forbes, having little or no impact on the battlefield along with other irregular forces.[162]\nOn 13 April, Russian forces intensified their attack on the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol, and the remaining Ukrainian personnel defending it.[163] By 17 April, Russian forces had surrounded the factory. Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said that the Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the renewed ultimatum to surrender and to fight to the last soul.[164] On 20 April, Putin said that the siege of Mariupol could be considered tactically complete, since the 500 Ukrainian troops entrenched in bunkers within the Azovstal iron works and estimated 1,000 Ukrainian civilians were completely sealed off from any type of relief.[165]\nAfter consecutive meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy, UN Secretary-General Guterres on 28 April said he would attempt to organise an emergency evacuation of survivors from Azovstal in accordance with assurances he had received from Putin on his visit to the Kremlin.[166] On 30 April, Russian troops allowed civilians to leave under UN protection.[167] By 3 May, after allowing approximately 100 Ukrainian civilians to depart from the Azovstal steel factory, Russian troops renewed their bombardment of the steel factory.[168] On 6 May, The Daily Telegraph reported that Russia had used thermobaric bombs against the remaining Ukrainian soldiers, who had lost contact with the Kyiv government; in his last communications, Zelenskyy authorised the commander of the besieged steel factory to surrender as necessary under the pressure of increased Russian attacks.[169] On 7 May, the Associated Press reported that all civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal steel works at the end of the three-day ceasefire.[170]\nAfter the last civilians evacuated from the Azovstal bunkers, nearly two thousand Ukrainian soldiers remained barricaded there, 700 of them injured. They were able to communicate a plea for a military corridor to evacuate, as they expected summary execution if they surrendered to Russian forces.[171] Reports of dissent within the Ukrainian troops at Azovstal were reported by Ukrainska Pravda on 8 May indicating that the commander of the Ukrainian Marines assigned to defend the Azovstal bunkers made an unauthorised acquisition of tanks, munitions, and personnel, broke out from the position there and fled. The remaining soldiers spoke of a weakened defensive position in Azovstal as a result, which allowed progress to advancing Russian lines of attack.[172]Ilia Somolienko, deputy commander of the remaining Ukrainian troops barricaded at Azovstal, said: \"We are basically here dead men. Most of us know this and it's why we fight so fearlessly.\"[173]\nOn 16 May, the Ukrainian General staff announced that the Mariupol garrison had \"fulfilled its combat mission\" and that final evacuations from the Azovstal steel factory had begun. The military said that 264 service members were evacuated to Olenivka under Russian control, while 53 of them who were \"seriously injured\" had been taken to a hospital in Novoazovsk also controlled by Russian forces.[174][175] Following the evacuation of Ukrainian personnel from Azovstal, Russian and DPR forces fully controlled all areas of Mariupol. The end of the battle also brought an end to the Siege of Mariupol. Russia press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had guaranteed that the fighters who surrendered would be treated \"in accordance with international standards\" while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address that \"the work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy\u2014and time.\" Some prominent Russian lawmakers called on the government to deny prisoner exchanges for members of the Azov Regiment.[176]\nMilitary control around Donbas as of 24 March 2023: pink highlights areas held by the DNR, LNR, and Russia, yellow highlights areas held by the Ukrainian government.\nA Russian missile attack on Kramatorsk railway station in the city of Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, reportedly killing at least 52 people[177] and injuring as many as 87 to 300.[178] On 11 April, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a major new Russian offensive in the east.[179] American officials said that Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere in Ukraine, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment of infantry and tank divisions to the southeastern Ukraine front.[180][181] Military satellites photographed extensive Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment of its northeastern troops to the southeastern front of the invasion.[182]\nOn 18 April, with Mariupol almost entirely overtaken by Russian forces, the Ukrainian government announced that the second phase of the reinforced invasion of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions had intensified with expanded invasion forces occupying of the Donbas.[183]\nOn 22 May, the BBC reported that after the fall of Mariupol, Russia had intensified offensives in Luhansk and Donetsk while concentrating missile attacks and intense artillery fire on Sievierodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province.[184]\nOn 23 May, Russian forces were reported entering the city of Lyman, fully capturing the city by 26 May.[185][186] Ukrainian forces were reported leaving Sviatohirsk.[187] By 24 May, Russian forces captured the city of Svitlodarsk.[188] On 30 May, Reuters reported that Russian troops had breached the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk.[189] By 2 June, The Washington Post reported that Sievierodonetsk was on the brink of capitulation to Russian occupation with over 80 per cent of the city in the hands of Russian troops.[190] On 3 June, Ukrainian forces reportedly began a counter-attack in Sievierodonetsk. By 4 June, Ukrainian government sources claimed 20% or more of the city had been recaptured.[191]\nOn 12 June, it was reported that possibly as many as 800 Ukrainian civilians (as per Ukrainian estimates) and 300\u2013400 soldiers (as per Russian sources) were besieged at the Azot chemical factory in Severodonetsk.[192][193] With the Ukrainian defences of Severodonetsk faltering, Russian invasion troops began intensifying their attack upon the neighbouring city of Lysychansk as their next target city in the invasion.[194] On 20 June it was reported that Russian troops continued to tighten their grip on Severodonetsk by capturing surrounding villages and hamlets surrounding the city, most recently the village of Metelkine.[195]\nOn 24 June, CNN reported that, amid continuing scorched-earth tactics being applied by advancing Russian troops, Ukraine's armed forces were ordered to evacuate the Severodonetsk; several hundred civilians taking refuge in the Azot chemical plant were left behind in the withdrawal, with some comparing their plight to that of the civilians at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol in May.[196] On 3 July, CBS announced that the Russian defense ministry claimed that the city of Lysychansk had been captured and occupied by Russian forces.[197] On 4 July, The Guardian reported that after the fall of the Luhansk oblast, that Russian invasion troops would continue their invasion into the adjacent Donetsk Oblast to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Bakhmut.[198]\nOn 14 April, Ukrainian troops reportedly blew up a bridge between Kharkiv and Izium used by Russian forces to redeploy troops to Izium, impeding the Russian convoy.[199]\nOn 5 May, David Axe writing for Forbes stated that the Ukrainian army had concentrated its 4th and 17th Tank Brigades and the 95th Air Assault Brigade around Izium for possible rearguard action against the deployed Russian troops in the area; Axe added that the other major concentration of Ukraine's forces around Kharkiv included the 92nd and 93rd Mechanised Brigades which could similarly be deployed for rearguard action against Russian troops around Kharkiv or link up with Ukrainian troops contemporaneously being deployed around Izium.[200]\nOn 13 May, BBC reported that Russian troops in Kharkiv were being retracted and redeployed to other fronts in Ukraine following the advances of Ukrainian troops into surrounding cities and Kharkiv itself, which included the destruction of strategic pontoon bridges built by Russian troops to cross over the Seversky Donets river and previously used for rapid tank deployment in the region.[201]\nMissile attacks and bombardment of the key cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa continued as the second phase of the invasion began.[156] On 22 April 2022, Russia's Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev in a defence ministry meeting said that Russia planned to extend its Mykolaiv\u2013Odesa front after the siege of Mariupol further west to include the breakaway region of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border with Moldova.[202] The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine called this plan imperialism and said that it contradicted previous Russian claims that it did not have territorial ambitions in Ukraine and also that the statement admitted that \"the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\"[202] Georgi Gotev of EURACTIV noted on 22 April that Russian occupation from Odesa to Transnistria would transform Ukraine into a landlocked nation with no practical access to the Black Sea.[203] Russia resumed its missile strikes on Odesa on 24 April, destroying military facilities and causing two dozen civilian casualties.[204]\nExplosions destroyed two Russian broadcast towers in Transnistria on 27 April that had primarily rebroadcast Russian television programming, Ukrainian sources said.[205] Russiah missile attacks at the end of April destroyed runways in Odesa.[206] In the week of 10 May, Ukrainian troops began to dislodge Russian forces from Snake Island in the Black Sea approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) from Odesa.[207] Russia said on 30 June 2022 that it had withdrawn its troops from the island, once their objectives had been completed.[208]\nOn 23 July, CNBC reported a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian port of Odesa, swiftly condemned by world leaders amid a recent U.N. and Turkish-brokered deal to secure a sea corridor for exports of grains and other foodstuffs.[209] On 31 July, CNN reported significantly intensified rocket attacks and bombing of Mykolaiv by Russians, which also killed Ukrainian grain tycoon Oleksiy Vadaturskyi.[210]\nRussian forces continued to fire missiles and drop bombs on the key cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.[156] Russian missiles destroyed the Dnipro International Airport on 10 April 2022.[211] On 2 May the UN, reportedly with the cooperation of Russian troops, evacuated about 100 survivors from the siege of Mariupol to the village of Bezimenne near Donetsk, from whence they would move to Zaporizhzhia.[212] On 28 June, Reuters reported that a Russian missile attack on the city of Kremenchuk northwest of Zaporizhzhia detonated in a public mall and caused at least 18 deaths. France's Emmanuel Macron called it a \"war crime.\"[213][failed verification]\nUkrainian nuclear agency Energoatom called the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant \"extremely tense\", although it was still operated by its Ukrainian staff. As many as 500 Russian soldiers controlled the plant; Kyiv's nuclear agency said they were shelling nearby areas and storing weapons and \"missile systems\" there. Almost the entire country went on air raid alert. \"They already shell the other side of the river Dnipro and the territory of Nikopol,\" Energoatom president Pedro Kotin said.[214] Russia agreed on 19 August to allow IAEA inspectors access to the Zaporizhzhia plant after a phone call from Macron to Putin. As of July 2023, however, access to the plant remained limited and required extensive negotiation.[215]\nRussia reported that 12 attacks with explosions from 50 artillery shells had been recorded by 18 August at the plant and the company town of Enerhodar.[216]Tobias Ellwood, chair of the UK's Defence Select Committee, said on 19 August that any deliberate damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that could cause radiation leaks would be a breach of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, under which an attack on a member state of NATO is an attack on them all. US congressman Adam Kinzinger said the following day that any radiation leak would kill people in NATO countries, an automatic activation of Article 5.[217][218]\nShelling hit coal ash dumps at the neighbouring coal-fired power station on 23 August, and the ash was on fire on 25 August. The 750kV transmission line to the Dniprovska substation, the only one of the four 750 kV transmission lines still undamaged and cut by military action, passes over the ash dumps. At 12:12 p.m. on 25 August the line cut off due to the fire, disconnecting the plant and its two operating reactors from the national grid for the first time since its startup in 1985. In response back-up generators and coolant pumps for reactor 5 started up, and reactor 6 reduced generation.[219]\nIncoming power was still available across the 330 kV line to the substation at the coal-fired station, so the diesel generators were not essential for cooling reactor cores and spent fuel pools. The 750 kV line and reactor 6 resumed operation at 12:29 p.m., but the line was cut by fire again two hours later. The line, but not the reactors, resumed operation again later that day.[219] On 26 August, one reactor restarted in the afternoon and another in the evening, resuming electricity supplies to the grid.[220] On 29 August 2022, an IAEA team led by Rafael Grossi went to the plant to investigate .[221]Lydie Evrard and Massimo Aparo were also on the team. No leaks had been reported at the plant before their arrival, but shelling had occurred days before.[222]\nAnimated map of the Russian invasion from 5 September 2022 to 11 November 2022\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, beginning near Balakliia, led by General Syrskyi.[223] An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive 12 September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for The New York Times to say that it dented the image of a \"Mighty Putin\". Kiev sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive.[224] On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and minister of defence Sergei Shoigu said 300,000 reservists would be called.[225] He also said that his country would use \"all means\" to \"defend itself.\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable, and was an attempt to justify \"Russia's failures.\"[226] British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an \"escalation\",[227] while former Mongolian president Tsakhia Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as \"cannon fodder.\"[228]\nIn late September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine organised referendums on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine. These included the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in Russian occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as well as the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Denounced by Ukraine's government and its allies as sham elections, the elections' official results showed overwhelming majorities in favor of annexation.[229]\nOn 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament.[230] Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all denounced the annexation as illegal.[231]\nAn IAEA delegation visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 3 September, and on 6 September reported damage and security threats caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant.[233] On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, \"completely stopping\" the plant. Energoatom said that preparations were \"underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state.\"[234]\nOn 29 August, Zelenskyy advisedly vowed the start of a full-scale counteroffensive in the southeast. He first announced a counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south concentrating on the Kherson-Mykolaiv region, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as Operational Command South.[236]\nOn 4 September, Zelenskyy announced the liberation of two unnamed villages in Kherson Oblast and one in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities released a photo showing the raising of the Ukrainian flag in Vysokopillia by Ukrainian forces.[237] Ukrainian attacks also continued along the southern frontline, though reports about territorial changes were largely unverifiable.[238] On 12 September, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces had retaken a total of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) from Russia, in both the south and the east. The BBC stated that it could not verify these claims.[239]\nIn October, Ukrainian forces pushed further south towards the city of Kherson, taking control of 1,170 square kilometres (450 sq mi) of territory, with fighting extending to Dudchany.[240][241] On 9 November, defence minister Shoigu ordered Russian forces to leave part of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson, and move to the eastern bank of the Dnieper.[242] On 11 November, Ukrainian troops entered Kherson, as Russia completed its withdrawal. This meant that Russian forces no longer had a foothold on the west (right) bank of the Dnieper.[243]\nControlled by Ukraine Occupied by Russia Map of the Kharkiv front as of 14 November 2023\nUkrainian forces launched another surprise counteroffensive on 6 September in the Kharkiv region near Balakliia led by General Syrskyi.[223] By 7 September, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 kilometres (12 mi) into Russian occupied territory and claimed to have recaptured approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi). Russian commentators said this was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson in response to the Ukrainian offensive there.[244] On 8 September, Ukrainian forces captured Balakliia and advanced to within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) of Kupiansk.[245] Military analysts said Ukrainian forces appeared to be moving towards Kupiansk, a major railway hub, with the aim of cutting off the Russian forces at Izium from the north.[246]\nOn 9 September, the Russian occupation administration of Kharkiv Oblast announced it would \"evacuate\" the civilian populations of Izium, Kupiansk and Velykyi Burluk. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said it believed Kupiansk would likely fall in the next 72 hours,[247] while Russian reserve units were sent to the area by both road and helicopter.[248] On the morning of 10 September, photos emerged claiming to depict Ukrainian troops raising the Ukrainian flag in the centre of Kupiansk,[249] and the ISW said Ukrainian forces had captured approximately 2,500 square kilometres (970 sq mi) by effectively exploiting their breakthrough.[250] Later in the day, Reuters reported that Russian positions in northeast Ukraine had \"collapsed\" in the face of the Ukrainian assault, with Russian forces forced to withdraw from their base at Izium after being cut off by the capture of Kupiansk.[251]\nBy 15 September, an assessment by UK's Ministry of Defence confirmed that Russia had either lost or withdrawn from almost all of their positions west of the Oskil river. The retreating units had also abandoned various high-value military assets.[252] The offensive continued pushing east and by 2 October, Ukrainian Armed Forces had liberated another key city in the Second Battle of Lyman.[253]\nAfter the end of the twin Ukrainian counteroffensives, the fighting shifted to a semi-deadlock during the winter,[254] with heavy casualties but reduced motion of the frontline.[255] Russia launched a self-proclaimed winter offensive in eastern Ukraine, but the campaign ended in \"disappointment\" for Moscow, with limited gains as the offensive stalled.[254][256] Analysts variously blamed the failure on Russia's lack of \"trained men\", and supply problems with artillery ammunition, among other problems.[254][256] Near the end of May, Mark Galeotti assessed that \"after Russia's abortive and ill-conceived winter offensive, which squandered its opportunity to consolidate its forces, Ukraine is in a relatively strong position.\"[257]\nOn 7 February, The New York Times reported that Russians had newly mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers to participate in the offensive in the Donbas, against Ukraine troops already wearied by previous fighting.[258] The Russian private military company Wagner Group took on greater prominence in the war,[259] leading \"grinding advances\" in Bakhmut with tens of thousands of recruits from prison battalions taking part in \"near suicidal\" assaults on Ukrainian positions.[256]\nIn late January 2023, fighting intensified in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.[260] In nearby southern parts of Donetsk Oblast, an intense, three-week Russian assault near the coal-mining town of Vuhledar was called the largest tank battle of the war to date, and ended in disaster for Russian forces, who lost \"at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers\" according to Ukrainian commanders. The British Ministry of Defense stated that \"a whole Russian brigade was effectively annihilated.\"[261][262]\nFollowing defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces have focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half year long stalemate that has prevailed there since the start of the war. Russian forces have sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via Soledar. After taking heavy casualties, Russian and Wagner forces took control of Soledar on 16 January 2023.[263][264] By early February 2023, Bakhmut was facing attacks from north, south and east, with the sole Ukrainian supply lines coming from Chasiv Yar to the west.[265]\nOn 3 March 2023, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed two key bridges, creating the possibility for a controlled fighting withdrawal from eastern sectors of Bakhmut.[266] On 4 March, Bakhmut's deputy mayor told news services that there was street fighting in the city.[267] On 7 March, despite the city's near-encirclement, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian commanders were requesting permission from Kyiv to continue fighting against the Russians in Bakhmut.[268]\nOn 26 March, Wagner Group forces claimed to have fully captured the tactically significant Azom factory in Bakhmut.[269] Appearing before the House Committee on Armed Services on 29 March, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported that, \"for about the last 20, 21 days, the Russia have not made any progress whatsoever in and around Bakhmut.\" Milley described the severe casualties being inflicted upon the Russian forces there as a \"slaughter-fest.\"[270]\nBy the beginning of May, the ISW assessed that Ukraine controlled only 1.89 square kilometres of the city, less than five percent.[271] On 18 May 2023, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces had launched a local counteroffensive, taking back swathes of territory to the north and south of Bakhmut over the course of a few days.[272]\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian forces gradually launched a series of counteroffensives on multiple fronts, including Donetsk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and others.[273] On 8 June 2023, counteroffensive efforts focused near settlements such as Orikhiv, Tokmak, and Bakhmut.[274] However, counteroffensive operations have faced stiff resistance from Russia,[275] and the American think tank Institute for the Study of War called the Russian defensive effort as having \"an uncharacteristic degree of coherency.\"[276] By 12 June, Ukraine reported its fastest advance in seven months, claiming to have liberated several villages and advanced a total of 6.5 km. Russian military bloggers also reported that Ukraine had taken Blahodatne, Makarivka and Neskuchne, and were continuing to push southward.[277] Ukraine continued to liberate settlements over the next few months, raising the Ukrainian flag over the significant settlement of Robotyne in late August.[278]\nOn 24 June, the Wagner Group launched a brief rebellion against the Russian government, capturing several cities in western Russia largely unopposed before marching towards Moscow.[279] This came as the culmination of prolonged infighting and power struggles between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defense.[280] After about 24 hours, the Wagner Group backed down[281] and agreed to a peace deal in which Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin would go into exile in Belarus, and his forces would be free from prosecution.[279] On 27 June, the UK's Ministry of Defence reported that Ukraine were \"highly likely\" to have reclaimed territory in the eastern Donbas region occupied by Russia since 2014 among its advances. Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.[282]\nIn August, The Guardian reported that Ukraine had become the most mined country in the world, with Russia laying millions of mines attempting to thwart Ukraine's counteroffensive. The vast minefields forced Ukraine to extensively de-mine areas to allow advances. Ukrainian officials reported shortages of men and equipment as Ukrainian soldiers unearth five mines for every square metre in certain places.[283]\nFollowing Russia pulling out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the conflict on the Black Sea escalated with Ukraine targeting Russian ships. On 4 August, Ukrainian security service sources reported that the Russian landing ship Olenegorsky Gornyak had been hit and damaged by an unmanned naval drone. Video footage released by Ukraine's security services appeared to show the drone striking the ship, with another video showing the ship seemingly listing to one side.[284] On 12 September, both Ukrainian and Russian sources reported that Russian naval targets in Sevastopol had been struck by unconfirmed weaponry, damaging two military vessels, one of them reportedly a submarine.[285] Ukraine also reported that several oil and gas drilling platforms on the Black Sea held by Russia since 2015 had been retaken.[286]\nOn 21 September, Russia began missile strikes across Ukraine, damaging the country's energy facilities.[288] On 22 September, the US announced it would send long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine,[289] despite the reservations of some government officials.[290] The same day, the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence launched a missile strike on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea, killing several senior military officials.[291][292] In October 2023, it was reported that there was a growth of mutinies among Russian troops due to large amount of losses in Russian offensives around Avdiivka with a lack of artillery, food, water and poor command also being reported.[293]\nThe supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders.[294]\nUS general Mark Milley said that Ukraine's top military commander in the war, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, \"has emerged as the military mind his country needed. His leadership enabled the Ukrainian armed forces to adapt quickly with battlefield initiative against the Russians.\"[295] Russia began the invasion with no overall commander. The commanders of the four military districts were each responsible for their own offensives.[296]\nAfter initial setbacks, the commander of the Russian Southern Military District, Aleksandr Dvornikov. was placed in overall command on 8 April 2022,[297] while still responsible for his own campaign. Russian forces benefited from the centralization of command under Dvornikov,[298] but continued failures to meet expectations in Moscow led to multiple changes in overall command:[299]\ncommander of the Eastern Military District Gennadii Zhidko (Eastern Military District, 26May \u2013 8October 2022)\nOn 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were cancelled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol.[307] On 9 August 2022, large explosions were reported at Saky Air Base in western Crimea. Satellite imagery showed at least eight aircraft damaged or destroyed. Initial speculation attributed the explosions to long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces or an accident;[308] Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi claimed responsibility on 7 September.[309]\nRussia has carried out waves of strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems.[315]\nOn 15 November 2022, Russia fired 85 missiles at the Ukrainian power grid, causing major power outages in Kyiv and neighboring regions.[316] On 31 December, Putin in his New Year address called the war against Ukraine a \"sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants\" as missiles and drones rained down on Kiev.[317]\nOn 10 March 2023, The New York Times reported that Russia had used new hypersonic missiles in a massive missile attack on Ukraine. Such missiles are more effective in evading conventional Ukrainian anti-missile defenses that had previously proved useful against Russia's conventional, non-hypersonic missile systems.[318]\nBy 3 March, Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv scuttled the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, the flagship of the Ukrainian navy, to prevent its capture by Russian forces.[325] On 14 March, the Russian source RT reported that the Russian Armed Forces had captured about a dozen Ukrainian ships in Berdiansk, including the Polnocny-class landing shipYuri Olefirenko.[326] On 24 March, Ukrainian officials said that a Russian landing ship docked in Berdiansk \u2013 initially reported to be the Orsk and then its sister ship, the Saratov \u2013 was destroyed by a Ukrainian rocket attack.[122][327] In March 2022, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) sought to create a safe sea corridor for commercial vessels to leave Ukrainian ports.[328] On 27 March, Russia established a sea corridor 80 miles (130 km) long and 3 miles (4.8 km) wide through its Maritime Exclusion Zone, for the transit of merchant vessels from the edge of Ukrainian territorial waters south-east of Odesa.[329][330] Ukraine closed its ports at MARSEC level 3, with sea mines laid in port approaches, until the end to hostilities.[331]\nThe Russian cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, was, according to Ukrainian sources and a US senior official,[332] hit on 13 April by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, setting the ship afire. The Russian Defence Ministry said the warship had suffered serious damage from a munition explosion caused by a fire, and that its entire crew had been evacuated.[333] Pentagon spokesman John Kirby reported on 14 April that satellite images showed that the Russian warship had suffered a sizeable explosion onboard but was heading to the east for expected repairs and refitting in Sevastopol.[334] Later the same day, the Russian Ministry of Defence stated that the Moskva had sunk while under tow in rough weather.[335] On 15 April, Reuters reported that Russia launched an apparent retaliatory missile strike against the missile factory Luch Design Bureau in Kyiv where the Neptune missiles used in the Moskva attack were manufactured and designed.[336] On 5 May, a US official confirmed that the US gave \"a range of intelligence\" (including real-time battlefield targetingintelligence)[337] to assist in the sinking of the Moskva.[338]\nIn early May, Ukrainian forces launched counterattacks on Snake Island. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed to have repelled these counterattacks. Ukraine released footage of a Russian Serna-class landing craft being destroyed in the Black Sea near Snake Island by a Ukrainian drone.[339] The same day, a pair of Ukrainian Su-27s conducted a high-speed, low level bombing run on Russian-occupied Snake Island; the attack was captured on film by a Baykar Bayraktar TB2 drone.[340] On 1 June, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted that Ukraine's policy of mining its own harbours to impede Russia maritime aggression had contributed to the food export crisis, saying: \"If Kyiv solves the problem of demining ports, the Russian Navy will ensure the unimpeded passage of ships with grain to the Mediterranean Sea.\"[341] On 30 June 2022, Russia announced that it had withdrawn its troops from the island in a \"gesture of goodwill.\"[208] The withdrawal was later confirmed by Ukraine.[342]\nFour days into the invasion, President Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert, raising fears that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine, or a wider escalation of the conflict could occur.[343] Putin alluded in April to the use of nuclear weapons, and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said there was a \"real\" danger of a World War III.[344] On 14 April, CIA director William Burns said that \"potential desperation\" in the face of defeat could encourage President Putin to use tactical nuclear weapons.[345] In response to Russia's disregard of safety precautions during its occupation of the disabled former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl and its firing of missiles in the vicinity of the active Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Zelenskyy called on 26 April for an international discussion on Russia's use of nuclear resources, saying: \"no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has ... If Russia has forgotten what Chernobyl is, it means that global control over Russia's nuclear facilities, and nuclear technology is needed.\"[346] In August shelling around Zaporizhzhia power plant became a crisis, prompting an emergency inspection by the IAEA. Ukraine described the crisis nuclear terrorism by Russia.[347] On 19 September Biden warned of a \"consequential response from the U.S.\"[348] Before the United Nations on 21 September he criticized Putin's nuclear sabre-rattling, calling Putin was \"overt, reckless and irresponsible... A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"[349] In March 2023, Putin announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.[350]\nUkrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion by volunteering for territorial defence units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, building barriers like Czech hedgehogs,[351] and helping to transport refugees.[352] Responding to a call from Ukravtodor, Ukraine's transportation agency, civilians dismantled or altered road signs,[353] constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways.[354] Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops.[355] By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country. The Ukrainian military announced plans for a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence.[356]\nPeople physically blocked Russian military vehicles, sometimes forcing them to retreat.[355][357] The Russian soldiers' response to unarmed civilian resistance varied from reluctance to engage the protesters,[355] to firing into the air, to firing directly into crowds.[358] There have been mass detentions of Ukrainian protesters, and Ukrainian media has reported forced disappearances, mock executions, hostage-taking, extrajudicial killings, and sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian military.[359] To facilitate Ukrainian attacks, civilians reported Russian military positions via a Telegramchatbot and Diia, a Ukrainian government app previously used by citizens to upload official identity and medical documents. In response, Russian forces began destroying mobile phone network equipment, searching door-to-door for smartphones and computers, and in at least one case killed a civilian who had pictures of Russian tanks.[360]\nAs of 21 May 2022, Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine had 700,000 service members on active duty fighting the Russian invasion.[361] Ukraine withdrew soldiers and military equipment back to Ukraine over the course of 2022 that had been deployed to United Nations peacekeeping missions like MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[362]\nAccording to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2023, 31 percent of the world's population live in countries that are leaning towards or supportive of Russia, 30.7 percent live in neutral countries, and 36.2 percent live in countries that are against Russia in some way.[376]\nBy October 2022, three countries\u2014Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia\u2014had declared Russia a \"terrorist state.\"[377] On 1 August, Iceland became the first European country to close its embassy in Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.[378]\nThe invasion prompted Ukraine,[379]Finland and Sweden to officially apply for NATO membership.[380] Finland became a member of NATO in April 2023.[381]\nThe Kiel Institute tracked $155.9 billion from 41 countries and European Union institutions in financial, humanitarian, and military aid to Ukraine from 24 January 2022 to 24 February 2023.[382] NATO is coordinating and helping member states to provide billions of dollars in military equipment and financial aid to Ukraine.[383] The United States has provided the most military assistance, having committed over $29.3 billion from 24 February 2022 to 3 February 2023.[384][e] Many NATO allies, including Germany, have reversed past policies against providing offensive military aid in order to support Ukraine. The European Union, for the first time in its history, supplied lethal arms, and has provided \u20ac3.1 billion to Ukraine.[387] Bulgaria, a major manufacturer of Soviet-pattern weapons, has covertly supplied more than \u20ac2 billion worth of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, including a third of the ammunition needed by the Ukrainian military in the critical early phase of the invasion; Bulgaria also provides fuel supplies and has, at times, covered 40% of the fuel needed by the Ukrainian armed forces.[388]\nCountries on Russia's \"Unfriendly Countries List\" The list includes countries that have imposed sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.[389]\nForeign involvement in the invasion has been worldwide and extensive, with support ranging from foreign military sales and aid, foreign military involvement, foreign sanctions and ramifications, and including foreign condemnation and protest.[390] The US adopted a policy of \"no boots on the ground\" in Ukraine.[391] Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia for recognising the separatist people's republics as independent nations. When the attack began, many countries applied new sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy.[392] The sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, bank transfers, exports, and imports.[390]\nBelarus has allowed Russia to use its territory to stage part of the invasion, and to launch Russian missiles into Ukraine.[393]\nPolitico reported in March 2023 that Chinese state-owned weapons manufacturer Norinco shipped assault rifles, drone parts, and body armor to Russia between June and December 2022, with some shipments via third countries including Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.[394] According to the United States, Chinese ammunition has been used on battlefields in Ukraine.[395] In May 2023, the EU identified that Chinese and UAE firms were supplying weapon components to Russia.[396]\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes.[399] On 17 March 2023 the ICC issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, charging him with individual criminal responsibility in the abduction of children forcibly deported to Russia.[400] It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council[400] (the world's five principal nuclear powers).[401] Moscow has denied any involvement in war crimes, a response Vittorio Bufacchi of University College in Cork says \"has bordered on the farcical,\"[402] and its contention that the images coming out of Bucha were fabricated \"a disingenuous response born by delusional hubris, post-truth on overdrive, (that) does not merit to be taken seriously.\" Even the usually fractured United States Senate came together to call Putin a war criminal.[403] One of several efforts to document Russian war crimes concerns its repeated bombardment of markets and bread lines, destruction of basic infrastructure and attacks on exports and supply convoys, in a country where deliberate starvation of Ukrainians by Soviets the Holodomor still looms large in public memory.[404] Forcible deportation of populations, such as took place in Mariuopol, is another area of focus, since \"(f)orced deportations and transfers are defined both as war crimes under the Fourth Geneva Convention and Protocol II and Article 8 of the Rome Statute\u2014and as crimes against humanity\u2014under Article 7 of the Rome Statute. As both war crimes and crimes against humanity, they have several mechanisms for individual accountability, the International Criminal Court and also, at the individual state level, universal jurisdiction and Magnitsky sanctions legislation.[405]\nRussian and Ukrainian sources have both been said to inflate the casualty numbers for opposing forces and downplay their own losses for the sake of morale.[406] Leaked US documents say that \"under-reporting of casualties within the [Russian] system highlights the military's 'continuing reluctance' to convey bad news up the chain of command.\"[407] Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll.[408] Russia and Ukraine have each admitted suffering \"significant\"[409] and \"considerable\" losses, respectively.[410][411]BBC News has reported that Ukrainian Russian casualty figures included the injured.[412]\nThe numbers of civilian and military deaths have been as always impossible to determine precisely.[413]Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that neither it nor independent conflict monitors were able to verify Russian and Ukrainian claims of enemy losses and suspected that they were inflated.[414] On 12 October 2022, the independent Russian media project iStories, citing sources close to the Kremlin, reported that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, seriously wounded, or gone missing in Ukraine.[415]\nWhile combat deaths can be inferred from a variety of sources including satellite imagery of military action, civilian deaths can be more difficult. On 16 June 2022, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence told CNN that he believed that tens of thousands of Ukrainians had died, adding that he hoped that the total death toll was below 100,000.[416] In the destroyed city of Mariupol alone, Ukrainian officials believe that at least 25,000 have been killed,[417][418] and bodies were still being discovered in September 2022.[419] The mayor said over 10,000 and possibly as many as 20,000 civilians died in the siege of Mariupol and that Russian forces had brought mobile cremation equipment with them when they entered the city.[420][421] Researcher Dan Ciuriak from C.D. Howe Institute in August 2022 estimates the number of killed Mariupol civilians at 25,000,[422] and an investigation by AP from the end of 2022 gives a number of up to 75,000 killed civilians in Mariupol area alone.[423][424]AFP says that \"a key gap in casualty counts is the lack of information from Russian-occupied places like the port city of Mariupol, where tens of thousands of civilians are believed to have died\".[425] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports similar issues and believed that the true civilian casualty numbers were significantly higher than it has been able to confirm.[426]\nOfficial and estimated numbers of prisoners of war (POW) have varied.[437] On 24 February Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of 74th Guards from Kemerovo Oblast had surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and tasked with killing Ukrainians.[438] Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers by 2 March 2022,[439] while Ukraine said it held 562 Russian soldiers as of 20 March.[440] It also released one soldier for five of its own and exchanged another nine for the detained mayor of Melitopol.[441]\nUkrainian soldiers released during the exchange between Ukraine and Russia on 6 May 2023\nOn 24 March 2022, 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russians and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged.[442] On 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged[443] for an unknown number of Russian troops.[444]The Independent on 9 June 2022 cited an intelligence estimate of more than 5,600 Ukrainian soldiers captured, while the Russian servicemen held prisoner fell to 550 from 900 in April after several prisoner exchanges.\nAn 25 August 2022 report by the Humanitarian Research Lab of the Yale School of Public Health identified some 21 filtration camps or Ukrainian \"civilians, POWs, and other personnel\" in the vicinity of Donetsk oblast. Imaging of one of these, Olenivka prison, found two sites with disturbed earth consistent with \"potential graves.\"[445] Kaveh Khoshnood, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said: \"Incommunicado detention of civilians is more than a violation of international humanitarian law\u2014it represents a threat to the public health of those currently in the custody of Russia and its proxies.\" Conditions described by freed prisoners include confinement include exposure, insufficient access to sanitation, food and water, cramped conditions, electrical shocks and physical assault.[445]\nIn March 2023, UN human rights commissioner Volker T\u00fcrk reported that more than 90% of the Ukrainian POWs interviewed by his office, which could only include those who were released from Russia, said in Russia \"they were tortured or ill-treated, notably in penitentiary facilities, including through so-called \u2013 it is an awful phrase \u2013 'welcoming beatings' on their arrival, as well as frequent acts of torture throughout detention.\"[446]\nIn April 2023, several videos started circulating on different websites purportedly showing Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soldiers.[447] Zelensky compared Russian soldiers to \"beasts\" after the footage was circulated.[448] Russian officials opened an investigation of the footage shortly thereafter.[449]\nThe humanitarian impact of the invasion has been extensive and has included negative impacts on international food supplies and the 2022 food crises.[450] An estimated 6.6 million Ukrainians were internally displaced by August 2022, and about the same number were refugees in other countries.[451] The invasion has devastated the cultural heritage of Ukraine,[452] with over 500 Ukrainian cultural heritage sites, including cultural centers, theatres, museums, and churches, affected by \"Russian aggression.\" Ukraine's Minister of Culture called it cultural genocide.[453] Deliberate destruction and looting of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites in this way is considered a war crime.[454][better source needed]\nThe Russian attacks on civilians, causing mass civilian casualties and displacement, have been characterized as genocide and democide.[455] On the 15th of September 2023, a U.N.-mandated investigative body presented their findings that Russian occupiers had tortured Ukrainians so brutally that some of their victims died, and forced families to listen as they raped women next door.[456] The commission has previously said that violations committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, including the use of torture, may constitute crimes against humanity.[457]\nThe war caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s;[458][459] the UN described it as the fastest growing such crisis since World War II.[460] As Russia built up military forces along the Ukrainian border, many neighbouring governments and aid organisations prepared for a mass displacement event in the weeks before the invasion. In December 2021, the Ukrainian defence minister estimated that an invasion could force three to five million people to flee their homes.[461]\nIn the first week of the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine; this subsequently reached over eight million by 31 January 2023.[462][463] On 20 May, NPR reported that, following a significant influx of foreign military equipment into Ukraine, a significant number of refugees are seeking to return to regions of Ukraine which are relatively isolated from the invasion front in south-eastern Ukraine.[464] However, by 3 May, another 8 million people were displaced inside Ukraine.[465]\nMost refugees were women, children, elderly, or disabled.[466] Most male Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from Ukraine as part of mandatory conscription,[467] unless they were responsible for the financial support of three or more children, single fathers, or were the parent/guardian of children with disabilities.[468] Many Ukrainian men, including teenagers, opted to remain in Ukraine voluntarily to join the resistance.[469]\nAccording to the UN High Commission for Refugees as of 13 May 2022, there were 3,315,711 refugees in Poland, 901,696 in Romania, 594,664 in Hungary, 461,742 in Moldova, 415,402 in Slovakia, and 27,308 in Belarus, while Russia reported it had received over 800,104 refugees.[470] By 13 July 2022, over 390,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in the Czech Republic, where the average refugee was a woman accompanied by one child. These refugees were twice as likely to have a college degree as the Czech population as a whole.[471] Turkey has been another significant destination, registering more than 58,000 Ukrainian refugees as of 22 March, and more than 58,000 as of 25 April.[472] The EU invoked the Temporary Protection Directive for the first time in its history, granting Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years.[473] Britain has accepted 146,379 refugees, as well as extending the ability to remain in the UK for 3 years with broadly similar entitlements as the EU, three years residency and access to state welfare and services.[474]\nAccording to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russia has engaged in \"massive deportation\" of over 1.3 million Ukrainian civilians, potentially constituting crimes against humanity.[475] The OSCE and Ukraine have accused Russia of forcibly moving civilians to filtration camps in Russian-held territory, and then into Russia. Ukrainian sources have compared this policy to Soviet-era population transfers and Russian actions in the Chechen War of Independence.[476] For instance, as of 8 April, Russia claimed to have evacuated about 121,000 Mariupol residents to Russia.[476] Also, on 19 October, Russia announced the forced deportation of 60,000 civilians from areas around the line of contact in Kherson oblast.[477]RIA Novosti and Ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to various centers in cities in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine,[478] from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of Russia.[479] In April, Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said that Russia planned to build \"concentration camps\" for Ukrainians in western Siberia, and likely planned to force prisoners to build new cities in Siberia.[480][i]\nBoth Russia and Ukraine faced the prospect of significant population decline even before the war, having among the lowest fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration. It is the first time that two countries with an average age above 40 have gone to war against each other.[482] Russia had a fighting-age (18- to 40-year-old) male population more than four times higher than Ukraine's and slightly higher birth rates, while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in Ukraine.[483]\nSeveral sources have pointed out that the war is considerably worsening Ukraine's demographic crisis, making significant shrinking very likely.[484] A July 2023 study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies stated that \"[r]egardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation, Ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war. Even in 2040 it will have only about 35 million inhabitants, around 20% fewer than before the war (2021: 42.8 million) and the decline in the working-age population is likely to be the most severe and far-reaching.\" The study took different scenarios, from a \"best case\" (end of the war in 2023 without much further escalation) to a \"worst case\" (end of the war in 2025 with further escalation) into account. Flight from war affected especially the southern and eastern regions and especially educated women of child-bearing age and their children. With an estimate of more than 20% of refugees not returning, study author Maryna Tverdostup concluded that long-term shrinking and will significantly impair the conditions for reconstruction.[485]\nSince February 2022, hundreds of thousands of Russians emigrated; estimates range from 370,000 to over 820,000. Combined with mobilization, this possibly removed roughly half a million to one million working-age males from Russia's population.[486] Studies report that this will have a demographic effect, especially in Russia, that lasts much longer than the conflict, and Putin's time in office.[487]\nThey come from different walks of life. Some are journalists like us, but there are also IT experts, designers, artists, academics, lawyers, doctors, PR specialists, and linguists. Most are under 50. Many share western liberal values and hope Russia will be a democratic country one day. Some are LGBTQ+. Sociologists studying the current Russian emigration say there is evidence that those leaving are younger, better educated and wealthier than those staying. More often they are from bigger cities.\nAccording to Johannes Wachs, \"The exodus of skilled human capital, sometimes called brain drain, out of Russia may have a significant effect on the course of the war and the Russian economy in the long run.\"[489]\nAccording to one survey, around 15 percent of those who left returned to Russia, either permanently or to settle their affairs.[490]\nBased on a preliminary assessment, the war has inflicted USD 51 billion in environmental damage in Ukraine; according to a report by the Yale School of the Environment, some 687,000 tons of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling, while nearly 1,600 tons of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water. Hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 70 acres of soil, and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible.[491] Around 30% of Ukraine's land is now littered with explosives and more than 2.4 million hectares of forest have been damaged.[492]\nAccording to Netherlands-based peace organization PAX, Russia's \"deliberate targeting of industrial and energy infrastructure\" has caused \"severe\" pollution, and the use of explosive weapons has left \"millions of tonnes\" of contaminated debris in cities and towns.[493] In early June 2023, the Kakhovka Dam, under Russian occupation, was damaged, causing flooding and triggering warnings of an \"ecological disaster.\"[494]\nThe Ukrainian government, international observers and journalists have described the damage as ecocide.[495] The Ukrainian government is investigating more crimes against the environment and ecocide (a crime in Ukraine).[496] Zelenskyy has met with prominent European figures (Heidi Hautala, Margot Wallstrom, Mary Robinson and Greta Thunberg) to discuss the environmental damage and how to prosecute it.[497]\nPeace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on 28 February, 3 March, and 7 March 2022, in the Gomel Region on the Belarus\u2013Ukraine border, with further talks held on 10 March in Turkey and a fourth round of negotiations beginning 14 March.[499]\nOn 13 July, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that peace talks were frozen and Ukraine must first recover the lost territories in the east of the country, before negotiations come.[500] On 19 July, former Russian President and current Deputy head of the Russian Security CouncilDmitry Medvedev, said: \"Russia will achieve all its goals. There will be peace \u2013 on our terms.\"[501]\nPutin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that any peace plan could only proceed from Ukraine's recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the regions it annexed from Ukraine in September 2022.[502][503] By 29 December, following the Russian declared annexation of multiple Ukrainian oblasts, hopes for Ukrainian peace talks with Russia dimmed significantly with Russia taking a hardline position that the full Russian occupation of the four oblasts would be non-negotiable under any circumstances.[504] In addition, Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine would not hold peace talks with Russia while Putin was president and signed a decree to ban such talks.[505] In January 2023, Putin's spokesperson Peskov said that \"there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine.\"[506]\nIn May 2023, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said peace negotiations to end the Russo-Ukrainian War were \"not possible at this moment\", saying it was clear that Russia and Ukraine were \"completely absorbed in this war\" and each \"convinced that they can win.\"[507]\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said that the peace plans presented by China, Brazil and Indonesia are attempts at mediation on behalf of Russia, and \"they all currently want to be mediators on Russia's side. That's why this sort of mediation currently doesn't fit for us at all because they aren't impartial.\"[508] He said that Ukraine was willing to accept China as a mediator only if Beijing could convince Russia to withdraw from all the territories it had occupied.[509]\n^ abThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were Russian-controlled puppet states that declared their independence from Ukraine in May 2014. In 2022 they received international recognition from each other, Russia, Syria and North Korea, and some other partially recognised states. On 30 September 2022, after a referendum, Russia declared it had formally annexed both entities.\n^By early September 2022 the US had given 126 M777 howitzer cannons and over 800,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition for them.[385] By January 2023 the US had donated 250,000 more 155 mm shells to Ukraine. The US is producing 14,000 155 mm shells monthly and plans to increase production to 90,000 shells per month by 2025.[386]\n^See here for a detailed breakdown of civilian deaths by oblast, according to Ukrainian authorities.\n^The DPR said 1,285 civilians were killed and 4,243 wounded between 1 January 2022 and 22 June 2023,[431][432] of which 8 died and 23 were wounded between 1 January and 25 February 2022,[433] leaving a total of 1,277 killed and 4,220 wounded in the period of the Russian invasion.\n^Most likely, new cities meant new industrial cities in Siberia, the construction plans of which were announced by Shoigu in the fall of 2021.[481]\nEvans, Michael (5 April 2008). \"President tells summit he wants security and friendship\". The Times. p. 46. President Putin, in a bravura performance before the world's media at the end of the Nato summit, warned President Bush and other alliance leaders that their plan to expand eastwards to Ukraine and Georgia \"didn't contribute to trust and predictability in our relations.\nWilson, Andrew (23 December 2021). \"Russia and Ukraine: 'One People' as Putin Claims?\".

        "context": "\nFollowing shareholder approval of the acquisition, the merger was reviewed by several national anti-trust bodies, with early approvals granted by the European Commission and China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), among others. The United States' Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued formal challenges to the acquisition. Sony also criticized the merger, concerned that Microsoft would make the lucrative Call of Duty franchise exclusive to the Xbox platform, though Microsoft committed to non-exclusivity through 2033. The FTC withdrew its request after courts did not find their anti-trust compelling to block the merger, while Microsoft offered to offload its cloud gaming support for Activision Blizzard's games for ten years to Ubisoft to appease the CMA.\nMicrosoft is a dominant player in computing software, and also makes the Xbox line of game consoles and operates Xbox Game Studios, a collection of developers to create first party titles. In March 2021, Microsoft closed on its acquisition of ZeniMax Media and Bethesda Softworks for an estimated $7.5 billion, making it one of the largest video game acquisitions by that time.[9]\nOn January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal, or approximately $95 per share. Activision Blizzard's stock price jumped nearly 40% that day in pre-market trading. The deal would make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world and the largest headquartered in the Americas, behind Chinese company Tencent and the Japanese conglomerate Sony. If closed, it would also be the most expensive video game-related acquisition in to date.[10]Goldman Sachs will serve as the financial advisor to Microsoft, and Allen & Company will be Activision's financial advisors. Simpson Thacher will serve as legal advisor for Microsoft while Skadden will serve as legal advisor for Activision.[11] The deal has been approved by both companies' board of directors and is expected to close in 2023 following international government regulatory review of the action.[12][13] Upon completion of the deal, Activision Blizzard would be a sibling entity to Xbox Game Studios under a new Microsoft Gaming division with Phil Spencer as its lead. The deal would also allow Microsoft to offer Activision Blizzard games on its Xbox Game Pass service.[13] Spencer also spoke about reviving some older Activision Blizzard franchises he himself enjoyed, mentioning series such as King's Quest, Guitar Hero and Hexen: Beyond Heretic.[14]\nKotick stated that he, Spencer, and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella have had discussions in 2021 on their concern of the power of Tencent, NetEase, Apple, Inc. and Google, and that Activision Blizzard lacked the computation expertise in machine learning and data analytics that would be necessary to compete with these companies. According to Kotick, this led to the idea of Microsoft, which does have those capabilities, acquiring Activision Blizzard at an attractive price point.[15] Spencer further had stated that Microsoft's intent with the acquisition is access to Activision's mobile games, which would include those by its King division such as Candy Crush Saga. He said that while there are 200 million game console users worldwide, the mobile market reaches over 3 billion people.[16] In a statement released on Activision Blizzard's investor website, the company said its industry is the \"most dynamic and exciting category of entertainment across all platforms\" and that gaming will be the forefront of the development of the emerging metaverse. Some journalists saw this acquisition, and Microsoft's March 2021 acquisition of Bethesda Softworks, as a bid to compete against Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook.[17][12][13]\nThe announcement had come in the wake of events related to California Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Activision Blizzard, a lawsuit raised in July 2021 accusing the company of sexual harassment, employment discrimination and retaliation on the part of Activision Blizzard.[18][19] Allegations had expanded by November 2021 to include actions that Activision Blizzard's CEO Bobby Kotick had done.[20][21] The timing of the acquisition was reported by The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News to be in response to the ongoing DFEH lawsuit. Reports from both newspapers stated that Activision Blizzard had been considering a buyout from other companies, including Facebook parent company Meta Platforms, due to the weaker than expected financial performance of their latest game releases and production delays.[22][23][24] Based on SEC filings related to the merger, Microsoft approached Activision Blizzard again in the days immediately following the November 2021 Wall Street Journal report regarding a buyout.[25] While Kotick had been hesitant about selling the company, the board had gone ahead with the deal as they continued to fear the ongoing impact of the lawsuit while Kotick remained on the board.[22][24] The buyout would provide a graceful exit for Kotick in the future, ranging in $252.2\u2013292.9 million over most scenarios.[22][24][26]\nAccording to official announcements, under the deal Kotick will remain the CEO of Activision Blizzard,[27][28][29][30] and is expected to keep the position while the deal goes through regulatory processes, as Activision Blizzard remains independent from Microsoft until the deal closes.[31] According to The Wall Street Journal, Kotick \"will depart once the deal closes\" under Microsoft's management, while Kotick said in an interview that he has an interest in remaining in the company.[20][32][33][15] Microsoft has yet to speak directly about the Activision Blizzard lawsuit following news of the acquisition, however the company announced a week prior that it would be reviewing its own sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies.[34]\nActivision Blizzard's shareholders approved of the acquisition near-unanimously in April 2022.[35]\nThe deal was set to close by July 18, 2023, after which Microsoft would owe Activision Blizzard $3 billion if the deal failed to close. However, the companies would be able to mutually extend the deadline, or if the deal expired, renegotiate the terms.[36] By this date, as described below, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, after an initial ruling denying the merger, had extended their deadline to August 29, 2023, to rule on a new proposal by Microsoft. It was later extended their deadline to the same day as the acquisition closing date to provide its Phase 1 investigation of the merger. The companies agreed to extend the close of the acquisition until October 18, 2023, as to resolve the CMA issue.[37] Following the CMA's approval of the revised terms on October 13, 2023, Microsoft completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard the same day.[38]\n^The FTC has challenged the merger, but has failed to gain an injunction to stop the merger in a federal court on July 11, 2023, nor an emergency stay from the circuit court, allowing Microsoft to close the acquisition before the resolution of the trial.[44]\n^The CMA blocked the original deal, but approved the proposed restructure in which Microsoft divested the cloud gaming rights of Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft.\n^The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had initially opened an informal review of the acquisition, but after Microsoft closed the deal on October 13, 2023, and approval from other international regulatory agencies, the Commission discontinued any review and plans no action against the acquisition\nIn the United States, the acquisition was reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rather than traditionally by the U.S. Department of Justice, as the agency had raised more concerns over mergers and acquisitions in the Big Tech sector in the last decade.[62] U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Cory Booker expressed their concerns about the merger to the FTC as part of the FTC's investigation, saying that both companies have \"failed to protect the rights and dignity of their workers\" and that the merger should be opposed if \"the transaction is likely to enhance monopoly power and worsen the negotiating position between workers and the parties.\"[63] The FTC formally stated its intention to block the acquisition as proposed on December 8, 2022. The FTC expressed concern that the acquisition would harm consumers of Activision Blizzard's games and give Microsoft too much control of certain parts of the industry, such as cloud gaming. The FTC also pointed to the acquisition of Zenimax, which the FTC claimed that Microsoft had agreed to a concession from the European Union to not make their games exclusive to the Xbox and later broke.[64][65] In a statement made to Axios' Stephan Totilo, the European Commission stated that they had cleared Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax unconditionally as they saw no \"material impact\" on the gaming market even if Microsoft made Zenimax's titles exclusive.[66]\nMicrosoft responded to the FTC's complaint that Sony itself is one of the largest platforms with exclusive titles that contractually cannot be made for Xbox. They also said they still plan to offer content for multiplayer Bethesda games like Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 for all platforms to avoid undercutting the playerbase. Microsoft also initially challenged the constitutionality of the FTC due to the ability for the Commissioner to be removed by the President at will, and their use of administrative law judges to initially review cases, both which have founding in recent Supreme Court cases,[67] but removed this language in an amended response, sticking to the video game market.[68] In February 2023, the FTC denied a request by Sony to drop a subpoena filed by Microsoft, requesting internal documentation from Sony related to their third-party exclusivity deals.[69]\nThe FTC requested a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block the merger on June 12, 2023. The FTC stated that Microsoft and Activision Blizzard \"have represented in the past that they cannot close their deal due to antitrust reviews of the transaction in other jurisdictions. But Microsoft and Activision have not provided assurances that they will maintain that position.\"[70]\nThe court granted the temporary restraining order on June 13, 2023,[71] while a hearing to determine if a preliminary injunction on the deal should be granted was held from June 22 to 30, 2023, before Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. Microsoft said that if the injunction should be granted, they may consider abandoning the deal which they described as being a \"three-year administrative nightmare\".[72] During the hearing, the FTC was focused on the effect of Call of Duty in the competitive market, console exclusivity, and the impact of the nascent cloud gaming field.[73]\nJudge Corley denied to apply a permanent injunction on July 11, 2023, lifting the temporary restraining order to allow Microsoft to proceed to close the deal, though the case will continue to trial later. Corley wrote, \"For the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.\"[74] The FTC formally filed an appeal to Judge Corley's denial to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on July 12, 2023.[75] The FTC also filed a separate motion to Corley on July 13 arguing for another injunction until the Ninth Circuit had time to decide to stay Corley's previous ruling, but she denied that motion.[76] The Ninth Circuit court denied the emergency appeal to block the merger on July 14, 2023.[77]\nThe FTC formally withdrew its challenge to the acquisition on July 20, 2023, though they have announced their intent to refile at a later time.[78] The FTC reopened its case against the merger on September 27, 2023, though was unable to block the merger from occurring.[79]\nAfter receiving a formal notification by Microsoft on September 30, 2022, the European Commission began its first phase review of the acquisition under the EU merger law.[80][81] The Commission sent out a questionnaire to several game industry firms to ask them about the potential impact of the acquisition on their livelihood, including if Microsoft does opt to lock rivals out of Activision games in the future.[82] The Commission announced on November 8, 2022, that it will conduct an additional review of the merger \"to ensure that the gaming ecosystem remains vibrant to the benefit of users in a sector that is evolving at a fast pace.\".[83]\nThe EC filed its formal complaint against the acquisition on February 3, 2023. The EC said they were considered that Microsoft may be \"incentivized to block access to Activision's popular Call of Duty franchise\", which could lead to \"reduce competition in the markets for the distribution of console and PC video games, leading to higher prices, lower quality and less innovation for console game distributors, which may, in turn, be passed on to consumers.\"[84] Microsoft met with the EC regulators on February 21, 2023, announcing that they had secured a ten-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to that platform alongside the Xbox release, as well as a separate ten-year agreement providing Call of Duty and other first-party Microsoft games with Nvidia as part of their GeForce Now streaming service.[85]\nThe Commission approved the acquisition on May 15, 2023. Among concessions that Microsoft had made were the numerous deals to allow Activision Blizzard games to be played on cloud gaming service, believing this would help grow that sector. The Commission dismissed the concerns about platform exclusivity as Microsoft had reason why it would not be financially viable to withhold Call of Duty from other platforms. And even if they did, Sony had the capacity with their own studios to compete fairly.[86] Ahead of the October 2023 closure, the Commission affirmed that the changes made to appease the UK regulators remained sufficient from their side, and no further review of the acquisition was needed.[87]\nThe UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated its intent to perform a higher-level review of the acquisition in August 2022. The phase 1 ruling, issued on September 1, 2022, said that the merger \"may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within a market or markets in the United Kingdom\".[88][89] Preliminary findings of phase 2 of the investigation was reported on February 8, 2023, concluding that the acquisition \"could result in higher prices, fewer choices, and less innovation for UK gamers\", as well as less competition in the console and cloud gaming spaces. The CMA has recommended that Activision should at least divest the Call of Duty franchise.[90] However, following Microsoft's commitments to ensure the release of Call of Duty on multiple platforms for ten years, in association with meeting other regulatory bodies, the CMA changed its stance by late March 2023. In its new statement, the CMA said \"While the CMA's original analysis indicated that this strategy would be profitable under most scenarios, new data (which provides better insight into the actual purchasing behaviour of CoD gamers) indicates that this strategy would be significantly loss-making under any plausible scenario.\"[91]\nThe CMA formally ruled against the merger on April 26, 2023. Among various reasons, CMA stated that Microsoft had already a strong position in cloud gaming, and the merger would only strengthen that position. CMA also stated that Microsoft's concessions related to the 10-year contracts for Call of Duty on other platforms were not enough to satisfy their concerns, and doubted that Microsoft would be able to port Call of Duty onto the Nintendo Switch. The CMA further prevented Microsoft to initiate any acquisition of Activision again in the future without seeking pre-clearance from the CMA.[92] Microsoft filed its appeal to the decision by the end of May, outlining five points of rebuttal mostly around the CMA's assessment of the cloud gaming market and Microsoft's current position within it.[93][94] The appeals process could extend the potential completion of the merger to the end of 2023 if not into 2024.[95][96]\nThe CMA's decision had become subject to political debate within the UK, particularly after the European Commission approved the deal. Current prime minister Rishi Sunak aimed to make the UK the tech industry leader in the European region, and the CMA's blockage ran against that position. Representatives of the CMA have defended their position to members of Parliament, standing their ground that the proposed merger would give Microsoft too much of an advantage.[97]\nFollowing the decision from Judge Corley to deny the injunction for the FTC, Microsoft, Activision/Blizzard, and the CMA have agreed and asked to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) to pause their legal battle to negotiate.[98] The CAT adjourned the hearing on July 21, 2023. The CMA announced on July 14, 2023, that they would be extending their investigation, originally set to close before the July 18, 2023, acquisition deadline, for six weeks to August 29, 2023, pending review of a new proposal that Microsoft had submitted to the CMA.[99][36]\nLater in August 2023, Microsoft announced that it would sell the stream rights to the Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft via its own cloud service Ubisoft+ for the next 15 years, contingent on the successful completion of the merger,[100] a move that had been projected to appease the CMA.[101] The CMA stated that while this appeared to meet their concerns, they will still review the deal through a Phase 1 investigation, which is expected to complete by the extended merger deadline, October 18, 2023.[100] The CMA stated on September 22, 2023, that they considered the revised acquisition to be provisionally approved, as while the sale of the stream right satisfied the group's primary concern, there were some limited residual concerns to resolve before giving full approval by October 13.[102] The CMA approved the revised terms for acquisition on October 13, 2023.[103]\nThe New York City Employees' Retirement System, which are shareholders of Activision Blizzard, sued the company in April 2022, arguing that the company had made the acquisition deal quickly with Microsoft as to try to cover up the misdoings of Kotick that had been uncovered as part of the ongoing DCEH lawsuit and escape any liability.[112]\nSjunde AP-Fonden, a Swedish-government run pension fund with investments in Activision-Blizzard, filed a lawsuit in November 2022 within the U.S. court system against Microsoft and Activision-Blizzard of collusion in establishing the deal. The lawsuit asserts that because of Activision-Blizzard's weakened position resulting from the workplace harassment lawsuit from the California DFEH, that Microsoft negotiated with Kotick and Activision-Blizzard to buy the company at a reduced price. The lawsuit also named Kotick for using the deal to cover up his alleged misconduct related to the DFEH suit.[113]\nA group of gamers filed suit against Microsoft in December 2022 to block the merger under the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 which enables consumers to file such lawsuits. The suit argues that should the merger go through, Microsoft's combined power would disrupt the video game marketplace, giving Microsoft the capability to outpace competitors and take a stronger hold.[114] Microsoft failed to have the case dismissed in January 2023, and arguments related to a preliminary discussion was presented to the judge in March 2023.[115] The judge dismissed the suit in March 2023, citing that the gamers had not shown sufficient evidence of harm to the industry should the merger go through.[116] The gamers refiled their suit, using additional evidence and claims provided to them by Sony, in April 2023.[117] The same federal court denied a preliminary injunction in the refiled case in May 2023, stating the plaintiffs failed to show how they would be damaged by the merger.[118] The group subsequently filed an emergency request at the Supreme Court of the United States on July 16, 2023, to halt the merger,[119] but this request was denied by the Court the next day.[120]\nSeveral Activision Blizzard employees have expressed cautious optimism with respect to the deal, with the ABK Workers Alliance, a group of employees pushing for unionization in the wake of the DFEH lawsuit, saying the acquisition did \"not change the goals\" of the Alliance.[121][122][123] A report by Business Insider suggested several Microsoft employees have raised their concern on the deal with respect to the sexual harassment scandals and Activision Blizzard workplace culture, hoping for \"concrete steps to make sure we aren't introducing a dangerous and unwelcome culture.\"[124] On January 19, 2022, World Bank president David Malpass criticized the acquisition, contrasting the acquisition price with the smaller amount of bond financing available to developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.[125] The AFL-CIO supports the merger due to Microsoft signing a labor neutrality pact between the Communications Workers of America (who also supports the merger) and the company that was signed following the announcement of the proposed acquisition.[126][127]\nConcerns on Microsoft's potential ownership of the Call of Duty franchise, which has sold over 400 million units by April 2021 and considered one of the most valuable properties within the video game industry,[128] have been raised by Sony Interactive Entertainment and regulators. Shortly after the acquisition announcements, Sony had stated that they expect Microsoft to honor all of Activision Blizzard's publishing agreements for multiplatform games, assuring that Call of Duty would remain available on the PlayStation platform and not made a console-exclusive title. Spencer and Microsoft president Brad Smith reassured that Microsoft will continue these existing agreements and expressed their desire to keep Call of Duty and other popular Activision Blizzard games on PlayStation beyond the terms of these agreements, as well as explore the opportunity to bring these games to the Nintendo consoles.[129][130][131][132]\nAround September 2022, Xbox head Phil Spencer said Microsoft had written a letter to Sony in January, affirming their commitment to maintain Call of Duty on the PlayStation \"several years\" beyond the current contractual agreements set before the acquisition, which are said to last until 2024.[133][134] Spencer said their offer to Sony \"goes well beyond typical gaming industry agreements\".[135] Sony's president Jim Ryan responded to Spencer by stating that in their commitment, Microsoft only stated their intent to keep Call of Duty for three more years beyond the current contract terms, and that \"their proposal was inadequate on many levels and failed to take account of the impact on our gamers. We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality Call of Duty experience, and Microsoft's proposal undermines this principle.\"[135] Public documents filed as part of the UK's investigation revealed that Microsoft would be limited by prior contractual agreements between Sony and Activision to provide Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass for several years.[136]\nMicrosoft stated that it had written to Sony on November 11, 2022, to agree to a ten-year commitment for Call of Duty to remain non-exclusive to Xbox.[137] Sony further stated that Microsoft's intent with the acquisition is to remove Sony and PlayStation from competition with Microsoft and instead have the PlayStation platform more comparable to the Nintendo Switch, which Sony stated is based on taking up a family-friendly position and not attempting to compete with adult-rated games like Call of Duty.[138] Besides the commitment to Sony, Microsoft also had committed in December 2022 to a similar ten-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo's platforms, further attempting to prove to regulators they had no intent to make the title exclusive to Xbox or Windows.[139] By July 16, 2023, Sony signed to a \"binding agreement\" with Microsoft that committed to keeping Call of Duty on the PlayStation family.[140]\nA number of indie publishers and developers including Curve Games, Finji, Iam8bit, and Strange Scaffold expressed support for the deal according to 2023 court filings.[141]",

The biblical name for this holiday is Yom Teruah (\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4\u200e, Y\u014dm T\u0259r\u016b\u02bf\u0101, lit. \"day of shouting/blasting\"). It is the first of the JewishHigh Holy Days (\u05d9\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, Y\u0101m\u012bm N\u014dr\u0101\u02be\u012bm, \"Days of Awe\"), as specified by Leviticus 23:23\u201325,[1] that occur in the late summer/early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere. Rosh Hashanah begins a ten-day period of penitence culminating in Yom Kippur, as well as beginning the cycle of autumnal religious festivals running through Sukkot and ending in Shemini Atzeret in Israel and in Simchat Torah everywhere else.\nRosh Hashanah is a two-day observance and celebration that begins on the first day of Tishrei, which is the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year. In contrast to the ecclesiastical lunar new year on the first day of the first month Nisan, the spring Passover month which marks Israel's exodus from Egypt, Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the civil year, according to the teachings of Judaism, and is the traditional anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman according to the Hebrew Bible, as well as the initiation of humanity's role in God's world.\nRosh Hashanah customs include sounding the shofar (a hollowed-out ram's horn), as prescribed in the Torah, following the prescription of the Hebrew Bible to \"raise a noise\" on Yom Teruah. Its rabbinical customs include attending synagogue services and reciting special liturgy about teshuva, as well as enjoying festive meals. Eating symbolic foods, such as apples dipped in honey, hoping to evoke a sweet new year, is an ancient tradition recorded in the Talmud.[2]\nRosh is the Hebrew word for \"head\", ha is the definite article (\"the\"), and shana means year. Thus Rosh HaShanah means \"head of the year\", referring to the Jewish day of new year.[3][4]\nThe term Rosh Hashanah in its current meaning does not appear in the Torah. Leviticus 23:24[5] refers to the festival of the first day of the seventh month as zikhron teru'ah (\"a memorial of blowing [of horns]\") Numbers 29:1[6] calls the festival yom teru'ah (\"day of blowing [the horn]\").\nThe term rosh hashanah appears once in the Bible (Ezekiel 40:1),[7] where it has a different meaning: either generally the time of the \"beginning of the year\", or possibly a reference to Yom Kippur,[8] or to the month of Nisan.[a][12]\nThe origin of the Hebrew New Year is connected to the beginning of the economic year in the agricultural societies of the ancient Near East.[13] The New Year was the beginning of the cycle of sowing, growth, and harvest; the harvest was marked by its own set of major agricultural festivals.[13] The Semites generally set the beginning of the new year in autumn, while other ancient civilizations chose spring for that purpose, such as the Persians or Greeks; the primary reason was agricultural in both cases, the time of sowing the seed and bringing in the harvest.[13]\nSome scholars posit a connection between the Babylonian festival Akitu and Rosh Hashanah, as there are some striking similarities. The Akitu festival of Ur was celebrated in the beginning of Nisanu (first month), which lasted at least five days, and again in Tashritu, the seventh month, which lasted eleven days.[14] Akitu was also strongly tied to the creation myth of Enuma Elish and the victory of Marduk over the sea monster Tiamat, and the creation of the universe from her corpse. Similarly it is said that the world was created on Rosh Hashanah.[15]\nRosh Hashanah marks the start of the numbering of a new year in the Hebrew calendar. In Jewish law, four different \u2033New Years\u2033 are observed: Rosh Hashanah (the first of Tishrei), the first of Nisan (when the Exodus began), the first of Elul, and Tu BiShvat (the fifteenth of Shevat). Each one delineates the beginning of a \"year\" for different legal or ecclesiastical purposes. The Talmudic distinctions among the \"New Years\" are discussed in the tractate on Rosh Hashanah.[4] Rosh Hashanah is the new year for calculating ordinary calendar years, Sabbatical years, Jubilee years, and dates inscribed on legal deeds and contracts. Rosh Hashanah commemorates the creation of Man.[16] In Jewish practice, the months are numbered starting with the spring month of Nisan, making Tishrei the seventh month; Rosh Hashanah, the first day of the new calendar year, is also actually the first day of the seventh month.[17]\nThe second of these \"New Years\", the first of the lunar month Nisan (usually corresponds to the months March\u2013April in the Gregorian calendar) is the beginning of the ecclesiastical year; the months are numbered beginning with Nisan. It marks the start of the year for the three Jewish pilgrimages.[18] Its injunction is expressly stated in the Hebrew Bible: \"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months\" (Exodus 12:2).[19] Their injunction is expressly stated in the Hebrew Bible: \"Three times in the year you shall keep a feast unto me... the feast of unleavened bread (Passover)... the feast of harvest (Shavuot)... and the feast of ingathering (Sukkot) which is at the departing of the year\" (Exodus 23:14\u201316).[20] \"At the departing of the year\" implies that the new year begins here.[21] It is also when a new year is added to the reign of Jewish kings.\nThe third \"New Year,\" the first of Elul, the new year for animals, began the religious taxation period for tithing animals in Biblical times. Elul corresponds to the Gregorian August/September, after the spring birthings, when it was relatively simple to count the number of animals in herds.\nThe fourth \"New Year,\" Tu Bishvat, the new year for trees, began the religious taxation period for tithing fruits and nuts from trees. Shevat corresponds to the Gregorian January/February, the end of the Mediterranean wet season when the majority of the year's rainfall had occurred. Taking fruit or nuts from a tree younger than three years old, with the birthday counted as Tu Bishvat, was prohibited.\nThe Mishnah contains the second known reference to Rosh Hashanah as the \"day of judgment\" (Yom haDin).[22] In the Talmud tractate on Rosh Hashanah, it states that three books of account are opened on Rosh Hashanah, wherein the fate of the wicked, the righteous, and those of the intermediate class are recorded. The names of the righteous are immediately inscribed in the Book of Life and they are sealed \"to live\". The intermediate class is allowed a respite of ten days, until Yom Kippur, to reflect, repent, and become righteous;[23] the wicked are \"blotted out of the book of the living forever.\"[24]\nSome midrashic descriptions depict God as sitting upon a throne, while books containing the deeds of all humanity are opened for review, and each person passes in front of him for evaluation of his or her deeds.[25]\n\"The Holy One said, 'on Rosh Hashanah recite before Me [verses of] Sovereignty, Remembrance, and Shofar blasts (malchuyot, zichronot, shofarot): Sovereignty so that you should make Me your King; Remembrance so that your remembrance should rise up before Me. And through what? Through the Shofar.' (Rosh Hashanah 16a, 34b)\"[26]\nThis is reflected in the prayers composed by classical rabbinic sages for Rosh Hashanah found in traditional machzorim where the theme of the prayers is the \"coronation\" of God as King of the universe, in preparation for the acceptance of judgments that will follow on that day.\nThe best-known ritual of Rosh Hashanah is the blowing of the shofar, a musical instrument made from an animal horn. The shofar is blown at various points during the Rosh Hashanah prayers, and it is customary in most communities to have a total of 100 blasts on each day.[27] The shofar is not blown on Shabbat.[28]\nWhile the blowing of the shofar is a Biblical statute, it is also a symbolic \"wake-up call\", stirring Jews to mend their ways and repent. The shofar blasts call out: \"Sleepers, wake up from your slumber! Examine your ways and repent and remember your Creator.\"[29]\nAdditionally, the act of blowing the shofar, like the rainbow, is ordered by God as a reminder to God of humanity and our plight.[30]\nOn Rosh Hashanah day, religious poems called piyyutim, are added to the regular services. A special prayer book, the machzor (plural machzorim), is used on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.[31] A number of additions are made to the regular service, most notably an extended repetition of the Amidah prayer for both Shacharit and Mussaf. The shofar is blown during Mussaf at several intervals.[32] (In many synagogues, even little children come and hear the shofar being blown.)[further explanation needed] A variety of piyyutim, medieval penitential prayers, are recited regarding themes of repentance. The Aleinu prayer is recited during the silent prayer as well as the repetition of the Mussaf Amidah.[33]\nThe special Avinu Malkeinu prayer is also recited on Rosh Hashanah. In the Ashkenazic rite, Avinu Malkeinu is never recited on Shabbat (except in Ne'ila on Yom Kippur), and it is also omitted at Mincha on Fridays.\nThe narrative in the Book of Genesis describing the announcement of Isaac's birth and his subsequent birth[34] is part of the Torah readings in synagogues on the first day of Rosh Hashanah, and the narrative of the sacrifice and binding of Isaac[35] is read in synagogue on the second day of Rosh Hashanah.\nThe MussafAmidah prayer on Rosh Hashanah is unique in that apart from the first and last three blessings, it contains three central blessings making a total of nine. These blessings are entitled \"Malchuyot\" (Kingship, and also includes the blessing for the holiness of the day as in a normal Mussaf), \"Zichronot\" (Remembrance), and \"Shofarot\" (concerning the shofar). Each section contains an introductory paragraph followed by selections of verses about the \"topic\". The verses are three from the Torah, three from the Ketuvim, three from the Nevi'im, and one more from the Torah. During the repetition of the Amidah, the shofar is sounded (except on Shabbat) after the blessing that ends each section.[36] Recitation of these three blessings is first recorded in the Mishna,[37] though writings by Philo and possibly even Psalms 81[38] suggest that the blessings may have been recited on Rosh Hashanah even centuries earlier.[39]\nIn many Eastern Ashkenazi congregations, a kittel is worn during daytime Rosh Hashanah prayers, just as one is worn on Yom Kippur.\nRosh Hashanah is preceded by the month of Elul, during which Jews are supposed to begin a self-examination and repentance, a process that culminates in the ten days of the Yamim Nora'im, the Days of Awe, beginning with Rosh Hashanah and ending with the holiday of Yom Kippur.[40][41]\nThe shofar is traditionally blown on weekday mornings, and in some communities also in the afternoon, for the entire month of Elul, the month preceding Rosh Hashanah. The sound of the shofar is intended to awaken the listeners from their \"slumbers\" and alert them to the coming judgment.[42][40]\nThe shofar is not blown on Shabbat.[28]\nIn the period leading up to Rosh Hashanah, penitential prayers called selichot, are recited. The Sephardic tradition is to start at the beginning of Elul, while the Ashkenazic and Italian practice is to start a few days before Rosh Hashanah.[40]\nThe day before Rosh Hashanah day is known as Erev Rosh Hashanah (\"Rosh Hashanah eve\").[43] It is the 29th day of the Hebrew month of Elul, ending at sundown, when Rosh Hashanah commences. Some communities perform Hatarat nedarim (a nullification of vows) after the morning prayer services.[44] Many Orthodox men immerse in a mikveh in honor of the coming day.[45]\nRosh Hashanah meals usually include apples dipped in honey to symbolize a sweet new year;[46] this is a late medieval Ashkenazi addition. Other foods with a symbolic meaning may be served, depending on local minhag (\"custom\"), such as the head of a fish (to symbolize the prayer \"let us be the head and not the tail\").[47]\nMany communities hold a \"Rosh Hashanah seder\" during which blessings are recited over a variety of symbolic dishes.[48][49] The blessings have the incipit \"Yehi ratzon\", meaning \"May it be Thy will.\" In many cases, the name of the food in Hebrew or Aramaic represents a play on words (a pun). The Yehi Ratzon platter may include apples (dipped in honey, baked or cooked as a compote called mansanada); dates; pomegranates; black-eyed peas; pumpkin-filled pastries called rodanchas; leek fritters called keftedes de prasa; beets; and a whole fish with the head intact. It is also common among Sephardim to eat stuffed vegetables called legumbres yaprakes.[50]\nSome of the symbolic foods eaten are dates, black-eyed peas, leeks, spinach, and gourd, all of which are mentioned in the Talmud:[51] \"Let a man be accustomed to eat on New Year's Day gourds (\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0), and fenugreek (\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0),[52] leeks (\u05db\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9), beet [leaves] (\u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05e7\u05d0), and dates (\u05ea\u05de\u05e8\u05d9).\"\nCarrots can have multiple symbolic meanings at the Rosh Hashanah table. The Yiddish word for carrot is ma\u2019rin (\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05df), which also means \u201cincrease.\u201d By eating carrots one asks for their merits and blessings to be increased. Sliced carrots are also typically eaten to symbolize gold coins and hopes for continued wealth and prosperity. In Hebrew the word for carrot is gezer (\u05d2\u05d6\u05e8) which sounds similar to the word g\u2019zar - the Hebrew word for \u201cdecree.\u201d Serving carrots on Rosh Hashanah symbolizes a desire to have God nullify any negative decrees against us.[53]\nPomegranates are used in many traditions, to symbolize being fruitful like the pomegranate with its many seeds.[54] Typically, round challah bread is served, to symbolize the cycle of the year.[54][46] From ancient to quite modern age, lamb head or fish head were served. Nowadays, lekach (honey cake) and gefilte fish are commonly served by Ashkenazic Jews on this holiday. On the second night, new fruits are served to warrant the inclusion of the shehecheyanu blessing.[47]\nThe general Ashkenazic custom is to eat sweet foods, such as honey cake and teiglach, to auger a sweet year. The Sephardic and Mizrahi custom is frequently to eat light-coloured foods, or rather, to avoid dark ones, so as to avoid a dark year.[citation needed]\nThe ritual of tashlikh is performed on the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah by most Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews (but not by Spanish and Portuguese Jews or some Yemenites, as well as those who follow the practices of the Vilna Gaon). Prayers are recited near natural flowing water, and one's sins are symbolically cast into the water. Many also have the custom to throw bread or pebbles into the water, to symbolize the \"casting off\" of sins. In some communities, if the first day of Rosh Hashanah occurs on Shabbat, tashlikh is postponed until the second day. The traditional service for tashlikh is recited individually and includes the prayer \"Who is like unto you, O God... And You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea\", and Biblical passages including Isaiah 11:9 (\"They will not injure nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be as full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea\") and Psalms118:5\u20139, Psalms 121 and Psalms 130, as well as personal prayers. Though once considered a solemn individual tradition, it has become an increasingly social ceremony practiced in groups. Tashlikh can be performed any time until Hoshana Rabba, and some Hasidic communities perform Tashlikh on the day before Yom Kippur.[55]\nThe Hebrew common greeting on Rosh Hashanah is Shanah Tovah (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4; pronounced[\u02c8\u0283ona\u02c8t\u0254\u0361\u026ava] in many Ashkenazic communities and pronounced[\u0283a\u02c8nato\u02c8va] in Israeli and Sephardic communities), which translated from Hebrew means \"[have a] good year\".[56] Often Shanah Tovah Umetukah (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d5\u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05e7\u05d4\u200e), meaning \"[have a] Good and Sweet Year\", is used.[57] In Yiddish the greeting is \u05d0\u05b7 \u05d2\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d9\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8 \"a gut yor\" (\"a good year\") or \u05d0\u05b7 \u05d2\u05d5\u05d8 \u05d2\u05e2\u05d1\u05e2\u05e0\u05d8\u05e9\u05d8 \u05d9\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8 \"a gut gebentsht yor\" (\"a good blessed year\").[56] The formal Sephardic greeting is Tizku Leshanim Rabbot (\"may you merit many years\"),[58] to which the answer is Ne'imot VeTovot (\"pleasant and good ones\"); while in Ladino, they say \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05d0\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4, \u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05e1\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9 \"anyada buena, dulse i alegre\" (\"may you have a good, sweet and happy New Year\").[citation needed]\nA more formal greeting commonly used among religiously observant Jews is Ketivah VaChatimah Tovah (Hebrew: \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4\u200e), which translates as \"A good inscription and sealing [in the Book of Life]\",[56] or L'shanah tovah tikatevu v'techatemu meaning \"May you be inscribed and sealed for a good year\".[57] After Rosh Hashanah ends, the greeting is changed to G'mar chatimah tovah (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05de\u05e8 \u05d7\u05ea\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4\u200e) meaning \"A good final sealing\", until Yom Kippur.[56] After Yom Kippur is over, until Hoshana Rabbah, as Sukkot ends, the greeting is Gmar Tov (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05b0\u05bc\u05de\u05b8\u05e8 \u05d8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u200e), \"a good conclusion\".[59]\nUnlike the denominations of Rabbinical Judaism, Karaite Judaism believes the Jewish New Year starts with the first month and celebrates this holiday only as it is mentioned in the Torah, that is as a day of rejoicing and shouting.[60] Karaites allow no work on the day except what is needed to prepare food (Leviticus 23:23, 24).[61]\nThe Torah defines Rosh Hashanah as a one-day celebration, and since days in the Hebrew calendar begin at sundown, the beginning of Rosh Hashanah is at sundown at the end of 29 Elul. Since the time of the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE and the time of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, normative Jewish law appears to be that Rosh Hashanah is to be celebrated for two days, because of the difficulty of determining the date of the new moon.[8] Nonetheless, there is some evidence that Rosh Hashanah was celebrated on a single day in Israel as late as the thirteenth century CE.[63]\nOrthodox and Conservative Judaism now generally observe Rosh Hashanah for the first two days of Tishrei, even in Israel where all other Jewish holidays dated from the new moon last only one day. The two days of Rosh Hashanah are said to constitute \"Yoma Arichtah\" (Aramaic: \"one long day\"). In Reform Judaism, while most congregations in North America observe only the first day of Rosh Hashanah, some follow the traditional two-day observance as a sign of solidarity with other Jews worldwide.[64]Karaite Jews, who do not recognize Rabbinic Jewish oral law and rely on their own understanding of the Torah, observe only one day on the first of Tishrei, since the second day is not mentioned in the Written Torah.[65]\nOriginally, the date of Rosh Hashanah was determined based on observation of the new moon (\"molad\"), and thus could fall on any day of the week. However, around the third century CE, the Hebrew calendar was fixed, such that the first day of Rosh Hashanah never falls out on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday.[66][67]\nRosh Hashanah occurs 163 days after the first day of Passover, and thus is usually (but not always) determined by the new moon closest to the autumnal equinox.\nIn terms of the Gregorian calendar, the earliest date on which Rosh Hashanah can fall is 5 September, as happened in 1842, 1861, 1899, and 2013. The latest Gregorian date that Rosh Hashanah can occur is 5 October, as happened in 1815, 1929, and 1967, and will happen again in 2043. After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Rosh Hashanah falling no earlier than 6 September. Starting in 2214, the new latest date will be 6 October.[68]\nIn 2020 the Jewish President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced that Ukraine would declare Rosh Hashanah a national holiday.[69] This makes Ukraine the only country besides Israel where the day is a national holiday.[citation needed]\n^Exodus 12:2[9] refers to the month of Aviv (later renamed Nisan) as \"the first month of the year\", and in Ezekiel 45:18,[10] \"the first month\" unambiguously refers to Nisan, the month of Passover, as made plain by Ezekiel 45:21.[11]\n^Mulder, Otto (2003).

In the United Kingdom, for example, Tuesday, the 24th of March, 1750, was immediately followed by Wednesday, the 25th of March, 1751. See the Julian Calendar#New Year's Day for details.\n^Rashi (Keritot 6a) calls rubia by its Hebrew name \"tiltan\" (Heb. \u05ea\u05dc\u05ea\u05df), which word he explains elsewhere as being fenugreek. However, Rabbi Hai Gaon, in one of his responsum in \"Otzar Ha-Geonim\", seems to suggest that \"rubia\" (Heb. \u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0) means cowpeas, or what others call, \"black-eyed peas\" (\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9). Rabbi Hai Gaon's disciple, Rabbi Nissim ben Jacob (in his Commentary known as Ketav Hamafteah), thus explains the word \u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0, in our case spelled \u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0, as meaning non-other than cowpeas (\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9), describing them as having a \"dark eye in its center\". Jews of North-Africa traditionally make use of stringed beans in place of rubia.\n^A popular mnemonic is \"lo adu rosh\" (\"Rosh [Hashanah] is not on adu\"), where adu has the numerical value 1-4-6 (corresponding to the numbering of days in the Jewish week, in which Saturday night and Sunday daytime make up the first day).",

        "context": "\nThe contest consists of two days of computer programming/coding and problem-solving of algorithmic nature. To deal with problems involving very large amounts of data, it is necessary to have not only programmers, \"but also creative coders, who can dream up what it is that the programmers need to tell the computer to do. The hard part isn't the programming, but the mathematics underneath it.\"[1]\nStudents in each country are selected for their country's team through national computing contests. Students at the IOI compete on an individual basis. There is no official team ranking.\nThe IOI is one of the most prestigious computer science competitions in the world. UNESCO and IFIP are patrons.\nOn each of the two competition days, the students are typically given three problems which they have to solve in five hours. Each student works on his/her own, with only a computer and no other help allowed, specifically no communication with other contestants, books etc. Usually to solve a task the contestant has to write a computer program (only in C++) and submit it before the five-hour competition time ends. The program is graded by being run with secret test data. From IOI 2010, tasks are divided into subtasks with graduated difficulty, and points are awarded only when all tests for a particular subtask yield correct results, within specific time and memory limits. In some cases, the contestant's program has to interact with a secret computer library, which allows problems where the input is not fixed, but depends on the program's actions \u2013 for example in game problems. Another type of problem has known inputs which are publicly available already during the five hours of the contest. For these, the contestants have to submit an output file instead of a program, and it is up to them whether they obtain the output files by writing a program (possibly exploiting special characteristics of the input), or by hand, or by a combination of these means. Pascal has been removed as an available programming language as of 2019.[2]:11\nIOI 2010 for the first time had a live web scoreboard with real-time provisional results. Submissions will be scored as soon as possible during the contest, and the results posted. Contestants will be aware of their scores, but not others', and may resubmit to improve their scores. Starting from 2012, IOI has been using the Contest Management System (CMS) for developing and monitoring the contest.\nThe scores from the two competition days and all problems are summed up separately for each contestant. At the awarding ceremony, contestants are awarded medals depending on their relative total score. The top 50% of the contestants are awarded medals, such that the relative number of gold : silver : bronze : no medal is approximately 1:2:3:6 (thus 1/12 of the contestants get a gold medal).\nPrior to IOI 2010, students who did not receive medals did not have their scores published, making it impossible for a country to be ranked by adding together scores of its competitors unless each wins a medal. From IOI 2010, although the scores of students who did not receive medals are still not available in the official results, they are known from the live web scoreboard. In IOI 2012 the top 3 nations ranked by aggregate score (Russia, China and USA) were subsequently awarded during the closing ceremony.\nAnalysis of female performance shows 77.9% of women obtain no medal, while 49.2% of men obtain no medal. \"The average female participation was 4.4% in 1989\u20131994 and 2.2% in 1996\u20132014.\" It also suggests much higher participation of women on the national level, claiming sometimes double-digit percentages in total participation on the first stage.[3] President of the IOI, Richard Forster, says the competition has difficulty attracting women and that in spite of trying to solve it, \"none of us have hit on quite what the problem is, let alone the solution.\"[1]\nIn IOI 2017 held in Iran, due to not being able to participate in Iran, the Israeli students participated in an offsite competition organized by IOI in Russia.[2]:11 Due to visa issues, the full USA team was unable to attend, although one contestant Zhezheng Luo[4] was able to attend by traveling with the Chinese team[5] and winning gold medal and 3rd place in standings.[6]\nIn IOI 2019 held in Azerbaijan, the Armenia team did not participate due to the dispute between the two countries, despite the guarantees provided[7] and official invitation letter sent by the host Azerbaijan.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, both the IOI 2020 and IOI 2021, originally scheduled to be hosted by Singapore, were held as online contests. The IOI 2022, hosted by Indonesia, was held as a hybrid event, with around 25% of the contestants participating online.[8]\nThe following is a list of the top performers in the history of the IOI.[64] The P sign indicates a perfect score, a rare achievement in IOI history. The U sign indicates an unofficial participation, where a contestant participated in a host's second team. Also, first (I), second (II) and third (III) places among gold medalists are indicated where appropriate.

        "context": "\nAmerica's Got Talent (often abbreviated as AGT) is a televised American talent show competition, and is part of the global Got Talent franchise created by Simon Cowell. The program is produced by Fremantle USA (as well as distributed by) and Syco Entertainment, and broadcasts on the NBCtelevision network. It premiered on June 21, 2006, after plans for a British edition in 2005 were suspended, following a dispute within the British broadcaster ITV. Production would later resume in 2007,[3] following the success of the first season. Each season is mainly run during the network's summer schedule, and has featured various hosts over the course of the program's history. The current host is Terry Crews.\nThe program attracts a variety of participants from across the United States and abroad, who possess some form of talents. Acts range from singing, dancing, comedy, magic, stunts, variety and other genres. Each participant or act who auditions, attempts to secure a place in the live episodes of a season, by impressing a panel of judges. The current line-up consists of Cowell,[4]Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, and Sof\u00eda Vergara. Participants making it into the live episodes, compete against each other for both the judges' and public's vote, in order to reach the live final. The winner receives a large cash prize (primarily paid over a period of time), and since the third season, a chance to headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip.\nThe show itself has been a rating success for NBC, drawing in on average around 10 million viewers per season. In 2013, a book titled Inside AGT: The Untold Stories of America's Got Talent was released, providing a description of the seasons, contestants, judges and production techniques of the show. It includes detailed interviews with contestants from all seasons, up to the date of the book's publication.[5]\nThe series has run for a total of eighteen seasons, with the eighteenth season airing May\u2013September 2023, and has spawned four spin-off competitions: America's Got Talent: The Champions, which premiered in January 2019, AGT: Extreme, which premiered in February 2022, America's Got Talent: All-Stars, which premiered in January 2023, and AGT: Fantasy League, which will premiere in 2024. The main series is set to return for season nineteen in summer 2024 with host Crews and judges Cowell, Mandel, Klum, and Vergara all expected to return.\nSimon Cowell, creator of America's Got Talent and the Got Talent franchise, is primarily a judge on the British international version of the franchise. He has operated as a judge on AGT since May 2016.\nThe concept of America's Got Talent was devised by The X Factor creator and Sony Music executive Simon Cowell, who sought to create a talent competition far grander than those of other televised talent contests. His proposal, first made to British television network ITV in 2005, was for a competition in which participants of any age and location could enter with any form of talent they chose to perform. The network favored the concept, and green-lit production of a pilot episode to test out the format, with Cowell forming a panel consisting of himself and two other judges (including tabloid journalist Piers Morgan).[6] The pilot proved to be a success. The original plan for the program was for a British edition to be produced and broadcast between 2005 and 2006, hosted by British television personality Paul O'Grady, who had assisted with the pilot[7] (before Cowell would propose the format for American television). However, O'Grady became involved in a dispute with ITV during work on the new program, ultimately terminating his contract with them and defecting to another British network.[8]\nAs a result, Cowell suspended work on the British edition, and hastened his efforts on launching the format in America. Approaching several networks, Cowell received an offer from NBC to produce his televised competition for their network, owing to feedback given to the pilot made for ITV, and agreed to a contract to produce fifteen episodes for the 2006 summer schedule. Cowell worked with Fremantle and his company Syco Entertainment, but decided against becoming a judge for the new program, choosing to act as executive producer instead. Regis Philbin served as the host,[9] with David Hasselhoff, Brandy Norwood and Morgan as judges.[10] The first season proved a success, leading NBC to commission additional seasons, and prompting ITV to contact Cowell with the intention of resuming production on the British edition for 2007. The success of Britain's Got Talent (along with the American series), led Cowell to accept offers for the rights to the competition format, creating the Got Talent franchise.\nEach year's competition begins with a set of audition stages, the first being the \"Producers' Auditions\", is conducted across various cities in the United States.[11] This stage is open to all forms of acts and judged by an independent group, and thus determines who will take part in the next stage of auditions titled \"Judges' Auditions\". These are held in a public venue, within select cities across the country, and are attended by the judges handling that year's contest.\nEach participant reaching this stage of auditions is held offstage from the main performing area in a waiting room, and given a number that denotes when they will perform. Upon being called before the judges, the participant is given 90 seconds to demonstrate their act, with a live audience present for all performances. Each judge is given a buzzer, and may use it during a performance if they are unimpressed, dislike what is being performed, or feel the act is a waste of their time. If a participant is buzzed by all judges, their performance is automatically over. At the end of a performance, the judges give constructive criticism and feedback about what they saw, whereupon they are each given a vote. A participant requires a majority vote approving their performance to proceed to the next stage, otherwise they are eliminated from the program at that stage. Many acts that move on may be cut or forfeit their place, due to the limited slots available for the next stage. Filming for each season begins when the Judges' Auditions are taking place, with the show's presenter standing in the wings of each venue's stage to interview, and give personal commentary on a participant's performance.\nFrom the fifth to seventh seasons, acts who did not attend live auditions could instead submit a taped audition online via YouTube. Acts from the online auditions were then selected to compete in front of the judges and a live audience during the \"live shows\" part of the season, prior to the semi-finals. Before the inclusion of this round, the show had a separate audition episode in Seasons 3 and 4 (2008\u20132009) for contestants who posted videos on MySpace.[12]\nIn the ninth season, the show added a new format to the auditions in the form of the \"Golden Buzzer\", which began to make appearances within the Got Talent franchise, since it was first introduced on Germany's Got Talent. During auditions, each judge is allowed to use the Golden Buzzer to send an act automatically into the live shows, regardless of the opinion of the other judges. When it was initially used, the buzzer simply saved an act from elimination. The only rule to the buzzer was that a judge could use it only once per season. The host was later allowed to use the Golden Buzzer for an act starting from the eleventh season.\nAfter auditions are completed, the judges conduct a special session (or second \"audition\" round) to determine which participants will secure a place in the live rounds of the competition, though the format for this stage has been change several times over the course of the program's history. When the stage was first created after the first season, it was designed around a \"boot camp\" format titled \"Las Vegas Callbacks\". Under the format's rules, participants who made it through the preliminary auditions could undergo training to perfect their act, whereupon each would be assigned to a specific group of participants and perform a second time before the judges. Buzzers would be used to terminate a performance at any time, with those not deemed worthy of a place being eliminated from that season's format.\nBetween the fourth and ninth season, the format was changed to match that used in Britain's Got Talent. Participants who made it through the preliminary auditions had their audition footage reviewed by the judges, who set each one into a specific group, and were not required to perform again (unless the judges requested this). Acts which they liked would be allocated spaces in the live rounds, with the remainder eliminated from that season's competition. All acts were brought back to learn of the results of the judges' deliberations. The format was titled \"Vegas Verdicts\" and held on the Las Vegas Strip. For the final seasons of its usage, it was re-dubbed \"Judgment Week\" and conducted within New York.[13]\nBetween the tenth season and fourteenth season, the stage's format was changed again under a new arrangement dubbed \"Judge Cuts\". Under the new format's rules, participants that passed the preliminary auditions underwent a second stage of auditions before the judges at a fixed venue. However, their performance would not only be judged by the panel, but also by a special guest judge, with all participants divided up into four groups. Each group would be judged by their own guest judge. Like the auditions, the main judges could use their buzzers at any time to stop a performance, while the guest judge would be allowed to use a Golden Buzzer for a participant they particularly liked (as well as providing comments on the performances they watched). In the fifteenth season, the round was condensed into a single episode and featured no guest judge, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in 2020. The round was replaced to its current arrangement for the sixteenth season, matching that of Britain's Got Talent around that time.\nParticipants who pass their auditions and secure a place in the live rounds of the competitions, including those who received the Golden Buzzer after the format's introduction and subsequent amendment to match other Got Talent editions, are divided into groups and compete against each other to secure a place within the live final of the competition. Live episodes of the competition are held within a set venue (the location has varied), with the current arrangement focused on a venue within Los Angeles and live episodes for each season being aired weekly on the network. The arrangement differs from the schedule used by other international editions. Britain's Got Talent, for example, broadcasts its live episodes within the space of a single week. The structure of the live rounds by this stage of the competition has varied, but is more commonly arranged as quarter-finals, semi-finals and the final itself. Earlier seasons varied, sometimes having the finals split into separate rounds.\nThe format of the live rounds, for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, sees each participant conduct a new performance of their act before the judges and the viewers within a \"performance\" episode. In this episode, the judges can still give out feedback and comments about a participant's performance, and be able to use their buzzers, with the performance terminated if all the buzzers are used. After the episode is broadcast, the network provides the public a set period of time to vote for their act, with the results of these held in a separate \"results\" episode. When it is broadcast has varied, though it more commonly occurs after an interval of one day after the live \"performance\" episode. Participants wore the same outfits from the performance episode and are then informed of the results, with those receiving the highest votes (i.e. Top 4) advancing to the next stage. For the two acts that receive the mid-range of votes for all participants, they undergo a vote by the judges to determine who joins those who advanced. When the program brought in the format of using four judges, a tie-break on this vote results in the act with the higher number of public votes moving on. The Judges' vote was not a common format element in earlier seasons. In the first season, the judges did not decide on who moved on, instead voting for acts they liked or disliked. In the second season, they could not vote on acts at all, instead only being able to buzz them.\nFor some acts that are eliminated, there is still a chance for advancement by being appointed as that round's \"Wildcard\". Until the tenth season, this format varied in how it would work. In some seasons, the judges could each individually select an act, or more than one, to move on to the next stage or compete within a special Wildcard round. In other seasons, the Wildcard acts were selected from among the auditions and competed in a special round. Since the tenth season, the format is more structured and works in a similar manner to that of the format used by Britain's Got Talent, in that the judges and the public can each chose the acts they want to see move on as a Wildcard act. Although the judges are refrained from choosing a quarter-finalist as a Wildcard act, the public may vote online for an act within each quarter-final and semi-final to move on into the next stage, with this vote aptly named after the sponsor for the show in that respective season.\nThose who make it into the season's final compete against each other to secure the most votes from the public, with the number of finalists varying between seasons. Later seasons allow each finalist more than one performance and sometimes being joined by a celebrity guest, previous winner, or notable participant from a previous season. The winning act that achieves the most votes is crowned the winner and receives a cash prize. Although stipulated as $1 million per the program's advertising, in reality winners can choose to either take it as a lump sum, or as a financial annuity of this amount that is paid out over forty years at around $25,000 per year. Both options are liable to taxation.[14] Since Season 10, the winner will also perform on the first results show of the next season. From 2008, the program also includes an additional prize of headlining a show, except from between 2010 and 2013, where the winning finalist headlined a national tour.[15][16] The show they headline mainly takes place within Las Vegas.[17]\nTerry Crews became the host in 2019, following his involvement in AGT: The Champions in January 2019.\nHowie Mandel is the longest serving judge on America's Got Talent, since joining in June 2010.\nNick Cannon is the longest-serving host of the series, hosting eight seasons between 2009 and 2016.\n^ Cowell was absent from the live shows of season 15 due to an accident that resulted in a back injury. After doctors required him to remain under medical observation, production brought in temporary stand-ins for the first two quarter finals, before settling on airing the remaining live rounds with a judging panel of three.\n^Eric Stonestreet had to stand in for Klum during part of season 15, after she fell ill during the last two audition sessions.\nIn its first season, the judging panel consisted of David Hasselhoff, Brandy Norwood and Piers Morgan, with Regis Philbin as the host. Prior to the start of the second season, Norwood stepped down due to a legal matter she was involved with,[19][20] leading to her being replaced by Sharon Osbourne.[21] Philbin was replaced by Jerry Springer as the show's host.[22] Further changes were made to the judging panel and hosting duties in later seasons: Springer left after the third season, and was replaced by Nick Cannon for the fourth season.[23] Hasselhoff left the show after the fourth season, and was replaced by Howie Mandel for the fifth season.[24] Morgan left after the sixth season, and was replaced by Howard Stern for the seventh season.\nIn August 2012, Osbourne left the program following a dispute with NBC.[25][26] While the network replaced her with former Spice Girls member Mel B in February 2013,[27] the judges panel increased to four. This format change had already occurred in other international versions of the competition, such as on Britain's Got Talent two years prior. In March 2013, supermodel Heidi Klum was announced as the fourth judge for the eighth season.[28] In October 2015, Stern was replaced by Simon Cowell for the eleventh season.[4] After his eighth year hosting America's Got Talent, Cannon announced plans to retire from the show due to comments he made about the network.[29] Despite being under contract to continue his hosting duties, NBC eventually replaced him with Tyra Banks for the twelfth season.\nOn February 11, 2019, NBC announced a change to the program's host and its judging panel following the conclusion of the thirteenth season. Banks decided to move on to other projects, leading to her being replaced by Terry Crews, who was already working with the network as host of America's Got Talent: The Champions. Both Klum and Mel B decided to leave America's Got Talent due to other commitments that year, leading to actress Gabrielle Union and dancer Julianne Hough replacing them, joining Mandel and Cowell on the judging panel.[30] However, both Union and Hough took part in only one season before they were let go by the program on November 22, 2019.[31] On February 27, 2020, it was confirmed that Klum would return for the next season, and announced Sof\u00eda Vergara as the fourth judge.[32] In September 2021, host Crews announced the 'end of an era' following the season sixteen finale of America's Got Talent and the series finale of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, stating that these both marked the end of his deal with NBC.[33] However, Crews continued his hosting duties in the following seasons.\nIn 2015, guest judges were introduced into the program as part of the revamp of the format's boot camp stage. The following lists the guest judges who appeared within the program for the \"Judge Cuts\", per season and in order of their appearance by week:\nThe first season for America's Got Talent was promoted in May 2006, and was eventually aired later that year between June 21 and August 17. While later episodes would pre-record auditions at earlier dates, this season had them conducted across June, at venues within the cities of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Live-round episodes were held within the latter city. Initial advertisements for participants of America's Got Talent implied that the winning act would headline a show in Las Vegas, but this was later dropped in favor of a cash prize of $1 million, due to concerns surrounding the possibility of awarding such a prize to a minor.\nThe first season was hosted by Regis Philbin, with the judging panel consisting of actor David Hasselhoff, singer Brandy Norwood and journalist Piers Morgan. More than 12 million viewers watched the program's premiere episode, a far greater viewing figure than had been achieved by the premiere of American Idol in 2002, becoming one of the most-watched program on U.S. television and the highest-rated among viewers aged 18 to 49 at that time.[34] The first season was won by singer Bianca Ryan, with clogging group All That and musical group The Millers being the runners-up. Neither act were defined in the results in terms of who was placed 2nd, and who was placed in 3rd.\nFollowing the success of the previous season, NBC commissioned the program for additional episodes, but originally intended for the new season to be aired as part of its 2007 winter schedule. However, the network decided against this due to the program potentially being placed in direct competition for viewers with American Idol, and kept America's Got Talent within its 2007 summer schedule.[35] The second season aired between June 5 and August 21, 2007. Prior to filming taking place, Philbin left the program and was replaced as host by Jerry Springer.[36] Norwood dropped out, due to a legal situation, and was replaced by Sharon Osbourne. Auditions for this season involved venues within the same cities as had been previously used, but with the inclusion of Dallas as part of its competition schedule.\nThe second season saw the introduction of a new round in the audition process, which was referred to as the \"boot camp stage\", a period of callback episodes filmed in Las Vegas, aimed at streamlining successful participants from the first round of auditions towards a set number for the live rounds. Alongside this, participants in the live rounds moved on via the public vote only, while the episode for results was aired a week after each live episode's performance and within a smaller time slot for its broadcast. This season was won by singing impressionist and ventriloquistTerry Fator, with singer and guitarist Cas Haley coming in second, and singer Butterscotch placing third.\nThe third season aired between June 17 and October 1, 2008, with a break in its broadcast between August 7 and 26 to avoid conflict with NBC's live broadcasts of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Auditions took place much earlier in the production schedule to provide time for finalizing editing on recorded footage, taking place between January and April across venues within the same cities from the previous season, but with the addition of a venue within the city of Atlanta. Unlike the previous season, the Las Vegas callback episodes doubled the number of semi-finalists involved in the live rounds.\nFollowing the second season, judges voted between the participants placed 5th and 6th in the public vote during the quarterfinals and semi-finals, to determine who moved on at each stage. Apart from some amendments to the program's format, staff also implemented cosmetic changes to the set pieces used on America's Got Talent. An example of this included the \"red X's\", used to symbolize disapproval from each judge, being redesigned to match the visual style of those used in Britain's Got Talent. This season was won by opera singer Neal E. Boyd, with singer and pianist Eli Mattson coming in second, and violinists Nuttin' But Stringz placing third.\nThe fourth season aired between June 23 and September 19, 2009, and was the first season to be broadcast in high definition. Auditions were held between January and April, at venues within New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. Additional auditions were held within Washington, D.C., Miami, Tacoma, Boston and Houston. Along with conducting live auditions, participants could also audition by uploading a video of their performance directly to the program's website. Prior to filming taking place, Springer departed from the program following the previous season, and was replaced by Nick Cannon as host.[37]\nFor the fourth year of the competition, the prize for winning was amended so that the winner not only received a cash prize, but would be given their own 0-week headline show at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Apart from the change in the prize, the Results episodes after each performance episode were returned to their original broadcast format. This season was won by country music singer Kevin Skinner, with opera singer B\u00e1rbara Padilla coming in second,[38] and percussionists Recycled Percussion placing third.\nThe fifth season was originally intended to be aired as part of NBC's 2009 Fall schedule, much as had been intended with the second season.[39] However, the network disliked the idea and made certain the program was part of its 2010 summer schedule, with this season airing between June 1 and September 15, 2010.[40] Audition were held between January and April, at venues within Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, Portland (Oregon), Atlanta and Philadelphia. Prior to filming taking place, Hasselhoff left the show due to other commitments,[41] and his role as judge was taken over by comedian Howie Mandel.[42]\nOnline auditions for the program were modified to allow registration via YouTube, with a guaranteed placement in the competition. The live rounds were extended to include two new quarter-finals, each themed to certain groups of participants: those who were chosen from their YouTube auditions and those who had been eliminated during the second round of auditions or their quarter-finals. The final stage of the competition included its finalists conducting performances, each with their own guest performer, a format that would become a part of the program and an optional choice for finalists in future seasons. The finalists were offered a place on the America's Got Talent Live Tour that year, regardless of their final result, although the winner would be made the headline act for the tour in addition to their main prize.[15][16] This season was won by singer/musician Michael Grimm, with classical singer Jackie Evancho coming in second, and performance group Fighting Gravity placing third.\nThe sixth season aired between May 31 and September 14, 2011, with no major changes to the format for this year. Auditions were held between January and April within Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, Houston, Minneapolis, Seattle, Denver and Chicago. Online auditions made via YouTube were conducted on May 4. This season was won by singer Landau Eugene Murphy, Jr., with dance group Silhouettes coming in second, and dance group Team iLuminate placing third.\nThe seventh season aired between May 14 and September 13, 2012, with auditions held between October 2011 and February 2012. These were conducted within the cities of New York, Washington, D.C., Tampa, Charlotte, Austin, Anaheim, St. Louis and San Francisco.[43] Prior to filming taking place, Morgan departed from America's Got Talent after the conclusion of the sixth season (despite signing a three-year contract with the program in July 2010),[44] due to other commitments he had at that time.[45]\nDue to Morgan's departure, his role as judge was taken over by radio personality Howard Stern. However, because of his involvement with hosting his radio show for SiriusXM, the program's production of live episodes were moved to a venue in New York to avoid disrupting his schedule.[46] The graphical presentation of America's Got Talent was revamped, including the title credits, logo and theme music. The change of venue to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, New Jersey not only allowed Cowell to have designers update the studio set, but allowed production staff to invite larger audiences for performances in live episodes than in previous seasons.[47] This season was won by dog tricks act Olate Dogs, with comedian Tom Cotter coming in second, and musician William Close placing third.\nThe eighth season aired between June 4 and September 18, 2013,[48] with auditions held between January and March in a much larger range of venues. Auditions held in the cities of New York, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Antonio were filmed for the new season. Prior to filming commencing, Osbourne left AGT following the seventh season, after a lengthy dispute in August 2012 between herself and NBC.[49][50] While her departure not only led to her role as judge being taken over by Spice Girls member Mel B,[51] the judge panel for future seasons was increased, recruiting supermodel Heidi Klum to join the new season as a fourth judge.[52]\nFor the live episodes of this season, the venue moved from Newark to New York, holding them within Radio City Music Hall. In addition, the format for audition episodes in terms of presentation style, was changed to match that for Britain's Got Talent. In this arrangement, each episode would consist of a number of auditions chosen from those taken from each major venue used for that season.[53] This season was won by martial arts dancer/mime Kenichi Ebina, becoming the first foreign act to win America's Got Talent, with stand-up comedian Taylor Williamson coming in second, and singer/guitarist Jimmy Rose placed third.\nThe ninth season aired between May 27 and September 17, 2014.[54] Preliminary auditions were held between October and December 2013, across several cities including Miami, Atlanta, Houston and Baltimore. The Judge auditions were held between February and April 2014 within Newark, New York and Los Angeles.[55] For this season only, a third-party program was involved in the audition process: one quarter-final place in the competition was offered exclusively by The Today Show via their website, with the top three picked from those that entered competing against each other to be part of America's Got Talent that year.\nSeveral changes were made to the program for this season. The most significant was the introduction of the \"Golden Buzzer\" format, first introduced on Germany's Got Talent in 2012, which had also been introduced into Britain's Got Talent earlier that year. However, it was used mainly to save an act from elimination in the auditions, and wouldn't match the format used across the Got Talent franchise until the following year.[56]\nOther changes included the \"boot camp\" round being filmed in New York, and the introduction of a new online vote for viewers, named after the program's sponsor during that season. This determined which three acts placed in the mid-range of the public vote: 5th, 6th and 7th in the semi-finals, with 4th, 5th and 6th in the \"Top 12\" round advancing, and the remaining two voted by the judges. This season was won by magician Mat Franco, with singer Emily West coming second, and acrobatic troupe AcroArmy placing third.\nThe tenth season aired during 2015, between May 26 and September 16. Producer auditions took place between late 2014 and early 2015 within Tampa, Nashville, Richmond, New York, Chicago, St. Louis, San Antonio, Albuquerque, San Francisco, Seattle, Boise, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.[57] Judge auditions took place during spring until early summer 2015, between March and June within Newark, New York and Los Angeles.[53][58] A special \"extreme\" audition session was held within Pomona, California (performed on an outdoor stage), for participants with acts considered too dangerous to be conducted within an indoor studio set.\nThis season had the Golden Buzzer format, introduced in the previous season, matching that of Britain's Got Talent. Its use would send a participant directly into the live rounds, although the host was not allowed to use it per the revised format.[59] In addition, the boot camp round was revamped with a new format and renamed as \"Judge Cuts\", in which they were held over four weeks rather than one. It consisted of about eighty acts shortlisted from the auditions with around twenty per week, and featured the involvement of a guest judge for each of these episodes. Along with the main judges, they could use the Golden Buzzer for an act they wished to see in the live rounds. Neil Patrick Harris, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Marlon Wayans and Piers Morgan became the first guest judges for the new format in this season.[60][61] The \"Snapple Vote\", introduced in the previous season, was renamed the \"Dunkin' Save\" to coincide with the program's new sponsor. Its format expanded to cover quarter-finalists who finished in 6th, 7th or 8th place per public vote, along with the semi-finalists who finished in 4th, 5th or 6th place per public votes.\nThe eleventh season aired during 2016, between May 31 and September 16.[62] Open auditions were held between late 2015 and early 2016, within Detroit, New York, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, San Jose, San Diego, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Orlando and Dallas.[63] Filming of the judges' auditions took place in March 2016, prior to the premiere episode of the season, and were exclusively conducted within the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles.[64] The season premiered on May 31, 2016.[62] During the previous season on June 24, 2015, Howard Stern announced his departure from America's Got Talent on his TV program,[65] leading to Simon Cowell announcing on October 22 that he would later be replacing him for season eleven.[4] On October 4, 2016, Cowell signed a contract that would keep him as a judge on America's Got Talent until 2019.[66] Stern's departure led to live-round broadcasts moving back to Los Angeles,[67] and filmed at the Dolby Theatre.[68] Apart from this change, the Golden Buzzer format allowed the host (Nick Cannon) to use it during auditions.[69]\nThe twelfth season aired during 2017, between May 30 and September 20.[71] Open auditions were held in late 2016 to early 2017, within Chicago, Austin, Cleveland, Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Diego, New York, Charleston, Memphis and Los Angeles.[72] Filming of the Judges' audition were conducted in March 2017 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles. On February 13, 2017, Nick Cannon resigned from hosting America's Got Talent, following a dispute between himself and NBC concerning remarks he had made during his Showtime comedy special Stand Up, Don't Shoot.[73] As a result, despite Cannon being under contract, the network replaced him with supermodel Tyra Banks.[74]\nThis season is notable for the death of American physician Brandon Rogers (who died in an automobile accident on June 11, 2017), shortly after securing his place on America's Got Talent during the audition's stage. Rogers became involved in the program, following his involvement with American R&B vocal group Boyz II Men earlier that year, after the group had seen footage of him singing on YouTube. In the wake of his death, his audition was postponed before eventually airing during the final audition episode of the season on July 11, as a tribute to his memory.[75]\nThe thirteenth season aired during 2018, between May 29 and September 19.[79][80] Open auditions were held in late 2017 until early 2018, within Orlando, Cincinnati, Savannah, Milwaukee, Houston, Las Vegas, New York, Nashville and Los Angeles.[81] The Judges' auditions were filmed in March 2018 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles.[82] A minor change was made to the format of the Judge Cuts in terms of the number of participants in this stage from the auditions being reduced to seventy-two, with about eighteen performing each week. The guest judges featured in the Judge Cuts for the thirteenth season consisted of Ken Jeong, Olivia Munn, Martina McBride and Chris Hardwick. This season was won by magician Shin Lim, with acrobatic group Zurcaroh coming in second, and violinist Brian King Joseph placing third.\nThe fourteenth season aired during 2019, between May 28 and September 18. Following the previous season, Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum and Mel B, all opted to leave the program. Banks announced her resignation in December 2018,[83] while Klum and Mel B announced their respective departures two months later.[84] Due to this, replacements were sought in February 2019. Terry Crews was appointed as Banks' successor, following his role on the program's spin-off The Champions, while both Julianne Hough and Gabrielle Union were appointed as new judges for the upcoming season.[84] Both auditions and filming began on March 3, 2019.[85][86] On November 22, 2019, it was announced that Hough and Union were let go from the series, marking their only season as judges.[87]\nAlong with the guest judges for the fourteenth season's Judge Cuts were Brad Paisley, Dwyane Wade, Ellie Kemper and Jay Leno.[88] This season is notable for two additional guest judges being added for the live semi-finals: Sean Hayes and Queen Latifah.[89] This season was won by singer and pianist Kodi Lee, with choir group Detroit Youth Choir coming in second, and stand-up comedian Ryan Niemiller placing third.\nThe fifteenth season aired during 2020, between May 26 and September 23. Following the previous season, replacements were made for Union and Hough, after both were let go from the program in November 2019.[31] This resulted in the return of Heidi Klum, along with Sof\u00eda Vergara as a new judge.[32] Although filming had begun by late February with auditions, the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States towards March caused production delays. Live audiences were discontinued, per the advice against large gatherings by health experts. Production was eventually suspended after Klum fell ill during filming, raising concerns about the risk of infection.[90] While production on the live rounds went under discussion, the program confirmed the season would premiere in May with audition episodes, after footage for these was completed and edited for broadcast.[91]\nProduction for the remainder of the season resumed in mid-June, while the season was being broadcast. Several changes were made to minimize the potential for infection among those involved, including participants and judges. While the Judges Cuts round was drastically changed, effectively condensing the stage into a single episode,[92][93] the live rounds featured several measures. These included being filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood, the use of a virtual audience, and an expansion in the number of quarter-finalists.[94][95][96]\nPrior to the first quarter-final, Cowell was seriously injured in an accident and absent from the remainder of the season. Guest judges appeared for two of the quarter-finals, before opting to maintain the use of three judges for the remainder of the episodes.[97] The season was won by spoken word poet Brandon Leake, with country duo Broken Roots coming in second, and singer Cristina Rae placing third.\nA sixteenth season was announced in late February 2021 by NBC, confirming both the host and its judges, including the return of Cowell.[98] Production began after auditions were opened up with participants asked to provide these for judgment, either virtually or via recorded video.[99][100] On March 9, 2021, it was announced that the season would premiere on June 1.[101] This season was won by magician Dustin Tavella, with aerialist Aidan Bryant coming in second, and stand-up comedian Josh Blue placing third.\nThe seventeenth season was announced on March 31, 2022, with the same judging panel and host from the previous two seasons set to return. The season premiered on May 31, 2022.[102][103] This season was won by dance group Mayyas, with pole dancer Kristy Sellars coming in second, and singer and guitarist Drake Milligan placing third.\nThe cast for the eighteenth season was revealed on March 3, 2023, with the same judging panel and host from the previous three seasons announced to be returning.[104] The season premiered on May 30, 2023.[105] This season was won by dog tricks act Adrian Stoica and Hurricane, with magician Anna DeGuzman coming in second, and dance group Murmuration placing third.\nDuring the season eighteen finale on September 27, 2023, it was revealed that the series was officially renewed for a nineteenth season. The season will air in summer 2024 with the full cast from the previous seasons all expected to return.[18]\nIn 2015, America's Got Talent Live discontinued operating as a live tour, instead functioning as a series of shows at the Planet Hollywood Resort in Las Vegas. Performances from the top acts from the tenth season included winner Paul Zerdin, runner-up Drew Lynch, and fan favorite Piff the Magic Dragon. In 2016, four more shows were scheduled at the same venue, and featured performances from the top acts of the eleventh season's final: Grace VanderWaal, The Clairvoyants and Tape Face.[109] In 2017, another four shows were scheduled at the same venue, and featured performances by the top acts of the twelfth season's final: Darci Lynne, Angelica Hale, Light Balance and Preacher Lawson.[110] In 2018, three new shows were scheduled at a new venue in Las Vegas, and featured the top acts from the thirteenth season: Shin Lim, Samuel J. Comroe, Courtney Hadwin, Vicki Barbolak and Duo Transcend.\nIn 2018, NBC commissioned a second special centered on Darci Lynne, the winner of the twelfth season. Titled Darci Lynne: My Hometown Christmas, it was hosted by Farmer, and involved Lonnie Chavis from This Is Us as the special's announcer. It broadcast at the Alex Theatre on December 11, 2018. The special featured a special sketch involving Farmer and that season's judges: Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum and Mel B. A series of duets included Farmer with Lindsey Stirling, Toby Keith and Kristin Chenoweth, respectively. Guest performances were by Pentatonix and Hunter Hayes.\nIn May 2018, NBC commissioned executive producer and Got Talent creator Simon Cowell with producing an all-starspin-off competition, titled America's Got Talent: The Champions. Cowell had conceived of an idea for a global competition consisting of participants that had appeared across the Got Talent franchise across the years, including notable acts and winners. The format for the spin-off would be similar to the main program, though episodes would be pre-recorded when the spin-off contest was held in autumn, and then later broadcast during the network's winter schedule.[114][115][116]\nThe spin-off premiered in January 2019, and as of February 2020, has aired two seasons. AGT season 13 winner Shin Lim,[117] and AGT season 14 finalists V.Unbeatable, won their respective season's contest.\nOn May 14, 2021, NBC announced its second spin-off of the main AGT show, with a focus on daredevil acts. Got Talent creator Cowell serves as an executive producer and judge for the series.[118] Originally planned for a mid-season summer 2021 debut,[119] filming for the series occurred at the Atlanta Motor Speedway between September 27 and October 20, 2021,[120][121] and wrapped in early January 2022.[122]\nOn October 7, 2022, NBC announced its third spin-off of the main AGT show. Similar to America's Got Talent: The Champions, America's Got Talent: All-Stars features winners, finalists, fan favorites, and others from previous seasons of AGT across the Got Talent franchise, competing for the All-Star title. The series, with judges Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, and Howie Mandel as well as host Terry Crews, began production in October 2022,[125] and premiered on January 2, 2023.[126]\nOn September 21, 2023, the fourth spin-off for the AGT series was announced. AGT: Fantasy League will feature the judges competing in a fantasy sports draft-like competition, mentoring the acts to attempt to get an act from their own team be crowned champion. Mel B, who last appeared in the franchise in the first season of America's Got Talent: The Champions in 2019, will return to judge alongside other returning judges Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, and Howie Mandel, with Terry Crews returning to host as well.[127]\nSince the show began, its ratings have been very high, ranging from 9 million viewers to as many as 16 million viewers (generally averaging around 12 million viewers). The show has also ranked high in the 18\u201349 demographic, usually rating anywhere from as low as 1.6 to as high as 4.6 throughout its run. Audition shows and performance shows rate higher on average than results shows.\nAlthough the show's ratings have been high, the network typically keeps the show's run limited to before the official start of the next television season in the third week of September, with some reductions or expansions depending on Olympic years. Finale ratings are usually lower due to returning programming on other networks.\nThe highest rated season in overall viewers to date is season four (2009). The most-watched episode has been the finale of season five (2010), with 16.41 million viewers. The series premiere and an episode featuring the first part of Las Vegas Week in season six (2011) have each tied for highest rating among adults 18\u201349, both having a 4.6 rating.",

        "context": "\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season is the current hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere. It officially began on June 1, and will end on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic.[1] However, the formation of subtropical or tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the formation of a subtropical storm on January 16, the earliest start of an Atlantic hurricane season since Hurricane Alex in 2016.[2] This system went unnamed operationally, as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) treated it as non-tropical. Despite the presence of an intensifying El Ni\u00f1o, which typically results in less Atlantic hurricane activity, the season has been very active in terms of the number of named storms, due in large part to persistent, very warm sea surface temperatures.[3]\n* June\u2013November only \u2020 Most recent of several such occurrences. (See all)\nIn advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and research groups. More than 25 forecasts were made for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.[29] Among them were forecasts from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Prediction Center, Mexico's Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (SMN), Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), the United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMO), and Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray and their associates at Colorado State University (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. According to NOAA and CSU, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1991 and 2020 contained roughly 14 tropical storms, seven hurricanes, three major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 74\u2013126 units.[30] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h). NOAA typically categorizes a season as above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is sometimes also considered.[5]\nOn December 6, 2022, TSR released the first early prediction for the 2023 Atlantic season, predicting a slightly below average year with 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.[7] Their updated prediction on April 6, 2023, called for a similar number of hurricanes, but reduced the number of named storms and major hurricanes by one.[8] The following day, the University of Arizona (UA) posted their forecast calling for a very active season featuring 19 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 163 units.[9] On April 13, CSU researchers released their prediction calling for 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 100 units.[31] Also on April 13, TWC posted their forecast for 2023, calling for a near average season with 15 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.[11] On April 27, University of Missouri (MU) issued their predictions of 10 named storms, 4 between categories one and two, and 3 major hurricanes.[13] On May 1, University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) released their forecast for 12 to 20 named storms.[14] On May 4, SMN issued its forecast for the Atlantic basin, anticipating 10 to 16 named storms overall, with 3 to 7 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes.[15] On May 25, NOAA announced its forecast, calling for 12 to 17 named storms, 5 to 9 hurricanes, and 1 to 4 major hurricanes, with a 40% chance of a near-normal season and 30% each for an above-average season and a below-average season.[16] One day later, UKMO issued its forecast calling for an extremely active season, with 20 named storms, 11 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 222 units.[17]\nIn general, there was a wide range of conclusions among the groups making pre-season forecasts. With regard to number of hurricanes, projections ranged from 5 by SMN to 11 by UKMO. This reflected an uncertainty on the part of the various organizations about how the expected late-summer El Ni\u00f1o event and near record-warm sea surface temperatures would together impact tropical activity.[29]\nOn June 1, the first official day of the season, CSU issued an updated forecast in which they raised their numbers slightly, now expecting a near-average season with 15 named storms, 7 hurricanes, 3 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 125 units. They observed sea surface temperatures in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic had increased further to almost record-highs, which could offset increased wind shear from the impending El Ni\u00f1o.[19] On June 16, UA updated its seasonal prediction, which indicates a very active hurricane season, with 25 named storms, 12 hurricanes, 6 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 260 units.[20] On July 6, CSU issued an updated forecast increasing their numbers, predicting a very active season; they now expect 18 storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes, with an ACE index of 160 units.[22] The following day, TSR released the first seasonal prediction, predicting a slightly above average year with 17 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes and an ACE index of 125.[23] On July 19, TWC updated their forecast, calling for a very active season with 20 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes, citing that a very warm Atlantic ocean could exert more influence and override the El Ni\u00f1o influence.[24]\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and will end on November 30. Nonetheless, it unexpectedly commenced on January 16, when an unnamed subtropical storm formed off the northeastern U.S. coast then moved over Atlantic Canada.[32] Operationally, the NHC considered the storm to be non-tropical, with minimal likelihood of transitioning into a subtropical or tropical cyclone.[33] A post-storm evaluation of the system to determine its proper classification was conducted by a team of forecasters from the NHC and Ocean Prediction Center (OPC). As a result, it was re-designated as subtropical prior to the official start of the season.[32] Tropical Storm Arlene began as a tropical depression on June 1, in the Gulf of Mexico, and became the season's first named storm on June 2. Later that month, when Tropical Storm Bret and Tropical Storm Cindy formed, there were two Atlantic tropical cyclones active simultaneously in June for the first time since 1968.[34] The two developed in the Main Development Region (MDR) from successive tropical waves coming off the coast of West Africa.[35] Their formation also marked the first time on record that two tropical storms have formed in the MDR during the month of June.[36] Next, Subtropical Storm Don formed over the central Atlantic on July 14. A long-lived storm, it later became fully tropical and strengthened into the season's first hurricane as it meandered around the ocean far from land.[37][38]\nThree simultaneous tropical cyclones in the west-central Atlantic on August 29: Idalia (left), Franklin (center), and Tropical Depression Eleven, which would become Jose (far right). The remnants of Gert, which later regenerated, are also visible between Franklin and Eleven.\nFollowing a lull in activity, tropical cyclogenesis picked up drastically in late August. Within a span of 39 hours during August 20\u201322, four tropical storms formed: Emily, Franklin, Gert, and Harold.[39][40] This marked the fastest time four storms were named within the Atlantic basin, surpassing the previous mark of 48 hours, set in 1893 and matched in 1980.[41] Emily formed in the eastern Atlantic, lasting only 24 hours before dissipating. Franklin moved across the Dominican Republic, before intensifying into a Category 4 hurricane in the western Atlantic.[42] Gert became a remnant low on August 22, but regenerated into a tropical cyclone ten days later, on September 1.[43] Tropical Storm Harold affected south Texas and brought much needed rainfall to the region. Those four were followed by two more systems during last week of the month: Idalia, and Jose. Idalia formed on August 26 in the Northwestern Caribbean, intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, then made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida at Category 3 strength. Tropical Storm Jose formed in the open Atlantic on August 31.[44]\nThe quick pace of storm formation continued into September, the climatological peak of the hurricane season. On September 1, Tropical Storm Katia formed northwest of Cabo Verde in the far eastern Atlantic.[43] After Gert and Katia dissipated, Tropical Storm Lee formed in the central tropical Atlantic on September 5.[45] It became a hurricane a day later, and then rapidly intensified to Category 5 strength, with its winds increasing by 85 mph (135 km/h) during the 24\u2011hour period ending at 06:00 UTC on September 8. This made Lee the third\u2011fastest intensifying Atlantic hurricane on record, behind only Felix and Wilma.[46] Lee later made multiple landfalls in Atlantic Canada as an extratropical cyclone. Tropical Storm Margot formed next, and strengthened into the season's fifth hurricane on September 11.[47] They were joined by Tropical Depression Fifteen, later Hurricane Nigel, which formed midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cabo Verde Islands on September 15.[48] Nigel remained far from any land masses, and became extratropical on September 22. That same day, Tropical Storm Ophelia formed offshore of North Carolina.[49] The storm moved inland the following morning at near-hurricane strength.[50] Also on September 23, Tropical Storm Philippe formed in the eastern tropical Atlantic.[51] Right behind Philippe came Tropical Storm Rina five days later. At that time, Philippe and Rina were approximately 620 mi (1,000 km) apart, which is close enough to influence each other's movement and development.[52]\nAfter a brief letup in activity, Tropical Storm Sean formed on October 11, in the eastern tropical Atlantic.[53] Later, on October 18, Hurricane Tammy formed.[54] It made landfall on Barbuda, the second system in three weeks to do so, in addition to Philippe.[55] A few days later, short-lived Tropical Depression Twenty-One formed offshore Nicaragua, moved inland, and soon dissipated.[56]\nThis season's ACE index as of November 14, 2023, as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the NHC, is approximately 145.6 units.[57] This number represents sum of the squares of the maximum sustained wind speed (knots) for all named storms while they are at least tropical storm intensity, divided by 10,000. Therefore, tropical depressions are not included.[5]\nOn January 16, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a special tropical weather outlook concerning a low-pressure area centered roughly 300 mi (480 km) north of Bermuda. The NHC noted that the low exhibited thunderstorm activity near its center but assessed it as unlikely to transition into a tropical or subtropical cyclone.[58] These thunderstorms may have developed due to the combination of the cyclone's position over the Gulf Stream, where sea surface temperatures around 68\u201370 \u00b0F (20\u201321 \u00b0C) and cold air aloft resulted in high atmospheric instability.[33] Contrary to expectations, a subtropical storm formed on January 16, about 345 mi (555 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Developing with sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), the system initially intensified, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) early on January 17. At 12:45 UTC, it made landfall at Louisbourg, Nova Scotia, as a weakening storm, then soon became a post-tropical low, before dissipating over far eastern Quebec the next day.[32]\nThere was no storm-related damage reported, likely because its most intense winds remained offshore.[2] The subtropical storm was located within a broader storm system that brought snowfall to parts of coastal New England, including up to 4.5 in (11 cm) in portions of Massachusetts, with 3.5 in (8.9 cm) of snow in Boston.[59] In Nova Scotia, the storm brought wind gusts of near 68 mph (110 km/h) to Sable Island.[32]\nOn May 30, the NHC began monitoring an area of disturbed weather over the eastern Gulf of Mexico for possible tropical development.[60] An area of low pressure developed the following day.[61] The system organized into Tropical Depression Two at 12:00 UTC on June 1, while located off the west coast of Florida.[62]Hurricane hunters investigated the depression on the morning of June 2, and determined that it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Arlene.[63] Moving southward, Arlene remained a minimal tropical storm throughout the day with sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). At 06:00 UTC on June 3, it weakened to a tropical depression. Six hours later, it degenerated into a remnant low, and then subsequently dissipated north of Cuba.[62] Arlene brought 2\u20136 in (51\u2013152 mm) of rainfall across South Florida, helping to reduce drought concerns along with other rains that week.[64]\nOn June 15, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave about to move off the coast of West Africa.[65] The disturbance became better organized due to warm sea surface temperatures and favorable atmospheric conditions.[66][67] On the morning of June 19, the disturbance organized into Tropical Depression Three about 1,495 mi (2,410 km) east of Barbados, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Bret that afternoon.[68] Gradual intensification occurred during the next couple of days as it headed west towards the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane hunters investigated Bret early on June 22 and found sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a central pressure of 996 mbar (29.4 inHg).[69] Soon after, Bret moved into an area of increased vertical wind shear, causing it to gradually weaken as it moved across the Lesser Antilles.[70] Overnight on June 22\u201323, it passed just north of Barbados and directly over St. Vincent.[71] Next, during the early hours of June 24, Bret passed just to the north of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao as a weakening storm with an exposed low-level center,[68] and soon opened into a trough near the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia.[72]\nOn June 18, the NHC began tracking a tropical wave that had recently moved off the coast of West Africa,[76] which became more organized the next day.[77] Though the system initially struggled to become better organized, it was in an environment overall conducive to development,[78][79] and organized into Tropical Depression Four on the morning of June 22, while about 1,395 mi (2,245 km) east of the Lesser Antilles.[80][81] Despite marginal atmospheric conditions, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Cindy early the next day. At 12:00 UTC on June 24, Cindy's sustained winds intensified to 60 mph (95 km/h). But later that day and continuing into the next, the storm grew progressively weaker. Then, at 06:00 UTC on June 26, Cindy dissipated about 375 mi (605 km) north-northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands.[80][82]\nA trough of low pressure formed over the central Atlantic on July 11, east-northeast of Bermuda.[83] Though the system remained embedded within the trough and had not developed a compact wind field, a well-defined center of circulation developed along with persistent deep convection early on July 14, prompting the NHC to classify it as Subtropical Storm Don early that morning.[84] Don's deep convection decreased later that day,[85] and it weakened to a subtropical depression early on July 16.[86] The next day, while beginning an anticyclonic loop over the central Atlantic, steered by a blocking ridge to its north, the system transitioned to a tropical depression.[87] Not long after, Don was upgraded to a tropical storm based on satellite wind data.[88] A few days later, while moving over the Gulf Stream on July 22, the storm quickly strengthened into the season's first hurricane.[89] Don remained a minimal Category 1 hurricane for several hours before weakening to a tropical storm early on July 23, when its structure quickly deteriorated as it moved over increasingly cooler waters north of the Gulf Stream.[90] Don continued to weaken due to cold waters and shear into the next day, transitioning to a post-tropical cyclone on July 24.[91]\nOn August 13, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a tropical wave coming off the coast of Africa, initially giving it a low chance of development through the next seven days.[92] The system struggled to organize amid conditions only marginally favorable, as it moved west-northwest over the open ocean. Eventually, it became sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate it Tropical Depression Six late on August 19.[93] The depression remained weak for a few days as it battled high vertical wind shear and otherwise unfavorable conditions before abruptly strengthening into Tropical Storm Gert at 04:00 UTC on August 22.[94] Soon however, increased wind shear from the outflow of nearby Tropical Storm Franklin caused Gert to weaken to a tropical depression that same afternoon. It subsequently lost its deep convection the following day, becoming a remnant low.[95][96] The low eventually opened up into a trough, but the remnants remained identifiable over the next week as the system trekked slowly northward into the central Atlantic.\nEarly on August 30, NHC began monitoring the remnants of Gert for potential redevelopment.[97] On September 1, the remnant low became well-defined, and the system regenerated into Tropical Depression Gert.[98] Gert continued its rebound, becoming a tropical storm once again later that day. Moving north-northeastward, its winds reached 60 mph (95 km/h) late on September 2, an intensification achieved in spite of strong northeasterly wind shear.[99] This intensity was maintained into the following day. Gert then began deteriorating while being drawn quickly northward and into the rotation around the larger remnant low of Post-Tropical Cyclone Idalia, and dissipated early on September 4, over the north Atlantic.[100]\nOn August 16, a tropical wave being monitored by the NHC emerged off the coast of Africa into the eastern tropical Atlantic.[101] Over the next few days, the system gradually organized under generally favorable conditions. On August 20, satellite wind data indicated that it was producing gale-force winds in its northern side, and the center became well-defined, prompting the NHC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Emily later that day.[102] Shortly after its formation, Emily was already beginning to be affected by high wind shear and a dry environment, leaving its center exposed. Eventually, Emily became devoid of deep convection and became a post-tropical cyclone on August 21.[103] However, the NHC continued to monitor the system for the chance of it redeveloping.[104] The system showed some signs of reorganization as it moved through the subtropical Atlantic on August 24,[105] but failed to organize further, and started to dissipate later that day.[106] The remnants were then absorbed by an elongated area of low pressure well east-northeast of Bermuda late on August 25.[107]\nOn August 17, the NHC first noted the possibility that a low pressure area could soon form at the back end of a trough of low pressure as it headed westward towards the Leeward Islands.[108] The low formed on August 19, near the Windward Islands.[109] It soon formed a well-defined center, after which the NHC designated the system as Tropical Storm Franklin on the afternoon of August 20.[110] While moving through the eastern Caribbean over the next couple of days, Franklin struggled to become better organized while battling strong westerly wind shear pushing most of its convection east of its center.[40][111] Early on August 23, the storm began moving northwestward before turning northward, becoming somewhat better organized and to intensify. Franklin then made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) south of Barahona, Dominican Republic, shortly before 12:00 UTC that day.[112][113]\nWeakening occurred after Franklin made landfall, and it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean at 21:00 UTC as a minimal tropical storm.[114] After struggling with strong westerly shear and land interaction for several days, Franklin entered a more favorable environment for development on August 25 and promptly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane the next morning.[115] A further decrease in wind shear along with less dry air allowed Franklin to begin to rapidly intensify, becoming the season's first major hurricane at 09:00 UTC on August 28.[116] Franklin then began to intensify even more rapidly, quickly becoming a Category 4 hurricane a few hours later,[117] and then reaching its peak maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). After that, Franklin underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, causing it to begin to slowly weaken. That trend continued after the cycle was completed as wind shear from the outflow of Hurricane Idalia increased over Franklin and by 09:00 UTC on August 30, it had weakened to Category 2 strength.[118] Later that day, Franklin turned east-northeastward and passed north of Bermuda. While doing so, the storm's eye structure began to deteriorate due to strong northerly wind shear.[119] Then, on September 1, Franklin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 790 mi (1,270 km) northeast of Bermuda, with Category 1-equivalent winds of 85 mph (140 km/h).[120] By September 4, ex\u2011Franklin was located north of the Azores. That afternoon, the NHC began to monitor the system once again, as it was expected to soon move southeastward towards warmer waters.[121] Some reorganization did take place,[122] but the system did not redevelop into a tropical cyclone. The NHC stopped monitoring the post-tropical cyclone on September 7.[123]\nFranklin brought heavy rainfall and wind, causing damage to buildings, homes, and light posts.[124] Two fatalities were reported in the Dominican Republic, with an additional person also missing.[124] At least 350 people were displaced, and more than 500 homes and 2,500 roads were affected or damaged.[125] Several communities in the Dominican Republic were cut off, and nearly 350,000 homes were left without power, and an additional 1.6 million homes were cut off from potable water.[125]\nOn August 15, the NHC began to monitor the Gulf of Mexico,[126] in anticipation that a tropical wave moving into the eastern Caribbean would enter the Gulf within a few days, and there interact with the remnants of an old cold front, initiating tropical cyclogenesis.[127] After passing to the south of the Bahamas and between Cuba and Florida,[128] the disturbance reached the Gulf of Mexico and began to become better organized on August 20\u201321, amid near record-warm sea surface temperatures of 86\u201390 \u00b0F (30\u201332 \u00b0C).[129] Due to the threat the developing system posed to the South Texas Gulf Coast, the NHC initiated advisories on it at 15:00 UTC. on August 21, designating it Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine.[130] The system developed into Tropical Depression Nine about six hours later.[131] Moving quickly westward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Harold at 06:00 UTC on August 22.[132] Harold strengthened some more before making landfall on Padre Island, in the Texas Coastal Bend region, at around 15:00 UTC that day with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h).[133][134] Six hours later, it weakened into a tropical depression.[135] Early on August 23, it degenerated to a remnant low as its circulation became increasingly ill-defined.[136]\nHarold generated modest storm surge as it approached landfall. The highest surge, 2.2 ft (0.67 m), occurred at San Luis Pass.[137] The storm brought 2\u20134 in (51\u2013102 mm) of rain to coastal southern Texas.[134]Corpus Christi received 5.25 in (133 mm) of rain from the system, including a daily record 4.74 in (120 mm) on August 22.[134] Tropical storm-force winds also spread across the region. Wind gusts reached up to 65 mph (105 km/h) at Corpus Christi and 67 mph (108 km/h) at Loyola Beach.[138] Over 35,000 customers across southern Texas lost power.[139] The London Independent School District was shut down for several days due to damage sustained during the storm.[140] Harold also brought heavy rain and strong wind to parts of northern Mexico, but caused only minor damage as it moved through.[141] In Piedras Negras, 4 inches (100 mm) of rain fell within a few hours.[142]\nOn August 24, a trough of low pressure formed in the Eastern Pacific basin offshore of the Central America coast.[143] The disturbance crossed over into the Atlantic basin and began to organize as it moved northward through the western Caribbean Sea. The pace of organization quickened on August 26, while the disturbance was located near the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and that afternoon was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ten.[144] Later that day, and into the next, the depression drifted due to weak surrounding steering currents, with its center moving in a small counter-clockwise loop.[145][146] The depression became Tropical Storm Idalia at 15:15 UTC on August 27, after a NOAA Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the storm's winds had increased to 40 mph (65 km/h).[147] Early the next morning, Idalia began moving northward[148] toward the Yucat\u00e1n Channel west of Cuba, intensifying along the way.[149] By early morning on August 29, after passing near the western tip of Cuba, the storm had developed sufficiently to be classified a Category 1 hurricane.[150] Then, benefiting from exceptional environmental conditions,[151] Idalia began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category 2 strength later that day.[152] Rapid intensification continued as the storm accelerated northward through the Gulf of Mexico and Idalia reached Category 4 strength on the morning of August 30, a few hours prior to landfall, reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg).[153] Idalia's strengthening was then halted by an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused it to weaken slightly before it made landfall at 11:45 UTC, about 20 miles (30 km) south of Perry, Florida, with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h).[154] Idalia quickly weakened as it moved inland into southeast Georgia,[155] and it was downgraded to a tropical storm at 21:00 UTC that same day.[156] Strong southwesterly wind shear then pushed the storm's convection well north and east of its center as it moved off the northeastern South Carolina coast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean early on August 31.[157] That afternoon, while southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, Idalia transitioned to a post-tropical cyclone.[158] The storm then moved slowly eastward and impacted Bermuda with tropical-storm-force winds on September 2, as it passed just to the south. Idalia's remnant low then absorbed Tropical Storm Gert,[100] turned northward, and lingered off the coast of Atlantic Canada for several days before dissipating on September 7.[159]\nOn August 26, 33 Florida counties were placed under a state of emergency (SOE) by Governor Ron DeSantis.[160] Two days later, the governor declared 13 more counties, including some in Northeast Florida, under a SOE.[161] On August 28, hurricane warnings and storm surge warnings were issued for portions of the state's west coast.[149] Idalia caused significant damage across the Big Bend region of Florida and southeastern Georgia. Thousands of structures were damaged or destroyed and four people died in storm-related incidents in the two states. Early estimates placed insured losses at $2.2\u20135 billion. The hurricane's remnants produced dangerous rip currents across the Eastern United States during Labor Day Weekend, resulting in at least five additional deaths and numerous rescues.[162]\nOn August 19, a vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa.[163] It traversed the Cabo Verde Islands, where an area of low-pressure formed late on August 23.[164] For several days, the disturbance was unable to become better organized.[165] The low at last become better defined on the morning of August 29, after persistent deep convection reignited over the eastern side of the circulation. That afternoon, it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven.[166] The depression meandered due weak steering currents over the next two days, and by August 30, had become less organized due to westerly shear.[167] However, the shear briefly relaxed, and the storm's convective bursting pattern abruptly evolved into curved banding early on August 31, signifying that the depression had strengthened into Tropical Storm Jose.[168] Further development was slow to come as Jose's banding features remained limited, and the convection at its center was shallow.[169] Even so, going into the early morning of September 1, the storm structure improved markedly as convection near the center deepened and a small mid-level eye feature appeared.[170][171] As a result, Jose's maximum sustained winds increased to 60 mph (95 km/h).[172] This intensification was short lived however, and the storm soon began to weaken due to northerly shear from Hurricane Franklin's outflow.[173] Jose then accelerated northward, pulled by the larger and stronger Franklin,[174] and was absorbed into the latter late that day.[175]\nOn August 28, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa.[176] A broad area of low pressure formed two days later near the Cabo Verde Islands.[177] On August 31, the disturbance began exhibiting signs that it was becoming better organized, and the low became better defined by the next morning.[178] As a result, it was designated Tropical Depression Twelve by the NHC at 15:00 UTC on September 1.[179] The following morning, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Katia.[180] On September 2, Katia's internal structure became better defined and its sustained winds reached 60 mph (95 km/h) that evening.[181] Overnight, however, increasing wind shear caused Katia to begin a weakening trend as its surface center became displaced far to the south of a remnant area of convection.[182] By 03:00 UTC on September 4, far northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression.[183] Then, late that day, it degenerated into a remnant low.[184]\nOn September 2, a tropical wave emerged into the tropical Atlantic from the west coast of Africa.[185] An area of low pressure formed from the wave two days later to the west-southwest of Cabo Verde.[186] On September 5, the low became more organized, with multiple low-level bands developing and formation of a well-defined center. Consequently, advisories were initiated on Tropical Depression Thirteen at 15:00 UTC that day.[187] Amid favorable conditions for intensification, the depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Lee six hours later.[188] Lee continued to intensify as it became better organized, with convective banding increasing and an eye beginning to form the following afternoon. By 21:00 UTC on September 6, the system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane[189] while located far to the east of the northern Leeward Islands.[190] Then, during the 24\u2011hour period ending at 06:00 UTC on September 8, Lee experienced explosive intensification, and reached Category 5 strength, with its winds increasing by 85 mph (135 km/h) to 165 mph (265 km/h).[46]\nSeveral hours later however, an increase of southwesterly wind shear, caused Lee's eye to become cloud filled and the storm became more asymmetric, causing it weaken back to a high-end Category 4 hurricane.[191] The pace of weakening quickened as the day progressed, and by early on September 9, Lee had become a low-end Category 3 hurricane.[192] Later that day, data from an evening hurricane hunters mission into the storm revealed that Lee was undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and still being adversely affected by modest vertical wind shear; observed peak flight level winds were down from an earlier mission. As a result of these findings, the hurricane was downgraded to Category 2 at 03:00 UTC on September 10.[193] Afterwards, as the eyewall replacement cycle was concluding, the wind shear abated, which permitted the new, larger-diameter eye to contract and to grow more symmetric; as a result, Lee intensified to Category 3 strength once again that same day.[194] The system underwent two more eyewall replacement cycles over the course of the next day and a half, and while they caused some fluctuations in its size and intensity, Lee remained a major hurricane throughout.[47][195]\nAfter tracking west-northwestward to northwestward for much of its trans\u2011Atlantic journey, Lee turned northward on September 13, moving around the western side of the steering subtropical ridge. That same day, it also weakened to Category 2 strength.[196][197] Then, on the morning of September 14, Lee became a Category 1 hurricane while approaching Bermuda,[198] which it passed to the west by 185 mi (300 km) later in the day.[199] As it pushed northward, continued drier air entrainment and increasingly strong southerly wind shear displaced Lee's convection to the northern side of the system, weakening it further. These factors caused the hurricane to commence its extratropical transition,[200] which was completed by 09:00 UTC on September 16.[201] Later that day, the center of the cyclone made landfall on Long Island, in Nova Scotia.[202] Through the overnight hours into September 17, Lee traversed New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland before moving into the Northern Atlantic.[203]\nSwells generated by Lee caused dangerous surf and rip currents along the entire Atlantic coast of the United States. Strong winds with hurricane\u2011force gusts caused extensive power outages in the U.S. state of Maine, and in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Three storm-related fatalities have been confirmed: a 15-year-old boy drowned in Fernandina Beach, Florida; a 50-year-old man died in Searsport, Maine, when a tree fell onto the car he was in; and a 21-year-old man who was killed in Manasquan Inlet, New Jersey when the boat he was in capsized and sunk due to a tall wave.[204][205]\nOn September 3, the NHC began to monitor a strong tropical wave moving westward across western Africa.[206] The wave moved into the western Atlantic Ocean two days later, and a broad area of low-pressure with a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms quickly formed within it shortly afterwards.[207] Shower and thunderstorm activity within the disturbance become better organized around an increasingly well-defined low-level center on September 7,[208] and Tropical Depression Fourteen formed about 160 mi (255 km) west of Cabo Verde.[209] Later the same day, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Margot.[210] Initially, northerly shear and dry mid-level air intruding from the southwest made it difficult for Margot to become better organized. These hindrances were offset by bursts of deep convection and a diffluent outflow pattern on September 9, allowing for some intensification to occur.[211] Margot continued to intensify gradually over the next couple of days while moving toward the north through the central Atlantic, and a ragged, but partially open eye emerged from the central dense overcast on the morning of September 11.[212] Later that day, Margot's eye became more defined and its overall structure improved, and the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.[213] It continued along a north to north-northwest track for a few days, exhibiting a double eyewall with a well-defined inner core, reaching maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on September 13.[214] It then became caught in weak steering currents by a building mid-level ridge to its north and drifted east-southeastward as it began to make a clockwise loop. Margot's slow motion upwelled cooler waters and that coupled with large amounts of dry air caused it to weaken to a tropical storm on September 15.[215] High wind shear and large amounts of dry air continued to negatively affect Margot and weakening continued as the storm's convection began to become increasingly displaced from the system's center.[216] It became bereft of organized deep convection on September 18, and transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone.[217]\nOn September 9, the NHC began monitoring an area of low pressure producing a concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms southwest of Cabo Verde, as well a tropical wave located inland near the coast of West Africa.[218] After it moved into the tropical Atlantic, a broad area of low pressure formed along the wave on September 11, southeast of the other disturbance.[219] The disturbances began to merge on September 12,[220] and by the next day, the dominant western low was showing some signs of organization.[221] Development continued, and the low became Tropical Depression Fifteen on September 15, far to the east of the Lesser Antilles.[222] Initially, the depression had a very broad structure and its deep convection fluctuated in intensity and organization for about a day without the low-level center becoming better defined.[223] Late on September 16, the depression finally started to become better organized with convective banding developing in its northern semicircle, and became Tropical Storm Nigel early the next morning.[224] Nigel slowly but steadily became better organized, and strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the morning of September 18, as an eyewall began to develop.[225] However, the strengthening trend was interrupted when dry air disrupted the storm's inner core.[226]\nLater, Nigel's eye become better defined and warmer once again, though convection on the north side was still being disrupted by intruding dry air.[227] Nonetheless, the system's 50\u201360 mi-wide (85\u201395 km) eye was soon fully surrounded by a solid band of deep convection, enabling Nigel to become a Category 2 hurricane late that afternoon.[228] It then turned northward, moving along the western edge of a mid-level ridge over the central subtropical Atlantic.[229] By the end of the day however, deep convection became limited to the southern portion of the band due to a break in the eyewall.[230] Unable to fill in the breach completely, Nigel weakened to Category 1 strength on September 20.[231] The hurricane's motion later shifted to the north-northeast, then toward the northeast on September 21, and accelerated, within the flow on the southeastern side of a strong mid-latitude trough. At the same time, increasing southwesterly wind shear began causing an elongation of Nigel's cloud pattern, resulting in further weakening.[232] Later, as the system raced northeastward at 37 mph (59 km/h), its environment became more hostile as the wind shear became very strong and sea surface temperatures fell to below 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C).[233] Consequently, Nigel's winds weakened to tropical storm strength and it transitioned to an extra-tropical cyclone on the morning of September 22, about 640 mi (1,030 km) north-northwest of the Azores.[234]\nOn September 17, the NHC first noted the potential for tropical cyclone development near the southeast coast of the United States in its seven-day outlook.[235] A few days later, a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms developed east of Florida within an offshore trough of low pressure.[236] A broad non-tropical area of low pressure formed within the area on September 21. Anticipating that the low could acquire some tropical or subtropical characteristics as it continued to form, coupled with its close proximity to the Southeastern United States, the NHC initiated advisories on it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen at 15:00 UTC that day.[237] The system's minimum barometric pressure fell appreciably on the morning of September 22, as it moved generally northward, still attached to a frontal feature. It was generating sustained tropical storm-force winds within its broad, asymmetric wind field, and the deep convection was concentrated to the north of the poorly formed, indistinct low level center of the circulation.[238] Later that day, it became detached from the frontal feature, and was designated Tropical Storm Ophelia.[49] The storm made landfall at 10:15 UTC, near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, about 25 mi (40 km) west-northwest of Cape Lookout, with winds of 70 mph (115 km/h).[239] Inland, Ophelia weakened as it moved northward through the state, and became a tropical depression that evening, after it crossed into southeast Virginia.[240] By 03:00 UTC on September 24, the system had lost its tropical characteristics, becoming a post-tropical cyclone.[241] The next day, its remnant circulation moved eastward off the New Jersey coast, as rains from the system swept northward into New England.[242] The remnants of Ophelia were absorbed by another offshore low-pressure area a few days later.[243]\nOn September 15, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave located inland over West Africa,[251] which moved offshore several days later.[252] On September 20, the wave began interacting with a disturbance just to its west, giving rise to a broad area of low\npressure the next day.[253] The disturbance developed a well-defined center on the morning of September 23, west of Cabo Verde, and deep convection associated with it became sufficiently organized to support formation of Tropical Depression Seventeen.[254] Later that day, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Philippe.[51] The storm strengthened some on the morning of September 24, as it moved westward through warm waters, steered along the southern side of a mid-level ridge.[255] Philippe struggled, however, to become better organized overall, due to persistent 25\u201330 mph (35\u201345 km/h) deep-layer west-southwesterly wind shear. As a result, its center became fully exposed and far removed to the west of the deep convection the following day.[256] Even so, there was a convective burst that formed near the center of circulation center late on September 26,[257] which continued into the following day. A convective band also began developing on the eastern side of the circulation.[258] Philippe's structure deteriorated somewhat on September 28, with satellite images showing an elongated circulation and multiple centers. As there was some deep convection on the east and southeast sides of what NHC determined was the main center, the system still met the requisite criteria of a tropical cyclone.[259] The storm also stalled, generally drifting to the southwest due to its interaction with Tropical Storm Rina to its east. Philippe remained adrift the following morning, and sheared, with the low-level center pushed to near the western edge of the main area of deep convection.[260] Philippe continued moving erratically for the next few days, strong northwesterly wind shear precluded any significant strengthening from occurring during this time.[261] On October 2, the storm turned toward the northwest, and made landfall on Barbuda that evening,[262] before passing near the U.S. Virgin Islands the next day.[263] Philippe turned northward on October 4, and weakened some due to wind shear, thunderstorm activity became limited to the southeastern quadrant of its circulation and winds of the western side fell to less than tropical storm-force.[264] The storm then transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone two days later as it approached Bermuda.[265][266]\nIn Guadeloupe, some areas were left without running water, and 2,500 power outages occurred.[267][268] Several homes and vehicles in Antigua and Barbuda were inundated by floodwaters.[268] Multiple schools were also damaged, and rainfall in Vieux-Fort, Guadeloupe, reached 380 mm (15 in).[269][270] Off the U.S. Virgin Islands, 12 people were rescued after a ship started to submerge in rough seas.[271][272] A cold front and Philippe's post-tropical remnants combined to bring up to 6 in (150 mm) to parts of Maine on October 7\u20138.[273] Gusts in the state were in the 50\u201360 mph (80\u201397 km/h) range.[274]\nOn September 23, NHC began to monitor a tropical wave just offshore of West Africa.[275] A broad area of low pressure formed the next day,[276] and the showers and thunderstorms within this disturbance began showing signs of organization a couple days later.[277] Moving west-northwest amid favorable conditions, a well-defined center formed within the disturbance early on September 28, at which time it was designated as Tropical Storm Rina.[278] The next day, Rina's wind field became slightly larger and stronger.[279] But it only intensified for a brief time before weakening once again[280] on account of strong northeasterly wind shear and dry mid-level air.[281] Rina became devoid of organized deep convection early on October 1, and its surface circulation became increasingly ill-defined during the day. Consequently, the system degenerated into a remnant low.[282]\nOn October 6, a potent low-latitude tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa.[283] The low became better organized on October 10, and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen late that day.[284] The next morning, the depression became Tropical Storm Sean about 725 mi (1,165 km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde.[285] Sean remained a highly sheared storm into the next day, with its center located well west of the associated deep convection.[286] Later, after weakening to depression strength overnight,[287] the system restrengthened back into a tropical storm on the morning of October 12.[288] Little additional organization occurred; by the morning of October 14, convective bursts became intermittent and fairly short lived, and the storm weakened once more to a tropical depression.[289] Thereafter, Sean degraded slowly, lingering for a day and a half before becoming a remnant low by very late on October 15.[290]\nOn October 11, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave located just offshore of west Africa.[291] Showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance became more concentrated and better organized on October 14,[292] but nearby dry air infiltrated the system, suppressing convection to some degree.[293] Later, when environmental conditions became more conducive, thunderstorm activity within the disturbance was able to become more organized on October 17.[294] The following afternoon, satellite imagery indicated a well-defined low-level surface circulation, prompting the NHC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Tammy.[54] Despite having a sheared appearance due to light to moderate westerly vertical wind shear, hurricane hunter data indicated that Tammy was strengthening as it moved quickly westward through record-warm waters towards the Leeward Islands on October 19.[295][296] The storm's inner core became better organized the following morning. Radar imagery showed that strong convection had quickly evolved into a curved band, and a closed eye. Meanwhile, aircraft data showed that its central pressure had fallen quickly, and sustained winds increased. As a result, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.[297] Later, Tammy passed to the east-southeast of Guadeloupe,[298] and then at 01:15 UTC on October 22, made landfall on Barbuda at its initial peak intensity of 85 mph (137 km/h).[299] It pulled away from the Leeward Islands throughout the day, though heavy rains still impacted the islands.[300] After weakening to a minimal hurricane while struggling against wind shear for a couple of days, Tammy began to strengthen on October 25 due to increasing upper-level divergence associated with a deep-layer trough.[301] Later that day, it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane and reached its peak intensity with sustained winds of 105 mph (169 km/h).[302] Shortly after peaking, Tammy then began to interact with a front to its north, which caused the hurricane to begin its transition to an extratropical cyclone. Tammy then merged with the front and transitioned into a strong extratropical cyclone early on October 26.[303] The next day, however, Tammy became detached from the front, and redeveloped into a tropical storm.[304] Not long afterward, environmental conditions began to deteriorate and strong vertical wind shear and dry air entrainment quickly stripped the storm of its convection and caused it to weaken. Tammy was then declared post-tropical again on October 29.[305]\nBarbuda received minimal damage while Antigua had only minor damage, though blackouts occurred across both islands. At least two families on Barbuda had to be evacuated.[55] Among the islands of Guadeloupe, only La D\u00e9sirade experienced hurricane force winds.[306] There were no reports of serious storm damage.[307] Rainfall amounts across the Leeward Islands were between 4 and 8 in (100 and 200 mm), and storm surge heights were between 1 and 3 ft (0.30 and 0.91 m).[308] Bermuda was impacted with wind gusts of 40 mph (65 km/h).[309]\nOn October 20, a broad area of low pressure developed over the far southwestern Caribbean Sea.[310] As the disturbance moved slowly towards the coast of Nicaragua on October 23, its surface circulation became more defined and heavy thunderstorm activity grew more intense and organized, resulting in the formation of Tropical Depression Twenty-One that afternoon.[311] It quickly made landfall in Nicaragua and dissipated the next day.[312] The remnants of the depression crossed over Central America and contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Pilar in the Eastern Pacific.[313]\nThe following list of names is being used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2023. This is the same list used in the 2017 season, with the exceptions of Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel, which replaced Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate, respectively;[314] each of the four new names was used for the first time this year. Names retired after the season, if any, will be announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2024. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2029 season.\nThis is a table of all of the storms that have formed in the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, intensities, areas affected, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2023 USD.",

        "context": "\nFull Moons have long captivated cultures worldwide due to their mystical allure, with various beliefs and customs stemming from these celestial events. Our Full Moon Calendar gives you the date, time, and traditional name of the next full Moon\u2014as well as future occurrences for this year and the next. Be sure to share your photos with your community here in the comments below! Also, check out our Full Moon Horoscopes.\nThe next full Moon, the Beaver Moon, will occur on Monday, November 27, and reach peak illumination at 4:16 AM Eastern Time. Interestingly, although it reaches a \u201cfull\u201d phase for a brief moment, our eyes may perceive it to be full for up to three days!\nA full Moon is the phase when the Moon appears to be fully illuminated from Earth\u2019s perspective.\nThis occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in alignment, forming a straight line. The Moon and The Sun are on exact opposite sides of the Earth. From this position, the Sun\u2019s light shines directly onto the portion of the Moon that is visible to us and creates a full, bright circle of light.\nThis phase comes about 15 days after the New Moon at the approximate midpoint of the lunar cycle (29.5 days). Technically, it is only considered \u201cfull\u201d on one specific day. Before and after that, it is either waxing or waning, respectively\u2014no matter how full it appears to be. If you want to get even more technical, it is only \u201cfull\u201d for a brief instant. These are the times listed in our calendars.\nFull Moon names have their roots in the traditions of North American Native American tribes. These tribes honored the changing seasons by assigning unique names to each one. Interestingly, these captivating names encapsulated the essence of a whole month in which they appeared.\nWhile there might have been some variations in the names from tribe to tribe, a strong sense of consistency resonated among the different regions. On this rich cultural backdrop, European settlers arrived and embraced the custom, weaving in some of their own versions into the tapestry of time.\nA Supermoon occurs when the Moon is at least 90% of the way to its perigee position at the same time it is in its \u201cfull\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d phase. An extreme perigean Supermoon is when a new or full Moon happens at the same time as perigee.\nCan you have two full Moons in a month? Yes, when that happens, the second one is referred to as a \u201cblue.\u201d (Though it is not blue in color!) On average, this happens every two to three years.\nAs mentioned above, even though the Moon may look full to you a few days before or after the exact time we list above, the Moon is only considered to be full for a brief instant. This peak illumination may occur during the day in some parts of the world. Learn more about this phenomenon.\nWhile there\u2019s no real consensus on how Moons affect our moods and physical well-being, there are plenty of studies and real-life experiences that blame it for everything from increased crime and injuries to lack of sleep. What do you believe? (Share your experience in the comments below.)\nPeople often find when they align their energies with the specific lunar phases, they feel more inspired and productive. Tuning into nature and the environment around us has been shown to help us understand ourselves on a deeper level. This is why many people engage in monthly routines for self-care to get in alignment with the cycles of nature in order to gain perspective and reconnect with themselves.\nThe phases of the Moon can and do influence fish activity. Similar to deer, fish are most active during the days leading up to and following a full or new Moon.

Higher tides may lure fish into new hunting areas, mainly if they coincide with the spawning of prey fish that can be easily traced.

        "context": "\nChinese New Year is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunisolarChinese calendar. In Chinese, the festival is commonly referred to as the Spring Festival (traditional Chinese: \u6625\u7bc0; simplified Chinese: \u6625\u8282; pinyin: Ch\u016bnji\u00e9)[2] as the spring season in the lunisolar calendar traditionally starts with lichun, the first of the twenty-four solar terms which the festival celebrates around the time of the Chinese New Year.[3] Marking the end of winter and the beginning of the spring season, observances traditionally take place from Chinese New Year's Eve, the evening preceding the first day of the year, to the Lantern Festival, held on the 15th day of the year. The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February.[note 1]\nChinese New Year is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, and has strongly influenced Lunar New Year celebrations of its 56 ethnic groups, such as the Losar of Tibet (Tibetan: \u0f63\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f66\u0f62\u0f0b), and of China's neighbours, including the Korean New Year (Korean: \uc124\ub0a0; RR: Seollal), and the T\u1ebft of Vietnam,[5] as well as in Okinawa.[6] It is also celebrated worldwide in regions and countries that house significant Overseas Chinese or Sinophone populations, especially in Southeast Asia. These include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar,[7] the Philippines,[8] Singapore,[9] Thailand, and Vietnam. It is also prominent beyond Asia, especially in Australia, Canada, Mauritius,[10] New Zealand, Peru,[11] South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as various European countries.[12][13][14]\nThe Chinese New Year is associated with several myths and customs. The festival was traditionally a time to honour deities as well as ancestors.[15] Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the New Year vary widely,[16] and the evening preceding the New Year's Day is frequently regarded as an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also a tradition for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill fortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Another custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red paper-cuts and couplets. Popular themes among these paper-cuts and couplets include good fortune or happiness, wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red envelopes.\nThe largest Chinese New Year parade outside Asia, in Chinatown, ManhattanTraditional paper cutting with the character \"Spring\" (\u6625)Chinese New Year decorations along New Bridge Road in SingaporeChinese New Year eve in Meizhou on 8 February 2005\nThe Chinese calendar defines the lunar month containing the winter solstice as the eleventh month, meaning that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an intercalary month intervenes).[17] In more than 96 per cent of the years, Chinese New Year's Day is the closest date to a new moon to lichun (Chinese: \u7acb\u6625; lit. 'establishment of spring') on 4 or 5 February, and the first new moon after dahan (Chinese: \u5927\u5bd2; lit. 'major cold'). In the Gregorian calendar, the Chinese New Year begins at the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February.[18]\nHand-written Chinese New Year's poetry pasted on the sides of doors leading to people's homes, Lijiang, Yunnan\nAccording to legend, Chinese New Year started with a mythical beast called the Nian (a beast that lives under the sea or in the mountains) during the annual Spring Festival. The Nian would eat villagers, especially children in the middle of the night.[19] One year, all the villagers decided to hide from the beast. An older man appeared before the villagers went into hiding and said that he would stay the night and would get revenge on the Nian. The old man put red papers up and set off firecrackers. The day after, the villagers came back to their town and saw that nothing had been destroyed. They assumed that the old man was a deity who came to save them. The villagers then understood that Yanhuang had discovered that the Nian was afraid of the color red and loud noises.[19] Then the tradition grew when New Year was approaching, and the villagers would wear red clothes, hang red lanterns, and red spring scrolls on windows and doors and used firecrackers and drums to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came to the village again. The Nian was eventually captured by Hongjun Laozu, an ancient Taoist monk.[20]\nBefore the new year celebration was established, ancient Chinese gathered and celebrated the end of harvest in autumn. However, this was not the Mid-Autumn Festival, during which Chinese gathered with family to worship the Moon. In the Classic of Poetry, a poem written during Western Zhou (1045 BC \u2013 771 BC) by an anonymous farmer, described the traditions of celebrating the 10th month of the ancient solar calendar, which was in autumn.[21] According to the poem, during this time people clean millet-stack sites, toast guests with mijiu (rice wine), kill lambs and cook their meat, go to their masters' home, toast the master, and cheer the prospect of living long together. The 10th-month celebration is believed to be one of the prototypes of Chinese New Year.[22]\nThe records of the first Chinese new year celebration can be traced to the Warring States period (475 BC \u2013 221 AD). In the L\u00fcshi Chunqiu, in Qin state an exorcism ritual to expel illness, called \"Big Nuo\" (\u5927\u513a), was recorded as being carried out on the last day of the year.[23][24] Later, Qin unified China, and the Qin dynasty was founded; and the ritual spread. It evolved into the practice of cleaning one's house thoroughly in the days preceding Chinese New Year.\nThe first mention of celebrating at the start of a new year was recorded during the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD). In the book Simin Yueling (\u56db\u6c11\u6708\u4ee4), written by the Eastern Han agronomist Cui Shi (\u5d14\u5bd4), a celebration was described: \"The starting day of the first month, is called Zheng Ri. I bring my wife and children, to worship ancestors and commemorate my father.\" Later he wrote: \"Children, wife, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren all serve pepper wine to their parents, make their toast, and wish their parents good health. It's a thriving view.\"[25] The practice of worshipping ancestors on New Year's Eve is maintained by Chinese people to this day.[26]\nHan Chinese also started the custom of visiting acquaintances' homes and wishing each other a happy new year. In Book of the Later Han, volume 27, a county officer was recorded as going to his prefect's house with a government secretary, toasting the prefect, and praising the prefect's merit.[27][28]\nDuring the Jin dynasty (266 \u2013 420 AD), people started the New Year's Eve tradition of all-night revelry called shousui (\u5b88\u6b72). It was described in Western Jin general Zhou Chu's article Fengtu Ji (\u98a8\u571f\u8a18 \u201cNotes on Local Conditions\u201d): \"At the ending of a year, people gift and wish each other, calling it Kuisui (\u994b\u6b72 \u201cgift time\u201d); people invited others with drinks and food, calling it Biesui (\u5225\u6b72 \u201cothers time\u201d); on New Year's Eve, people stayed up all night until sunrise, calling it Shousui (\u5b88\u6b72 \u201cguard the year\u201d).\"[29] The article used the word chu xi (\u9664\u5915) to indicate New Year's Eve, and the name is still used until this day.\nThe Northern and Southern dynasties book Jingchu Suishiji described the practice of firing bamboo in the early morning of New Year's Day,[30] which became a New Year tradition of the ancient Chinese. Poet and chancellor of the Tang dynasty Lai Gu also described this tradition in his poem Early Spring (\u65e9\u6625): \"\u65b0\u66c6\u624d\u5c06\u534a\u7eb8\u5f00\uff0c\u5c0f\u4ead\u7336\u805a\u7206\u7aff\u7070\", meaning \"Another new year just started as a half opening paper, and the family gathered around the dust of exploded bamboo pole\".[31] The practice was used by ancient Chinese people to scare away evil spirits, since firing bamboo would noisily crack or explode the hard plant.\nDuring the Tang dynasty, people established the custom of sending bai nian tie (\u62dc\u5e74\u5e16), which are New Year's greeting cards. It is said that the custom was started by Emperor Taizong of Tang. The emperor wrote \"\u666e\u5929\u540c\u6176\" (whole nation celebrate together) on gold leaves and sent them to his ministers. Word of the emperor's gesture spread, and later it became the custom of people in general, who used Xuan paper instead of gold leaves.[32] Another theory is that bai nian tie was derived from the Han dynasty's name tag, \"\u9580\u72c0\" (door opening). As imperial examinations became essential and reached their heyday under the Tang dynasty, candidates curried favour to become pupils of respected teachers, in order to get recommendation letters. After obtaining good examination marks, a pupil went to the teacher's home with a men zhuang (\u95e8\u72b6) to convey their gratitude. Therefore, eventually men zhuang became a symbol of good luck, and people started sending them to friends on New Year's Day, calling them by a new name, bai nian tie (\u62dc\u5e74\u5e16, New Year's Greetings).[33]\nThe Chunlian (Spring Couplets) was written by Meng Chang, an emperor of the Later Shu (935\u2013965 AD), during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period\uff1a\"\u65b0\u5e74\u7d0d\u9918\u6176\uff0c\u5609\u7bc0\u865f\u9577\u6625\" (Enjoying past legacies in the new year, the holiday foreseeing the long-lasting spring). As described by Song dynasty official Zhang Tangying in his book Shu Tao Wu, volume 2: on the day of New Year's Eve, the emperor ordered the scholar Xin Yinxun to write the couplets on peach wood and hang them on the emperor's bedroom door.[34][35] It is believed that placing the couplets on the door to the home in the days preceding the new year was widespread during the Song dynasty. The famous Northern Song politician, litterateur, philosopher, and poet Wang Anshi recorded the custom in his poem \"\u5143\u65e5\" (New Year's Day).[36]\n\u7206\u7af9\u8072\u4e2d\u4e00\u6b72\u9664\uff0c\n\u6625\u98a8\u9001\u6696\u5165\u5c60\u8607\u3002\n\u5343\u9580\u842c\u6236\u77b3\u77b3\u65e5\uff0c\n\u7e3d\u628a\u65b0\u6843\u63db\u820a\u7b26\u3002\nAmid the sound of firecrackers a year has come to an end,\nThe spring wind has wafted warm breath to the Tusu wine.\nWhile the rising sun shines over each and every household,\nPeople get rid of the old couplets and put up the new ones.\nThe poem Yuan Ri (\u5143\u65e5) also includes the word \"\u7206\u7af9\" (bao zhu, exploding bamboo), which is believed to be a reference to firecrackers, instead of the previous tradition of firing bamboo, both of which are called the same in the Chinese language. After gunpowder was invented in the Tang dynasty and widely used under the Song dynasty, people modified the tradition of firing bamboo by filling the bamboo pole with gunpowder, which made for louder explosions. Later under the Song, people discarded the bamboo and started to use paper to wrap the gunpowder in cylinders, in imitation of the bamboo. The firecracker was still called \"\u7206\u7af9\", thus equating the new and old traditions. It is also recorded that people linked the firecrackers with hemp rope and created the \"\u97ad\u70ae\" (bian pao, gunpowder whip) in the Song dynasty. Both \"\u7206\u7af9\" and \"\u97ad\u70ae\" are still used by present-day people to celebrate the Chinese New Year and other festive occasions.[37]\nIt was also during the Song dynasty that people started to give money to children in celebration of a new year. The money was called sui nian qian (\u968f\u5e74\u94b1), meaning \"the money based on age\". In the chapter \"Ending of a year\" (\u6b72\u9664) of Wulin jiushi (\u6b66\u6797\u820a\u4e8b), the writer recorded that concubines of the emperor prepared a hundred and twenty coins for princes and princesses, to wish them long lives.[38]\nThe new year celebration continued under the Yuan dynasty, when people also gave nian gao (\u5e74\u7cd5, year cakes) to relatives.[39]\nThe tradition of eating Chinese dumplings jiaozi (\u9903\u5b50) was established under the Ming dynasty at the latest. It is described in the book Youzhongzhi (\u914c\u4e2d\u5fd7): \"People get up at 5 in the morning of new year's day, burn incense and light firecrackers, throw door latch or wooden bars in the air three times, drink pepper and thuja wine, eat dumplings. Sometimes put one or two silver currency inside dumplings, and whoever gets the money will attain a year of fortune.\"[40] Modern Chinese people also put other food that is auspicious into dumplings: such as dates, which prophesy a flourishing new year; candy, which predicts sweet days; and nian gao, which foretells a rich life.\nIn the Qing dynasty, the name ya sui qian (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322, New Year's Money) was given to the lucky money given to children at the new year. The book Qing Jia Lu (\u6e05\u5609\u9304) recorded: \"elders give children coins threaded together by a red string, and the money is called Ya Sui Qian.\"[41] The name is still used by modern Chinese people. The lucky money was presented in one of two forms: one was coins strung on red string; the other was a colourful purse filled with coins.[42]\nIn 1928, the ruling Kuomintang party decreed that the Chinese New Year would fall on 1 Jan of the Gregorian Calendar, but this was abandoned due to overwhelming popular opposition. In 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, official Chinese New Year celebrations were banned in China. The State Council of the People's Republic of China announced that the public should \"change customs\"; have a \"revolutionized and fighting Spring Festival\"; and since people needed to work on Chinese New Year Eve, they did not need holidays during Spring Festival day. The old celebrations were reinstated in 1980.[43]\nWhile \"Chinese New Year\" remains the official name for the festival in Taiwan, the name \"Spring Festival\" was adopted by the People's Republic of China instead. On the other hand, some in the Chinese diaspora use the term \"Lunar New Year\", while \"Chinese New Year\" remains a popular and convenient translation for people of non-Chinese cultural backgrounds. Along with the Han Chinese in and outside Greater China, as many as 29 of the 55 ethnic minority groups in China also celebrate Chinese New Year. Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines celebrate it as an official festival.[44]\nChinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in some countries and territories where there is a sizeable Chinese population. Since Chinese New Year falls on different dates on the Gregorian calendar every year on different days of the week, some of these governments opt to shift working days in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. In some countries, a statutory holiday is added on the following work day if the New Year (as a public holiday) falls on a weekend, as in the case of 2013, where the New Year's Eve (9 February) falls on Saturday and the New Year's Day (10 February) on Sunday. Depending on the country, the holiday may be termed differently; common names in English are \"Chinese New Year\", \"Lunar New Year\", \"New Year Festival\", and \"Spring Festival\".\nFor New Year celebrations that are lunar but are outside of China and Chinese diaspora (such as Korea's Seollal and Vietnam's T\u1ebft), see the article on Lunar New Year.\nFor other countries and regions where Chinese New Year is celebrated but not an official holiday, see the table below.\nThe first 3 days of Chinese New Year. Extra holiday days are de facto added adjusting the weekend days before and after the three days holiday, resulting in a full week of public holiday known as Golden Week.[53][54] During the Chunyun holiday travel season.\nChinese New Year's Eve and the first 3 days of Chinese New Year; will be made up on subsequent working days if any of the 4 days fall on Saturday or Sunday. The day before Chinese New Year's Eve is also designated as holiday, but as a bridge holiday, and will be made up on an earlier or later Saturday. Additional bridge holidays may apply, resulting in 9-day or 10-day weekends.[56][57][58]\nRed couplets and red lanterns are displayed on the door frames and light up the atmosphere. The air is filled with strong Chinese emotions. In stores in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other cities, products of traditional Chinese style have started to lead fashion trend[s]. Buy yourself a Chinese-style coat, get your kids tiger-head hats and shoes, and decorate your home with some beautiful red Chinese knots, then you will have an authentic Chinese-style Spring Festival.\n\u2014 Xinwen Lianbo, January 2001, quoted by Li Ren, Imagining China in the Era of Global Consumerism and Local Consciousness[61]\nDuring the festival, people around China will prepare different gourmet dishes for their families and guests. Influenced by the flourished cultures, foods from different places look and taste totally different. Among them, the most well-known ones are dumplings from northern China and Tangyuan from southern China.[citation needed]\nOn the eighth day of the lunar month prior to Chinese New Year, the Laba holiday (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u516b; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u516b; pinyin: l\u00e0b\u0101), a traditional porridge, Laba porridge (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u516b\u7ca5; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u516b\u7ca5; pinyin: l\u00e0b\u0101 zh\u014du), is served in remembrance of an ancient festival, called La, that occurred shortly after the winter solstice.[62] Pickles such as Laba garlic, which turns green from vinegar, are also made on this day. For those that practice Buddhism, the Laba holiday is also considered Bodhi Day. Layue (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u6708; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u6708; pinyin: L\u00e0yu\u00e8) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: \u814a\u8089; traditional Chinese: \u81d8\u8089; pinyin: l\u00e0r\u00f2u). The porridge was prepared by the women of the household at first light, with the first bowl offered to the family's ancestors and the household deities. Every member of the family was then served a bowl, with leftovers distributed to relatives and friends.[63] It's still served as a special breakfast on this day in some Chinese homes. The concept of the \"La month\" is similar to Advent in Christianity. Many families eat vegetarian on Chinese New Year eve, the garlic and preserved meat are eaten on Chinese New Year day.\nReceive the Gods in Chinese New Year, (1900s)\nOn the days immediately before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their homes a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying \"Wash away the dirt on nin ya baat\" (Chinese: \u5e74\u5eff\u516b\uff0c\u6d17\u908b\u9062; pinyin: ni\u00e1n ni\u00e0n b\u0101, x\u01d0 l\u0101t\u00e0; Jyutping: nin4 jaa6 baat3, sai2 laap6 taap3 (laat6 taat3)), but the practice is not restricted to nin ya baat (the 28th day of month 12). It is believed the cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on the first day so that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away. Some people give their homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and paper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year.[64] Homes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and couplets. Purchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts need to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is considered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word \"hair\" (fa) and the word for \"prosperity\". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts outstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of gratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close business associates, and extended family members.\nIn many households where Buddhism or Taoism is observed, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly, and decorations used to adorn altars over the past year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts on Little New Year, to be replaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will also \"send gods back to heaven\" (Chinese: \u9001\u795e; pinyin: s\u00f2ngsh\u00e9n), an example would be burning a paper effigy of Zao Jun the Kitchen God, the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the Kitchen God can report to the Jade Emperor of the family household's transgressions and good deeds. Families often offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to \"bribe\" the deities into reporting good things about the family.\nPrior to the Reunion Dinner, a prayer of thanksgiving is held to mark the safe passage of the previous year. Confucianists take the opportunity to remember their ancestors, and those who had lived before them are revered. Some people do not give a Buddhist prayer due to the influence of Christianity, with a Christian prayer offered instead.\nThe day before the Chinese New Year (Chinese: \u9664\u5915) usually accompanied with a dinner feast, consisting of special meats are served at the tables, as a main course for the dinner and as an offering for the New Year. This meal is comparable to Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S. and remotely similar to Christmas dinner in other countries with a high percentage of Christians.\nIn northern China, it is customary to make jiaozi, or dumplings, after dinner to eat around midnight. Dumplings symbolize wealth because their shape resembles a Chinese sycee. In contrast, in the South, it is customary to make a glutinous new year cake (niangao) and send pieces of it as gifts to relatives and friends in the coming days. Ni\u00e1ng\u0101o [Pinyin] literally means \"new year cake\" with a homophonous meaning of \"increasingly prosperous year in year out\".[65]\nAfter dinner, some families may visit local temples hours before midnight to pray for success by lighting the first incense of the year; however in modern practice, many households held parties to celebrate. Traditionally, firecrackers were lit to ward evil spirits when the household doors sealed, and are not to be reopened until dawn in a ritual called \"opening the door of fortune\" (simplified Chinese: \u5f00\u8d22\u95e8; traditional Chinese: \u958b\u8ca1\u9580; pinyin: k\u0101ic\u00e1im\u00e9n).[66] A tradition of staying up late on Chinese New Year's Eve is known as shousui (Chinese: \u5b88\u5c81), which is still practised as it is thought to add on to one's parents' longevity.\nThe first day, known as the \"Spring Festival\" (simplified Chinese: \u6625\u8282; traditional Chinese: \u6625\u7bc0) is for the welcoming of the deities of the heavens and Earth on midnight. It is a traditional practice to light fireworks, burn bamboo sticks and firecrackers, and lion dance troupes, were done commonly as a tradition to ward off evil spirits.\nTypical actions such as lighting fires and using knives are considered taboo, thus all consumable food has to be cooked prior. Using the broom, swearing, and breaking any dinnerware without appeasing the deities are also considered taboo.[67]\nNormal traditions occurring on the first day involve house gatherings to the families, specifically the elders and families to the oldest and most senior members of their extended families, usually their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, and trading Mandarin oranges as a courtesy to symbolize wealth and good luck. Members of the family who are married also give red envelopes containing cash known as lai see (Cantonese: \u5229\u4e8b) or angpow (Hokkien and Teochew), or hongbao (Mandarin: \u7ea2\u5305), a form of a blessing and to suppress both the ageing and challenges that were associated with the coming year, to junior members of the family, mostly children and teenagers. Business managers may also give bonuses in the form of red packets to employees.[68] The money can be of any form, specifically numbers ending with 8, which sounded as huat (Mandarin: \u53d1), meaning prosperity, but packets with denominations of odd numbers or without money are usually not allowed due to bad luck, especially the number 4 which sounded as si (Mandarin: \u6b7b), which means death.[69][68]\nWhile fireworks and firecrackers are traditionally very popular, some regions have banned them due to concerns over fire hazards. For this reason, various city governments (e.g., Kowloon, Beijing, Shanghai for a number of years) issued bans over fireworks and firecrackers in certain precincts of the city. As a substitute, large-scale fireworks display have been launched by governments in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nIncense is burned at the graves of ancestors as part of the offering and prayer rituals\nThe second day, entitled \"a year's beginning\" (simplified Chinese: \u5f00\u5e74; traditional Chinese: \u958b\u5e74; pinyin: k\u0101ini\u00e1n),[70] oversees married daughters visiting their birth parents, relatives and close friends, often renew family ties and relationship. (Traditionally, married daughters didn't have the opportunity to visit their birth families frequently.)\nThe second day also saw giving offering money and sacrifices to God of Wealth (Chinese: \u8d22\u795e) to symbolize a rewarding time after hardship in the preceding year. During the days of imperial China, \"beggars and other unemployed people circulate[d] from family to family, carrying a picture [of the God of Wealth] shouting, \"Cai Shen dao!\" [The God of Wealth has come!].\"[71] Householders would respond with \"lucky money\" to reward the messengers. Business people of the Cantonese dialect group will hold a 'Hoi Nin' prayer to start their business on the second day of Chinese New Year, blessing business to strive in the coming year.\nThe third day is known as \"red mouth\" (Chinese: \u8d64\u53e3; pinyin: Ch\u00eck\u01d2u). Chikou is also called \"Chigou's Day\" (Chinese: \u8d64\u72d7\u65e5; pinyin: Ch\u00ecg\u01d2ur\u00ec). Chigou, literally \"red dog\", is an epithet of \"the God of Blazing Wrath\" (Chinese: \u719b\u6012\u4e4b\u795e; pinyin: Bi\u0101o n\u00f9 zh\u012b sh\u00e9n). Rural villagers continue the tradition of burning paper offerings over trash fires. It is considered an unlucky day to have guests or go visiting.[72] Hakka villagers in rural Hong Kong in the 1960s called it the Day of the Poor Devil and believed everyone should stay at home.[73] This is also considered a propitious day to visit the temple of the God of Wealth and have one's future told.\nIn those communities that celebrate Chinese New Year for 15 days, the fourth day is when corporate \"spring dinners\" kick off and business returns to normal. Other areas that have a longer Chinese New Year holiday will celebrate and welcome the gods that were previously sent on this day.\nThis day is the god of Wealth's birthday. In northern China, people eat jiaozi, or dumplings, on the morning of powu (Chinese: \u7834\u4e94; pinyin: p\u00f2w\u01d4). In Taiwan, businesses traditionally re-open on the next day (the sixth day), accompanied by firecrackers.\nIt is also common in China that on the 5th day people will shoot off firecrackers to get Guan Yu's attention, thus ensuring his favour and good fortune for the new year.[74]\nThe sixth day is Horse's Day, on which people drive away the Ghost of Poverty by throwing out the garbage stored up during the festival. The ways vary but basically have the same meaning\u2014to drive away the Ghost of Poverty, which reflects the general desire of the Chinese people to ring out the old and ring in the new, to send away the previous poverty and hardship and to usher in the good life of the New Year.[75]\nThe seventh day, traditionally known as Renri (the common person's birthday), is the day when everyone grows one year older. In some overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Singapore, it is also the day when tossed raw fish salad, yusheng, is eaten for continued wealth and prosperity.\nFor many Chinese Buddhists, this is another day to avoid meat, the seventh day commemorating the birth of Sakra, lord of the devas in Buddhist cosmology who is analogous to the Jade Emperor.\nAnother family dinner is held to celebrate the eve of the birth of the Jade Emperor, the ruler of heaven. People normally return to work by the eighth day, therefore the Store owners will host a lunch/dinner with their employees, thanking their employees for the work they have done for the whole year.\nThe ninth day is traditionally known as the birthday of the Jade Emperor of Heaven (Chinese: \u7389\u7687; pinyin: Y\u00f9 Hu\u00e1ng) and many people offered prayer in the Taoist Pantheon as thanks or gratitude.,[76] and it is commonly known as called Ti Kong Dan (Chinese: \u5929\u516c\u8a95; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Thi\u207f-kong Tan), Ti Kong Si (Chinese: \u5929\u516c\u751f; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Thi\u207f-kong Si\u207f/Thi\u207f-kong Se\u207f) or Pai Ti Kong (Chinese: \u62dc\u5929\u516c; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: P\u00e0i Thi\u207f-kong), which is especially important to Hokkiens other than the first day of the Chinese New Year.[77]\nA prominent requisite offering is sugarcane.[77] Legends holds that the Hokkien were spared from a massacre by Japanese pirates by hiding in a sugarcane plantation between the eighth and ninth days of the Chinese New Year, coinciding with the Jade Emperor's birthday.[77] \"Sugarcane\" (Chinese: \u7518\u8517; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: kam-chi\u00e0) is a near homonym to \"thank you\" (Chinese: \u611f\u8b1d; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: k\u00e1m-si\u0101) in the Hokkien dialect.[77]\nIn the morning (traditionally anytime between midnight and 7 am), Taiwanese households set up an altar table with three layers: one top (containing offertories of six vegetables (Chinese: \u516d\u9f4b; pinyin: li\u00f9 zh\u0101i; those being noodles, fruits, cakes, tangyuan, vegetable bowls, and unripe betel), all decorated with paper lanterns) and two lower levels (five sacrifices and wines) to honour the deities below the Jade Emperor.[76] The household then kneels three times and kowtows nine times to pay obeisance and wish him a long life.[76]\nIncense, tea, fruit, vegetarian food or roast pig, and gold paper, are served as a customary protocol for paying respect to an honoured person.\nThe fifteenth day of the new year is celebrated as the Lantern Festival, also known as the Yuanxiao Festival (simplified Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5\u8282; traditional Chinese: \u5143\u5bb5\u7bc0; pinyin: Yu\u00e1n xi\u0101o ji\u00e9), the Shangyuan Festival (simplified Chinese: \u4e0a\u5143\u8282; traditional Chinese: \u4e0a\u5143\u7bc0; pinyin: Sh\u00e0ng yu\u00e1n ji\u00e9), and Chap Goh Meh (Chinese: \u5341\u4e94\u669d; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Cha\u030dp-g\u014d\u0358-m\u00ea; lit. 'the fifteen night' in Hokkien). Rice dumplings, or tangyuan (simplified Chinese: \u6c64\u5706; traditional Chinese: \u6e6f\u5713; pinyin: tang yu\u00e1n), a sweet glutinous rice ball brewed in a soup, are eaten this day. Candles are lit outside houses as a way to guide wayward spirits home. Families may walk the streets carrying lanterns, which sometimes have riddles attached to or written on them as a tradition.[78]\nIn China and Malaysia, this day is celebrated by individuals seeking a romantic partner, akin to Valentine's Day.[79] Nowadays, single women write their contact number on mandarin oranges and throw them in a river or a lake after which single men collect the oranges and eat them. The taste is an indication of their possible love: sweet represents a good fate while sour represents a bad fate.\nA reunion dinner (ni\u00e1n y\u00e8 f\u00e0n) is held on New Year's Eve during which family members gather for a celebration.[80] The venue will usually be in or near the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and sumptuous and traditionally includes dishes of meat (namely, pork and chicken) and fish. Most reunion dinners also feature a communalhot pot as it is believed to signify the coming together of the family members for the meal. Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also prominently feature speciality meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and Chinese sausage) and seafood (e.g. lobster and abalone) that are usually reserved for this and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most areas, fish (simplified Chinese: \u9c7c; traditional Chinese: \u9b5a; pinyin: y\u00fa) is included, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase \"may there be surpluses every year\" (simplified Chinese: \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59; traditional Chinese: \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918; pinyin: ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa) sounds the same as \"let there be fish every year.\" Eight individual dishes are served to reflect the belief of good fortune associated with the number. If in the previous year a death was experienced in the family, seven dishes are served.\nOther traditional foods consists of noodles, fruits, dumplings,[81] spring rolls,[82] and Tangyuan[80] which are also known as sweet rice balls. Each dish served during Chinese New Year represents something special. The noodles used to make longevity noodles are usually very thin, long wheat noodles. These noodles are longer than normal noodles that are usually fried and served on a plate, or boiled and served in a bowl with its broth. The noodles symbolize the wish for a long life. The fruits that are typically selected would be oranges, tangerines, and pomelos as they are round and \"golden\" color symbolizing fullness and wealth. Their lucky sound when spoken also brings good luck and fortune. The Chinese pronunciation for orange is \u6a59 (ch\u00e9ng), which sounds the same as the Chinese for 'success' (\u6210). One of the ways to spell tangerine(\u6854 j\u00fa) contains the Chinese character for luck (\u5409 j\u00ed). Pomelos are believed to bring constant prosperity. Pomelo in Chinese (\u67da y\u00f2u) sounds similar to 'to have' (\u6709 y\u01d2u), disregarding its tone, however it sounds exactly like 'again' (\u53c8 y\u00f2u). Dumplings and spring rolls symbolize wealth, whereas sweet rice balls symbolize family togetherness.\nRed packets for the immediate family are sometimes distributed during the reunion dinner. These packets contain money in an amount that reflects good luck and honorability. Several foods are consumed to usher in wealth, happiness, and good fortune. Several of the Chinese food names are homophones for words that also mean good things.\nMany families in China still follow the tradition of eating only vegetarian food on the first day of the New Year, as it is believed that doing so will bring good luck into their lives for the whole year.[83]\nLike many other New Year dishes, certain ingredients also take special precedence over others as these ingredients also have similar-sounding names with prosperity, good luck, or even counting money.\nAn elaborate vegetarian dish served by Chinese families on the eve and the first day of the New Year. A type of black hair-like algae, pronounced \"fat choy\" in Cantonese, is also featured in the dish for its name, which sounds like \"prosperity\". Hakkas usually serve kiu nyuk (Chinese: \u6263\u8089; pinyin: k\u00f2ur\u00f2u) and ngiong teu fu.\nChicken\n\u9e21\n\u96de\nJ\u012b\nBoiled chicken is served because it is figured that any family, no matter how humble their circumstances, can afford a chicken for Chinese New Year.\nApples\n\u82f9\u679c\n\u860b\u679c\nP\u00ednggu\u01d2\nApples symbolize peace because the word for apple (\"ping\") is a homonym of the word for peace.\nFish\n\u9c7c\n\u9b5a\nY\u00fa\nIs usually eaten or merely displayed on the eve of Chinese New Year. The pronunciation of fish makes it a homophone for \"surpluses\"(simplified Chinese: \u4f59; traditional Chinese: \u9918; pinyin: y\u00fa).\nIs usually served in a dish with rondelles of Chinese sausage or Chinese cured meat during Chinese New Year. The pronunciation of Garlic makes it a homophone for \"calculating (money)\" (Chinese: \u7b97; pinyin: su\u00e0n). The Chinese cured meat is so chosen because it is traditionally the primary method for storing meat over the winter and the meat rondelles resemble coins.\nThe common dumpling eaten in northern China, also believed to resemble sycee. In the reunion dinner, Chinese people add various food into Jiaozi fillings to represent good fortune: coin, Niangao, dried date, candy, etc.\nMost popular in eastern China (Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai) because its pronunciation is a homophone for \"a more prosperous year (\u5e74\u9ad8 lit. year high)\". Niangao is also popular in the Philippines because of its large Chinese population and is known as tikoy (Chinese: \u751c\u7cbf, from Min Nan) there. Known as Chinese New Year pudding, niangao is made up of glutinous rice flour, wheat starch, salt, water, and sugar. The color of the sugar used determines the color of the pudding (white or brown).\nRaw fish salad. Eating this salad is said to bring good luck. This dish is usually eaten on the seventh day of the New Year, but may also be eaten throughout the period.\nFive Xinpan\n\u4e94\u8f9b\u76d8\n\u4e94\u8f9b\u76e4\nW\u01d4 x\u012bnp\u00e1n\nFive Xin include onion, garlic, pepper, ginger, mustard. As an ancient traditional folk culture, it has been existing since the Jin dynasty. It symbolizes health. In a well-economic development dynasty, like Song, The Five Xinpan not only have five spicy vegetables. Also, include Chinese bacon and other vegetables. Moreover, it offered to the family's ancestors to express respect and seek a blessing.[86]\nThis dish is eaten on Laba Festival, the eighth day of the twelfth month of the Chinese lunar calendar. The congees are made of mixed walnut, pine nuts, mushrooms, persimmon. The congees are for commemorating the sacrifices of ancestors and celebrating the harvest.[87]\nTraditionally, red envelopes or red packets\n(traditional Chinese: \u7d05\u5305; simplified Chinese: \u7ea2\u5305; Mandarinpinyin: h\u00f3ngb\u0101o; HokkienPe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: \u00e2ng-pau; HakkaPha\u030dk-fa-s\u1e73: f\u00f9ng-p\u00e2u), alternatively known as lai see particularly in Cantonese speaking areas (Chinese: \u5229\u662f / \u5229\u5e02 / \u5229\u4e8b; Cantonese Yale: laih sih; pinyin: l\u00ecsh\u00ec), are passed out during the Chinese New Year's celebrations, from married couples or the elderly to unmarried juniors or children. During this period, red packets are also known as yasuiqian (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322; \u538b\u5c81\u94b1; y\u0101su\u00ecqi\u00e1n), which was evolved from a homophonous phrase yasuiqian (\u58d3\u795f\u9322; \u538b\u795f\u94b1; y\u0101su\u00ecqi\u00e1n), literally meaning \"money to suppress evil spirits\".[88] According to legend, a demon named Sui patted a child on the head three times on New Year's Eve, and the child would have a fever. The parents wrapped coins in red paper and placed them next to their children's pillows. When Sui came, the flash of the coin scared him away. From then on, every New Year's Eve, parents will wrap the coin in red paper to protect their children.[89]\nRed packets almost always contain money, usually varying from a couple of dollars to several hundred. Chinese superstitions favour amounts that begin with even numbers, such as 8 (\u516b, pinyin: b\u0101), a homophone for \"wealth\", and 6 (\u516d, pinyin: li\u00f9), a homophone for \"smooth\"\u2014but not the number 4 (\u56db, pinyin: s\u00ec), which is a homophone of \"death\", and is, as such, considered unlucky in Asian culture. Odd numbers are also avoided, as they are associated with cash given during funerals (\u5e1b\u91d1, pinyin: b\u00e1ij\u012bn).[90][91] It is also customary for bills placed inside a red envelope to be new.[92]\nThe act of asking for red packets (Mandarin: \u8a0e\u7d05\u5305; t\u01ceo h\u00f3ngb\u0101o, Cantonese: \u9017\u5229\u662f; dauh laih sih) wouldn't be turned down by a married person as it would mean that he or she would be \"out of luck\" in the new year. Red packets are generally given by married couples to the younger non-married members of the family.[82] It is custom and polite for children to wish elders a happy new year and a year of happiness, health and good fortune before accepting the red envelope.[82] Red envelopes are then kept under the pillow and slept on for seven nights after Chinese New Year before opening because that symbolizes good luck and fortune.\nIn Taiwan in the 2000s, some employers also gave red packets as a bonus to maids, nurses or domestic workers from Southeast Asian countries, although whether this is appropriate is controversial.[93][94]\nIn ancient times, there was a monster named sui (\u795f) which comes out on New Year's Eve and touches the heads of sleeping children. The child will be frightened by the touch and wake up and have a fever. The fever eventually will cause the child to have intellectual disabilities. Hence, families will light up their homes and stay awake, leading to a tradition of shou sui (\u5b88\u795f), to guard against sui harming their children.\nA folklore tale of sui is about an elderly couple with a precious son. On the night of New Year's Eve, since they were afraid that sui would come, they took out eight pieces of copper coins to play with their son in order to keep him awake. Their son was very sleepy, however, so they let him go to sleep after placing a red paper bag containing the copper coins under the child's pillow. The two older children also stayed with him for the whole night. Suddenly, the doors and windows were blown open by a strange wind, and even the candlelight was extinguished. It turned out to be a sui. When the sui was going to reach out and touch the child's head, the pillow suddenly brightened with the golden light, and the sui was scared away, so the exorcism effect of \"red paper wrapped copper money\" spread in the past China[99] (see also Chinese numismatic charms). The money is then called \"ya sui qian (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322)\", the money to suppress sui.\nAnother tale is that a huge demon was terrorizing a village and there was nobody in the village who was able to defeat the demon; many warriors and statesmen had tried with no luck. A young orphan stepped in, armed with a magical sword that was inherited from his ancestors, and battled the demon, eventually killing it. Peace was finally restored to the village, and the elders all presented the brave young man with a red envelope filled with money to repay the young orphan for his courage and for ridding the village of the demon.[100]\nIn addition to red envelopes, which are usually given from older people to younger people, small gifts (usually food or sweets) are also exchanged between friends or relatives (of different households) during Chinese New Year. Gifts are usually brought when visiting friends or relatives at their homes. Common gifts include fruits (typically oranges, but never trade pears), cakes, biscuits, chocolates, and candies. Gifts are preferred to be wrapped with red or golden paper, which symbolizes good luck.\nCertain items should not be given, as they are considered taboo. Taboo gifts include:[101][102][103]\nitems that symbolize that you want to walk away from a relationship (examples: shoes and sandals)\nmirrors\nhomonyms for unpleasant topics (examples: \"clock\" sounds like \"the funeral ritual\" or \"the end of life\", green hats because \"wear a green hat\" sounds like \"cuckold\", \"handkerchief\" sounds like \"goodbye\", \"pear\" sounds like \"separate\", \"umbrella\" sounds like \"disperse\", and \"shoe\" sounds like a \"rough\" year).\nMarkets or village fairs are set up as the New Year is approaching. These usually open-air markets feature new year related products such as flowers, toys, clothing, and even fireworks and firecrackers. It is convenient for people to buy gifts for their new year visits as well as their home decorations. In some places, the practice of shopping for the perfect plum tree is not dissimilar to the Western tradition of buying a Christmas tree.\nA Chinese man setting off fireworks during Chinese New Year in Shanghai\nBamboo stems filled with gunpowder that was burnt to create small explosions were once used in ancient China to drive away evil spirits. In modern times, this method has eventually evolved into the use of firecrackers during the festive season. Firecrackers are usually strung on a long fused string so it can be hung down. Each firecracker is rolled up in red papers, as red is auspicious, with gunpowder in its core. Once ignited, the firecracker lets out a loud popping noise and, as they are usually strung together by the hundreds, the firecrackers are known for their deafening explosions that are thought to scare away evil spirits. The burning of firecrackers also signifies a joyful time of year and has become an integral aspect of Chinese New Year celebrations.[104] Since the 2000s, firecrackers have been banned in various countries and towns.\n\"Happy New Year!\" (Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u597d\u5440; pinyin: X\u012bn Ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo Ya) is a popular children's song for the New Year holiday.[105] The melody is similar to the American folk song, Oh My Darling, Clementine. Another popular Chinese New Year song is Gong Xi Gong Xi(Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u606d\u559c\uff01; pinyin: Gongxi Gongxi!)\n.\nWatching Chinese New Year films is an expression of Chinese cultural identity. During the New Year holidays, the stage boss gathers the most popular actors whom from various troupes let them perform repertories from Qing dynasty. Nowadays many people celebrate the new year by watching these movies.[106]\nThe color red is commonly worn throughout Chinese New Year; traditional beliefs held that red could scare away evil spirits.[82] The wearing of new clothes is another clothing custom during the festival;[107] the new clothes symbolize a new beginning in the year.[82]\nIn some places, the taking of a family portrait is an important ceremony after the relatives are gathered.[108] The photo is taken at the hall of the house or taken in front of the house. The most senior male head of the family sits in the center.\nAs with all cultures, Chinese New Year traditions incorporate elements that are symbolic of deeper meaning. One common example of Chinese New Year symbolism is the red diamond-shaped fu characters (Chinese: \u798f; pinyin: f\u00fa; Cantonese Yale: f\u016bk; lit. 'blessings', 'happiness'), which are displayed on the entrances of Chinese homes. This sign is usually seen hanging upside down, since the Chinese word for \"upside down\" (\u5012; d\u00e0o), is homophonous or nearly homophonous with the word for \"arrive\" (\u5230; d\u00e0o) in all varieties of Chinese. Therefore, it symbolizes the arrival of luck, happiness, and prosperity.\nFor Cantonese-speaking people, if the fu sign is hung upside down, the implied dao (upside down) sounds like the Cantonese word for \"pour\", producing \"pour the luck [away]\", which would usually symbolize bad luck; this is why the fu character is not usually hung upside-down in Cantonese communities.\nRed is the predominant color used in New Year celebrations. Red is the emblem of joy, and this color also symbolizes virtue, truth and sincerity. On the Chinese opera stage, a painted red face usually denotes a sacred or loyal personage and sometimes a great emperor. Candies, cakes, decorations and many things associated with the New Year and its ceremonies are coloured red. The sound of the Chinese word for \"red\" (pinyin: h\u00f3ng; Cantonese Yale: h\u00fang) is in Mandarin homophonous with the word for \"prosperous.\" Therefore, red is an auspicious color and has an auspicious sound.\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the year of the pig is a generally unlucky year for the public, which is why you need to reevaluate most of your decisions before you reach a conclusion. However, this only helps you get even more control over your life as you learn to stay ahead of everything by being cautious.[109]\nNianhua can be a form of Chinese coloured woodblock printing, for decoration during Chinese New Year.[110] Nianhua uses a range of subjects to express and invite positive prospects as the new year begins. The most popular representatives of these prospects take inspiration from nature, religion, folklore, etc., and are portrayed in flashy and lively ways.[111]\nrepresents fertility and abundance, as well as good taste, beauty, luxury and innocence\nEach flower has a symbolic meaning, and many Chinese people believe that it may usher in the values that it represents.[112] In general, except those in lucky colour like red and yellow, chrysanthemum should not be put at home during the new year, because it is normally used for ancestral veneration.[113]\nThese lanterns that differ from those of Mid-Autumn Festival in general. They will be red in color and tend to be oval in shape. These are the traditional Chinese paper lanterns. Those lanterns, used on the fifteenth day of the Chinese New Year for the Lantern Festival, are bright, colorful, and in many different sizes and shapes.\nDragon and lion dances are common during Chinese New Year. It is believed that the loud beats of the drum and the deafening sounds of the cymbals together with the face of the Dragon or lion dancing aggressively can evict bad or evil spirits. Lion dances are also popular for opening of businesses in Hong Kong and Macau.\nTraditionally, families gather together during the Chinese New Year. In modern China, migrant workers in China travel home to have reunion dinners with their families on Chinese New Year's Eve. Owing to a large number of interprovincial travellers, special arrangements were made by railways, buses and airlines starting from 15 days before the New Year's Day. This 40-day period is called chunyun, and is known as the world's largest annual migration.[114] More interurban trips are taken in China in this period than the total population of China.\nIn Taiwan, spring travel is also a major event. The majority of transportation in western Taiwan is in a north\u2013south direction: long-distance travel between urbanized north and hometowns in the rural south. Transportation in eastern Taiwan and that between Taiwan and its islands is less convenient. Cross-strait flights between Taiwan and China began in 2003 as part of Three Links, mostly for \"Taiwanese businessmen\" to return to Taiwan for the new year.[115]\nDecorations on the occasion of Chinese New Year \u2013 River Hongbao 2016, Singapore\nChinese New Year is also celebrated annually in many countries which houses significant Chinese populations. These include countries throughout Asia, Oceania, and North America. Sydney,[116] London,[117] and San Francisco[118] claim to host the largest New Year celebration outside of Asia and South America.\nIn Singapore, Chinese New Year is officially a two-day public holiday. Chinese New Year is accompanied by various festive activities. One of the main highlights is the Chinatown celebrations. In 2010, this included a Festive Street Bazaar, nightly staged shows at Kreta Ayer Square and a lion dance competition.[120] The Chingay Parade also features prominently in the celebrations. It is an annual street parade in Singapore, well known for its colourful floats and wide variety of cultural performances.[121] The highlights of the Parade for 2011 include a Fire Party, multi-ethnic performances and an unprecedented travelling dance competition.[122]\nIn the Philippines, Chinese New Year (Philippine Hokkien Chinese: \u54b1\u4eba\u5e74\u515c; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: L\u00e1n-n\u00e2ng N\u00ee-tau) is considered as one of the important festivals for Chinese Filipinos, and its celebration has also extended to the majority non-Chinese Filipinos, especially since in 2012, Chinese New Year was included as a public regular non-working holiday in the Philippines. During this time of year, the selling or giving of Tikoy, especially by Chinese Filipinos, is widely known and practised in the country. Celebrations are centered primarily in Binondo in Manila, the oldest ever Chinatown in the world, with other celebrations in key cities.\nIn Indonesia, the Chinese New Year is officially named Tahun Baru Imlek (Chinese: \u9670\u66c6\u65b0\u5e74; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: im-le\u030dk sin-n\u00ee), with \"Imlek\" deriving from the Hokkien word for \"Lunar Calendar\" (Chinese: \u9670\u66c6; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: im-le\u030dk).[123][124] It is known locally in Hokkien as Sin Cia (Chinese: \u65b0\u6b63; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: sin-chia\u207f).[125] It was celebrated as one of the official national religious holiday by Chinese Indonesians since 18 June 1946 to 1 January 1953 through government regulation signed by President Sukarno on 18 June 1946.[126] It was unofficially celebrated by ethnic Chinese from 1953 to 1967 based on government regulation signed by Vice-President Muhammad Hatta on 5 February 1953 which annul the previous regulation, among others, the Chinese New Year as a national religious holiday.[127]\nEffectively from 6 December 1967,[128] until 1998, the spiritual practice to celebrate the Chinese New Year by Chinese families was restricted specifically only inside of the Chinese house. This restriction is made by the New Order government through a Presidential Instruction No. 14 of 1967 signed by President Suharto. This restriction is ended when the regime has changed and the President Suharto was overthrown. The celebration was conducted unofficially by Chinese community from 1999 to 2000.\nOn 17 January 2000, the President Abdurrahman Wahid issued Presidential Decree No. 6 of 2000 to annul the previous instruction.[129] On 19 January 2001, the Ministry of Religious Affairs issued Minsterial Decree No.13 of 2001 on Imlek Day as a National Holiday to set Hari Tahun Baru Imlek as a \"facultative holiday\" for Chinese community.[130] Through the Presidential Decree it was officially declared as a 1 (one) day public religious holiday as of 9 April 2002 by President Megawati.[124] The Indonesian government authorize only the first day of the Chinese New Year as a public religious holiday and it is specifically designated only for Chinese people.[123][124][126][127][131]\nIn Indonesia, the first day of the Chinese New Year is recognized as a part of the celebration of the Chinese religion and tradition of Chinese community.[123][124][126][127][130] There are no other official or unofficial of the Chinese New Year as a public holiday. The remaining 14 days are celebrated only by ethnic Chinese families.[132] In Indonesia, the Chinese Year is named as a year of K\u01d2ngz\u01d0 (Chinese: \u5b54\u5b50) or Kongzili in Indonesian. Every year, the Ministry of Religious Affairs set the specific date of religious holiday based on input from religious leaders.[132] The Chinese New Year is the only national religious holiday in Indonesia that was enacted specifically with the Presidential Decree, in this case with the Presidential Decree No. 19 of 2002 dated on 9 April 2002.[123][124] The celebration of the Chinese New Year as a religious holiday is specifically intended only for Chinese people in Indonesia (tradisi masyarakat Cina yang dirayakan secara turun temurun di berbagai wilayah di Indonesia,[124]dan umat Agama Tionghoa[126]) and it is not intended to be celebrated by native Indonesians.[123][124][126][127][128][130]\nObserved by Thai Chinese and parts of the private sector, the festival is usually celebrated for three days, starting on the day before Chinese New Year's Eve. Chinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, Satun[60] and Songkhla[136] Provinces. For the year 2021 (one year only) the government declared Chinese New Year a government holiday. It applies mostly to civil servants, financial institutions and private businesses can decide whether or not to observe it.[137]\nDivided into 3 days, the first day is the Wan chai (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e08\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22; pay day), meaning the day that people go out to shop for offerings, the second day is the Wan wai (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e49; worship day), is a day of worshiping the gods and ancestral spirits, which is divided into three periods: dawn, late morning and afternoon, the third day is a Wan tieow (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e27; holiday), is a holiday where everyone will leave the house to travel or to bless relatives or respectable people, often wearing red clothes which is believed to bring auspiciousness to life.[138]\nWith one of the largest Chinese populations outside of Asia, Sydney also claims to have the largest Chinese New Year Celebrations outside of Asia with over 600,000 people attending the celebrations in Chinatown annually. The events there span over three weeks including the launch celebration, outdoor markets, evening street food stalls, Chinese top opera performances, dragon boat races, a film festival and multiple parades that incorporate Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese people. More than 100,000 people attend notably the main parade with over 3,500 performers.[142] The festival also attracts international media coverage, reaching millions of viewers in Asia.[143] The festival in Sydney is organized in partnership with a different Chinese province each year. Apart from Sydney, other state capital cities in Australia also celebrate Chinese New Year due to large number of Chinese residents.[144] The cities include: Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne Box Hill and Perth. The common activities are lion dance, dragon dance, New Year market, and food festival. In the Melbourne suburb of Footscray, Victoria a Lunar New Year celebration initially focusing on the Vietnamese New Year has expanded into a celebration of the Chinese New Year as well as the April New Year celebrations of the Thais, Cambodians, Laotians and other Asian Australian communities who celebrate the New Year in either January/February or April.[145]\nMultiple groups in New York City cooperate to sponsor a week-long Lunar New Year celebration. The festivities include cultural festival,[148] music concert,[156] fireworks on the Hudson River near the Chinese Consulate,[157] and special exhibits.[156] One of the key celebrations is the Chinese New Year parade[158] with floats and fireworks taking place along the streets in Chinatown, Manhattan, the largest Chinese New Year parade outside Asia.[159] In June 2015, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that the Lunar New Year would be made a public school holiday.[160]\nThe festival incorporates Grant and Kearny Streets into its street festival and parade route, respectively. The use of these streets traces its lineage back to early parades beginning the custom in San Francisco. In 1849, with the discovery of gold and the ensuing California Gold Rush, over 50,000 people had come to San Francisco to seek their fortune or just a better way of life. Among those were many Chinese, who had come to work in the gold mines and on the railroad. By the 1860s, the residents of San Francisco's Chinatown were eager to share their culture with their fellow San Francisco residents who may have been unfamiliar with (or hostile towards) it. The organizers chose to showcase their culture by using a favourite American tradition \u2013 the parade. They invited a variety of other groups from the city to participate, and they marched down what today are Grant Avenue and Kearny Street carrying colourful flags, banners, lanterns, drums, and firecrackers to drive away evil spirits.\nIn San Francisco, over 100 units participate in the annual Chinese New Year Parade held since 1958.[162] The parade is attended by some 500,000 people along with another 3 million TV viewers.[163]\nThe Golden Dragon Parade has happened annually in Chinatown Los Angeles since 1899, one of the oldest and largest Chinese New Year parades outside of Asia. Beginning in the 1970s, famous Asian American actors have held the title of Grand Marshall of the parade, the first being Bruce Lee.[164]\nAround Southern California many communities also put on festivals and parades that can last multiple days, with some of the largest occurring in the San Gabriel Valley, home to the largest Chinese community outside of Asia and often called the first suburban Chinatown, and Little Saigon where many Vietnamese and Chinese live. Monterey Park puts on the largest of such festivals, occupying 5 blocks in the city and attracting over 100,000 individuals.[165] Neighboring Alhambra also has hosted a large festival since 1993 with many performances and street vendors.[166]San Gabriel hosts an annual Chinese Gala at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse in addition to its street festival.[167]\nMany people also celebrate by going to temples across Southern California, and the largest temple celebration is held at Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights.[170] Most major shopping malls will also decorate for Chinese New Year.[171]\nDisneyland California Adventure in Anaheim celebrates Chinese New Year by decorating certain areas of the park in Chinese displays, serving speciality East Asian foods and allowing for character photos with Mulan, Mushu, Raya, Tigger and Mickey and Minnie Mouse in Chinese Costumes.[172]\nIn London, celebrations take place in Chinatown, Leicester Square, and Trafalgar Square. Festivities include a parade, cultural feast, fireworks, concerts, and performances.[173] The celebration attracts between 300,000 and 500,000 people yearly according to the organisers.[174]\nIn Paris, celebrations have been held since the 1980s in several districts during one month with many performances[175] and the main of the three parades with 40 groups and 4,000 performers is attended alone by more than 200,000 people in the 13th arrondissement.[176][177]\nIn Pakistan, the Chinese New Year is also celebrated among the sizeable Chinese expatriate community that lives in the country. During the festival, the Chinese embassy in Islamabad arranges various cultural events in which Pakistani arts and cultural organizations and members of the civil society also participate.[182][183][184][185]\nChinese culture in Mauritius is an important component of the multiculturalism in Mauritius.[186] Despite the small size of the Sino-Mauritian community (estimated to be only about 3% of the total population),[187] Chinese New Year (also known as Chinese Spring Festival) is a time where Chinese culture is celebrated on the island[188] and is a public holiday in Mauritius.[189] Mauritius is also the only country in Africa which lists the Chinese Spring Festival as a statutory public holiday.[186] During this period of the year, there is a joyful and festive atmosphere throughout the entire country.[186]\nSino-Mauritians are very attached to Chinese traditions.[190] The Chinese Spring Festival is the biggest celebration for the Sino-Mauritians on the island.[190] The dates of the celebration follows the Chinese lunar calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar.[190] During the week prior to the New Year's Day, spring cleaning in homes is performed.The festival starts on Chinese New Year's Eve by lighting on firecrackers to ward off evil spirits.[191]: 71 Traditionalist visit pagodas to offer offerings and prayers on the New Year's Eve.[191]: 71 Following Chinese customs, there is a big family dinner on the New Year's Eve.[190][192] While the family dinner was traditionally celebrated at the house of the oldest family parents, going to restaurants for New Year's Eve is getting more popular; some restaurants may also have special dinners across the island to foster the family reunions of Sino-Mauritians.[190] After the New year's Eve dinner, youths often go to nightclubs.[190] On the day of the Chinese New Year, it is customary for Sino-Mauritian to share niangao to their relatives and friends and to lit firecrackers to ward off evil spirits.[189][190] Red envelopes are also given. Some families would also visit pagoda on New Year to honour their ancestors.[190] Some families observe a vegetarian diet on the New Year.[192] The main celebration events typically take place in the Chinatown area in Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius.[189][193] The Dragon dance and the Southern Lion dance is also customary on that day.[190][192] The colour red is predominantly used to decorate the streets and houses. Chinese items (e.g. Chinese lanterns) are also used as decorations.[193]\nThe Chinese New Year is often accompanied by loud, enthusiastic greetings, often referred to as \u5409\u7965\u8a71 (j\u00edxi\u00e1nghu\u00e0) in Mandarin or \u5409\u5229\u8aaa\u8a71 (Kat Lei Seut Wa) in Cantonese, loosely translated as auspicious words or phrases. New Year couplets printed in gold letters on bright red paper, referred to as chunlian (\u6625\u806f) or fai chun (\u63ee\u6625), is another way of expressing auspicious new year wishes. They probably predate the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), but did not become widespread until then.[194] Today, they are ubiquitous with Chinese New Year.\nSome of the most common greetings include:\nXin nian kuai le / San nin fai lok: simplified Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u4e50; traditional Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u6a02; pinyin: X\u012bnni\u00e1nku\u00e0il\u00e8; Jyutping: san1 nin4 faai3 lok6; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Sin-n\u00ee kh\u00f2ai-lo\u030dk; Hakka: Sin Ngen Kai Lok; Taishanese: Slin Nen Fai Lok. A more contemporary greeting reflective of Western influences, it literally translates from the greeting \"Happy new year\" more common in the west. It is written in English as \"xin nian kuai le\".[195] In northern parts of China, traditionally people say simplified Chinese: \u8fc7\u5e74\u597d; traditional Chinese: \u904e\u5e74\u597d; pinyin: Gu\u00f2ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo instead of simplified Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u4e50; traditional Chinese: \u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u6a02 (X\u012bnni\u00e1nku\u00e0ile), to differentiate it from the international new year. And \u904e\u5e74\u597d (Gu\u00f2ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo) can be used from the first day to the fifth day of Chinese New Year. However, \u904e\u5e74\u597d (Gu\u00f2ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo) is considered very short and therefore somewhat discourteous. Gong Hei Fat Choi at Lee Theatre Plaza, Hong Kong\nGong xi fa cai / Gong hei fat choi: simplified Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22; traditional Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1; pinyin: G\u014dngx\u01d0f\u0101c\u00e1i; Hokkien: Kiong hee huat chai (POJ: Kiong-h\u00ed hoat-ch\u00e2i); Cantonese: Gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4; Hakka: Gung hee fatt choi, which loosely translates to \"Congratulations and be prosperous\". It is spelled varyingly in English, such as \"Gung hay fat choy\",[196] \"gong hey fat choi\",[195] or \"Kung Hei Fat Choy\".[197] It is often mistakenly assumed to be synonymous with \"Happy New Year\". The saying is now commonly heard in English speaking communities for greetings during Chinese New Year in parts of the world where there is a sizable Chinese-speaking community, including overseas Chinese communities that have been resident for several generations, relatively recent immigrants from Greater China, and those who are transit migrants (particularly students).\nNumerous other greetings exist, some of which may be exclaimed out loud to no one in particular in specific situations. For example, as breaking objects during the new year is considered inauspicious, one may then say \u6b72\u6b72\u5e73\u5b89 (Su\u00ecsu\u00ec-p\u00edng'\u0101n) immediately, which means \"everlasting peace year after year\". Su\u00ec (\u6b72), meaning \"age\" is homophonous with \u788e (su\u00ec) (meaning \"shatter\"), in the demonstration of the Chinese love for wordplay in auspicious phrases. Similarly, \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918 (ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa), a wish for surpluses and bountiful harvests every year, plays on the word y\u00fa that can also refer to \u9b5a (y\u00fa meaning fish), making it a catch phrase for fish-based Chinese new year dishes and for paintings or graphics of fish that are hung on walls or presented as gifts.\nThe most common auspicious greetings and sayings consist of four characters, such as the following:\nThese greetings or phrases may also be used just before children receive their red packets, when gifts are exchanged, when visiting temples, or even when tossing the shredded ingredients of yusheng particularly popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Children and their parents can also pray in the temple, in hopes of getting good blessings for the new year to come.\nChildren and teenagers sometimes jokingly use the phrase \"\u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff0c\u7d05\u5305\u62ff\u4f86\" (pinyin: g\u014dngx\u01d0f\u0101c\u00e1i, h\u00f3ngb\u0101o n\u00e1l\u00e1i; Cantonese: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86; Jyutping: gung1hei2 faat3coi4, lei6 si6 dau6 loi4), roughly translated as \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope!\". In Hakka the saying is more commonly said as 'Gung hee fatt choi, hung bao diu loi' which would be written as \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff0c\u7d05\u5305\u9017\u4f86 \u2013 a mixture of the Cantonese and Mandarin variants of the saying.\nBack in the 1960s, children in Hong Kong used to say \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff0c\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86\uff0c\u6597\u96f6\u5514\u611b (Cantonese, Gung Hei Fat Choy, Lai Si Tau Loi, Tau Ling M Ngoi), which was recorded in the pop song Kowloon Hong Kong by Reynettes in 1966. Later in the 1970s, children in Hong Kong used the saying: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff0c\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86\uff0c\u4f0d\u6beb\u5acc\u5c11\uff0c\u58f9\u868a\u5514\u611b, roughly translated as, \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope, fifty cents is too little, don't want a dollar either.\" It basically meant that they disliked small change \u2013 coins which were called \"hard substance\" (Cantonese: \u786c\u5622). Instead, they wanted \"soft substance\" (Cantonese: \u8edf\u5622), which was either a ten dollar or a twenty dollar note.\n^\"The Lunar New Year: Rituals and Legends\". Asia for Educators, Columbia University. On New Year's Day and for the next several days, people still follow the custom of exchanging visits \u2014 with close relatives first, then with distant relatives and friends. Traditionally, the order of these visits also began with the eldest, and the first day was usually devoted to paternal family relatives.\n^\"Love of Chinese Language Expressed in Couplets\". The earliest known couplet was written at Spring Festival 964 by the King of Later Shu. It said: \"The New Year is bathed in forefathers' blessings; the joyous festival promises everlasting youth and wealth.\"\n^Magida, Lenore (18 December 1994). \"What's Doing in Hong Kong\". The New York Times. Retrieved 5 February 2019. In such an environment, it seems fitting that the traditional New Year's greeting is, in Cantonese, 'Kung Hei Fat Choy' \u2013 which means 'Wishing You Success and Prosperity.'",

        "context": "\nThe International Collegiate Programming Contest, known as the ICPC, is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world.[1] Directed by ICPC Executive Director and Baylor Professor Dr. William B. Poucher, the ICPC operates autonomous regional contests covering six continents culminating in a global World Finals every year. In 2018, ICPC participation included 52,709 students from 3,233 universities in 110 countries.\nThe ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation and operates under agreements with host universities and non-profits, all in accordance with the ICPC Policies and Procedures.[2] From 1977 until 2017 ICPC was held under the auspices of ACM and was referred to as ACM-ICPC.[3]\nThe ICPC, the \u201cInternational Collegiate Programming Contest\u201d, is an extra-curricular, competitive programming sport for students at universities around the world. ICPC competitions provide gifted students opportunities to interact, demonstrate, and improve their teamwork, programming, and problem-solving process. The ICPC is a global platform for academia, industry, and community to shine the spotlight on and raise the aspirations of the next generation of computing professionals as they pursue excellence.[4] In its own words, ICPC is:\nan algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world\nThe ICPC traces its roots to a competition held at Texas A&M University in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon Computer Science Honor Society (UPE). This initial programming competition was titled First Annual Texas Collegiate Programming Championship and each University was represented by a team of up to five members. The computer used was a 360 model 65 which was one of the first machines with a DAT (Dynamic Address Translator aka \"paging\") system for accessing memory. The start of the competition was delayed for about 90 minutes because two of the four \"memory bank\" amplifiers were down. Teams that participated included, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, University of Houston, and five or six other Texas University / Colleges. There were three problems that had to be completed and the cumulative time from \"start\" to \"successful completion\" determined first-, second-, and third-place winners. The programming language used was Fortran. The programs were written on coding sheets, keypunched on Hollerith cards, and submitted for execution. The University of Houston team won the competition completing all three problems successfully with time. The second- and third-place teams did not successfully complete all three problems. The contest evolved into its present form as a multi-tier competition in 1977, with the first finals held in conjunction with the ACM Computer Science Conference.\nFrom 1977 to 1989, the contest included mainly teams of four from universities throughout the United States and Canada. ICPC Headquarters was hosted by Baylor University from 1989 until 2022, with regional contests established within the world's university community, the ICPC has grown into a worldwide competition. To increase access to the World Finals, teams were reduced to three students within their first five academic years.[citation needed]\nFrom 1997 to 2017, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was the sponsor of ICPC. During that time contest participation has grown by more than 2000%. In 1997, 840 teams from 560 universities participated. In 2017, 46,381 students from 2,948 universities in 103 countries on six continents participated in regional competitions. Organized as a highly localized extra-curricular university mind sport and operating as a globally-coordinated unincorporated association operating under agreements with host universities and non-profits, the ICPC is open to qualified teams from every university in the world.[citation needed]\nUPE has provided continuous support since 1970 and honored World Finalists since the first Finals in 1976. The ICPC is indebted to ACM member contributions and ACM assistance from 1976 to 2018. Baylor University served since 1985, hosting ICPC Headquarters from 1989 until 2022. The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation which provides the ICPC Global Headquarters to service a globally-coordinated community whose events operate under agreements with host universities and non-profits to insure that participation in ICPC is open to qualified teams from every university in the world. See ICPC Policies and Procedures.[2]\nThe ICPC World Finals (The Annual World Finals of the International Collegiate Programming Contest) is the final round of competition. Over its history it has become a 4-day event held in the finest venues worldwide with 140 teams competing in the 2018 World Finals. Recent World Champion teams have been recognized by their country's head of state. In recent years, media impressions have hovered at the one billion mark.[citation needed]\nSince 2000, only teams from Russia, China, and Poland have won the ICPC world finals, except in 2022.[6] Participation in North America is much smaller than in the rest of the world, which is partially attributed to the perceived low payoff of participating.[7]\nICPC contests are team competitions. Current rules stipulate that each team consist of three students. Participants must be university students, who have had less than five years of university education before the contest. Students who have previously competed in two World Finals or five regional competitions are ineligible to compete again.[8][9]\nDuring each contest, the teams of three are given 5 hours to solve between eight and fifteen programming problems (with eight typical for regionals and twelve for finals). They must submit solutions as programs in C, C++, Java, Ada,[10]Python[11][12] or Kotlin[13] (although it is not guaranteed every problem is solvable in any certain language, the ICPC website states that \"the judges will have solved all problems in Java and C++\" for both regional and world finals competitions). Programs are then run on test data. If a program fails to give a correct answer, the team is notified and can submit another program.\nThe winner is the team which correctly solves the most problems. If necessary to rank teams for medals or prizes among tying teams, the placement of teams is determined by the sum of the elapsed times at each point that they submitted correct solutions plus 20 minutes for each rejected submission of a problem ultimately solved. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.[14]\nCompared to other programming contests (for example, International Olympiad in Informatics), the ICPC is characterized by a large number of problems (eight or more problems in just 5 hours). Another feature is that each team can use only one computer, although teams have three students. This makes the time pressure even greater. Good teamwork and ability to withstand pressure is needed to win.\nThe 2004 ACM-ICPC World Finals were hosted at the Obecni Dum, Prague, by Czech Technical University in Prague. 3,150 teams representing 1,411 universities from 75 countries competed in elimination rounds, with 73 of those teams proceeding to the world finals.

        "context": "\nThe World Population in 2023 is 8,045,311,447 (at mid-year, according to U.N. estimates[1]), a 0.88% increase (70,206,291 people) from 2022, when the population was 7,975,105,156, a 0.83% increase (65,810,005 people) from 2021, when the world population was 7,909,295,151.\n(move and expand the bar at the bottom of the chart to navigate through time)\nAt the dawn of agriculture, about 8000 B.C., the population of the world was approximately 5 million. Over the 8,000-year period up to 1 A.D. it grew to 200 million (some estimate 300 million or even 600, suggesting how imprecise population estimates of early historical periods can be), with a growth rate of under 0.05% per year.\nA tremendous change occurred with the industrial revolution: whereas it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for world population to reach one billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years (1930), the third billion in 30 years (1960), the fourth billion in 15 years (1974), and the fifth billion in only 13 years (1987).\nDuring the 20th century alone, the population in the world has grown from 1.65 billion to 6 billion.\nIn 1970, there were roughly half as many people in the world as there are now.\nBecause of declining growth rates, it will now take over 200 years to double again.\nPopulation in the world is growing at a rate of around 0.88% per year in 2023 (down from 0.98% in 2020, and 1.06% in 2019). The current population increase is estimated at around 70 million people per year.\nAnnual growth rate reached its peak in the late 1960s, when it was at around 2%. The rate of increase has nearly halved since then, and will continue to decline in the coming years.\nWorld population will therefore continue to grow in the 21st century, but at a much slower rate compared to the recent past. World population has doubled (100% increase) in 40 years from 1959 (3 billion) to 1999 (6 billion). It is now estimated that it will increase by 50% in the subsequent 40 years, to reach 9 billion by 2037.\nThe latest world population projections indicate that world population will reach 10 billion persons in the year 2057 and 10.4 billion in 2100.\nThe United Nations projects world population will reach 10 billion in the year 2058.\nWorld population is expected to reach 9 billion in the year 2037.\nThe current world population is 8,072,582,813 as of Tuesday, November 14, 2023 according to the most recent United Nations estimates [1] elaborated by Worldometer. The term \"World Population\" refers to the human population (the total number of humans currently living) of the world.\nWorld population has reached 8 billion peopleon November 15, 2022 according to the United Nations. The U.S. Census Bureau International Database (IDB) estimates instead that the world population hit 8 billion on September 26, 2023. In their note, they added: \"Emphasis on the word estimates. There are many sources of uncertainty in estimating the global population, and it\u2019s unlikely this population milestone was reached on that exact date\" [source]\nAccording to the latest revision by the United Nations (released in 2022), world population reached 7 Billion in late 2010 (after being previously estimated as occurring on October 31, 2011). The U.S. Census Bureau made a different estimate, for which the 7 billion mark was reached on March 12, 2012.\nAccording to the latest revision by the United Nations (released in 2022), the 6 billion figure was reached towards the end of 1998 (this was previously estimated as occurring on October 12, 1999, celebrated as the Day of 6 Billion). According to the U.S. Census Bureau instead, the six billion milestone was reached on July 22, 1999, at about 3:49 AM GMT. Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the date and time of when 6 billion was reached will probably change because the already uncertain estimates are constantly being updated.\nAccording to a recent study (based on the 2010 world population of 6.9 billion) by The Pew Forum, there are:\n2,173,180,000 Christians (31% of world population), of which 50% are Catholic, 37% Protestant, 12% Orthodox, and 1% other.\n1,598,510,000 Muslims (23%), of which 87-90% are Sunnis, 10-13% Shia.\n1,126,500,000 No Religion affiliation (16%): atheists, agnostics and people who\ndo not identify with any particular religion. One-in-five people (20%) in the United States are religiously unaffiliated.\n1,033,080,000 Hindus (15%), the overwhelming majority (94%) of which live in India.\n487,540,000 Buddhists (7%), of which half live in China.\n405,120,000 Folk Religionists (6%): faiths that are closely associated with a particular\ngroup of people, ethnicity or tribe.\nIt was written during the 1970s that 75% of the people who had ever been born were alive at that moment. This was false.\nAssuming that we start counting from about 50,000 B.C., the time when modern Homo sapiens appeared on the earth (and not from 700,000 B.C. when the ancestors of Homo sapiens appeared, or several million years ago when hominids were present), taking into account that all population data are a rough estimate, and assuming a constant growth rate applied to each period up to modern times, it has been estimated that a total of approximately 106 billion people have been born since the dawn of the human species, making the population currently alive roughly 6% of all people who have ever lived on planet Earth.\nOthers have estimated the number of human beings who have ever lived to be anywhere from 45 billion to 125 billion, with most estimates falling into the range of 90 to 110 billion humans.\nThe world population counter displayed on Worldometer takes into consideration data from two major sources: the United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau.\nThe United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs every two years calculates, updates, and publishes estimates of total population in its World Population Prospects series. These population estimates and projections provide the standard and consistent set of population figures that are used throughout the United Nations system.\nThe World Population Prospect: the 2022 Revision provides the most recent data available (released in July of 2022). Estimates and projected world population and country specific populations are given from 1950 through 2100 and are released every two years. Worldometer, as it is common practice, utilizes the medium fertility estimates.\nData underlying the population estimates are national and sub national census data and data on births, deaths, and migrants available from national sources and publications, as well as from questionnaires. For all countries, census and registration data are evaluated and, if necessary, adjusted for incompleteness by the Population Division as part of its preparations of the official United Nations population estimates and projections.\nThe International Programs Center at the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division also develops estimates and projections based on analysis of available data (based on census, survey, and administrative information) on population, fertility, mortality, and migration for each country or area of the world. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, world population reached 7 billion on March 12, 2012.\nFor most countries adjustment of the data is necessary to correct for errors, omissions, and inconsistencies in the data. Finally, since most recent data for a single country is often two years old on average, the current world population figure is necessarily a projection of past data based on assumed trends. As new data become available, assumptions and data are reevaluated and past conclusions and current figures may be modified.\nThe above world population clock is based on the latest estimates released in July of 2022 by the United Nations. It will show the same number wherever you are in the world and whatever time you set on your PC.\nVisitors around the world visiting a PC clock based counter, instead, will see different numbers depending on where they are located. This is the case with other world population clocks - such as the one hosted on a United Nations website, reaching 8 billion in 24 different instances (one per hour) on November 15, 2022, when each local time zone reached 12:10:08. Similarly, in 2011, the clocks on a UN website and on National Geographic - showed 7 billion whenever the visitor's locally set PC clocks reached 4:21:10 AM on October 31, 2011.\nObviously, the UN data is based on estimates and can't be 100% accurate, so in all honesty nobody can possibly say with any degree of certainty on which day world population reached 7 billion (or any other exact number), let alone at what time. But once an estimate is made (based on the best data and analysis available), the world population clock should be showing the same number at any given time anywhere around the world.",
