{"id": 72971434, "context": "L. Q. Ivy was a seventeen-year-old African-American male who was accused of raping a White woman in 1925 in Rocky Ford, Mississippi. He was tortured and burned to death in 1925 by a lynch mob of White people.\nAccusation and search for attacker.\nIn September 1925, Bessie Gaines, a 21-year-old White single mother, was raped and severely beaten in Rocky Ford (now known as Etta, Mississippi). A neighbor drove her to the nearest hospital in New Albany, where Union County sheriff John Roberts interviewed her and her family. The sheriff assembled a posse of White men, who used bloodhounds to search for her attacker. The dogs led them to a group of Black timber-cutters, including Cleveland Jones, Sherill Kilpatrick, Spencer Ivy, and L. Q. Ivy.\nAccording to University of Mississippi Professor and journalist LaReeca Rucker, people interviewed \"...said Rush Scott, one of the members of the posse that the sheriff deputized to search for Gaines' assailant, told police that from the time the black suspects were dropped off at the logging field, and the time Gaines said the rape occurred, it would have been impossible for anyone to travel on foot the two and a half miles to the cornfield where she was attacked. He also reportedly remarked that he saw the white driver of a gas truck from New Albany, moving across the cornfield.\"\nArrest, mob gathering.\nFor unknown reasons, the sheriff settled on L. Q. Ivy as the likely culprit, and he was arrested, transported to the hospital in New Albany, and presented to Gaines. She was unable to definitively identify Ivy as her attacker. There are conflicting accounts whether L. Q. Ivy confessed to Sheriff Roberts. Sheriff Roberts did not hold Ivy in the New Albany jail, but secretly moved him to Aberdeen, because authorities \"predicted a riot might occur.\"\nMayor J.E. Tate, Judge Thomas Pegram, and the sheriff urged calm, and sheriff's deputies confiscated a large number of weapons. New Albany native and U.S. Senator Hubert Stephens attempted to get the mob to disperse. The crowd dispersed after it was revealed that the Sheriff had secreted Ivy \"down the river\".\nFailed identification.\nThat night, a group of men led by Billy Preston entered the home of Judge Pegram, and coerced him into writing a writ to produce Ivy at the hospital on Monday. Sheriff Roberts attempted to defeat the mob by bringing Ivy to the hospital on Sunday morning instead, where he was presented to Bessie Gaines for identification. Gaines could not definitively identify Ivy as the perpetrator, but stated \"I'm not sure but he looks like the man.\" Upon leaving, Preston and the mob accosted the sheriff outside the hospital. The victim's father, Bob Gaines, distracted the crowd by shouting that Bessie was not sure, and asked the crowd not to take hasty action. Roberts, along with the sheriff from Aberdeen, took advantage of the distraction to attempt to hustle Ivy away from the scene.\nVigilante torture.\nInstead, Union County Sheriff John Roberts took custody of Ivy and attempted to drive him to Holly Springs, leaving behind two deputies to block the mob from following. Under armed threats from the mob, the deputies allowed them to pass, then the sheriff faced a roadblock from the vigilantes. At this point, the sheriff relinquished Ivy into the hands of the mob, just outside the city limits of Myrtle. The mob took him to a location in Rocky Ford, where they tortured him with knives and with fire, dangling him from a rafter. While Ivy continued to maintain his innocence through torture, a larger mob, estimated at 400 gathered. \nThis mob built a pyre. The mob stripped Ivy, drove a Model T axle into the ground and chained him to it. He was tortured with a blowtorch and lemon squeezers, which were used to squash his testicles into a bloody pulp. They piled crates soaked with kerosene around him. When it was apparent that he would be burned, some sources state that Ivy confessed. According to one source, \"Ivy confessed that he was the lone assailant, probably because he wanted to spare the three other African American men who were being held in connection with the attack.\" After considerable torture, three men stepped forward and set fire to the crates. Ivy died and the stench became objectionable, and more wood was added to the fire to completely consume the body.\nWitness account.\nJ.L. Roulhac, a reporter for the \"Memphis Press-Scimitar\" witnessed the attack on Ivy first hand, and along with three pictures taken of the murder, published this account: \"I watched a negro burned at the stake at Rocky Ford, Mississippi Sunday afternoon. I watched an angry mob chain him to an iron stake. I watched them pile wood around his helpless body. I watched them pour gasoline on this wood. And I watched three men set this wood on fire. I stood in a crowd of 600 people as the flames gradually crept nearer and nearer to the helpless negro. I watched the blaze climb higher and higher, encircling him without mercy. I heard his cry of agony as the flames reached him and set his clothing on fire. \"Oh God; Oh, God!\" he shouted. \"I didn't do it. Have mercy!\" The blaze leaped higher. The negro struggled. He kicked the chain loose from his ankles, but it held his waist and neck against the iron post that was becoming red with the intense heat. \"Have mercy, I didn't do it, I didn't do it.\" he shouted again. \"You should have thought of this before.\" someone shouted from the crowd. There was an instant of silence. Then several voices rose in agreement. Nowhere was there a sign of mercy among the members of the mob, nor did they seem to regret the horrible thing they had done. The negro had supposedly sinned against their race and died a death of torture.\"\nAftermath.\nAfter Ivy was completely burned on the pyre, the mob left, and many complained that they would have to go to New Albany to eat, since the crowd had eaten all the food locally. Sheriff Roberts stated he expected no further violence, and claimed that he did not recognize any members of the mob. The mob was so confident that they would not face any repercussions for their actions, they made no attempt to conceal their identities, and even posed for pictures.\nGovernor Henry L. Whitfield denounced the lynching of L. Q. Ivy in a signed statement: \"The time has come when the law-abiding citizens of Mississippi should assert themselves in no uncertain terms against such mob action and should rally to the support of the peace officers in maintaining the integrity of the law.\" A book published by James Nathaniel Flowers, President of the Mississippi State Bar Association, said, \"State officials, officers and outstanding members of the State Bar Association, and other prominent Mississippians condemn mob violence and call on officers to do their sworn duty.\" Flowers commented on the lynching of L. Q. Ivy: \"The fifth lynching further to blacken the record of this State this year occurred in Union County on Sunday, September 20th, when a mob took the alleged negro rapist from two sheriffs near the Myrtle bridge and burned him at the stake.\" The book was widely distributed, and went into second printing in 1926.", "__index_level_0__": 6883, "length": 1210, "pred": {"ppl": 7.3858823776, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -0.9869908099, "ppl/zlib": 0.0006313768, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.5696272002, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.3878361278, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.9384877602, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.9814982344, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.2673393294, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.6989218946, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.2277073844}, "question": "What was the fate of L.

After graduating, he worked for Glenn Howells Architects on Birmingham residential projects then moved to London to work at Grimshaw Architects, first on the rebuild of London's Euston station to receive the HS2 high-speed railway line, then on the North London Heat and Power project in Edmonton. While at Grimshaw, he founded a multi-ethnic group and allies network.\nHe is currently employed by construction consultancy Mace Group. He is also an ambassador for the Mayor of London's Design Future London challenge.\nRIBA president.\nOki's 2022 campaign to become RIBA president was supported by a Just Transition Lobby movement backed by the Future Architects Front (FAF), the Section of Architectural Workers (SAW), and the institute's Future Architects Steering Group.\nThe RIBA had been accused of institutional racism, of having a \"deep, systemic disengagement from the membership\", and of lacking transparency. In March 2022, young architects began a campaign to get the next RIBA president to move beyond \"empty slogans and self-serving initiatives\" and shake up an institute seen as \"out of touch\" with the wider profession. The campaign included members of FAF, and Oki was named as their preferred candidate on 6 May 2022, declaring \"There needs to be a mind-shift in the architecture profession.

Upon taking office, Oki said he intended to continue to press for more diversity and inclusivity within architecture, saying \"a diversity of people\" are needed \"to solve the big issues of the day\", and committed to pressing the UK government to deliver a national retrofit strategy, pledging \"to be a steadfast advocate for decarbonising the built environment.\" He also urged architects to help deliver better UK social housing.", "__index_level_0__": 14985, "length": 486, "pred": {"ppl": 6.262450695, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0732938143, "ppl/zlib": 0.0011670303, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.2774477243, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.0499940395, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.6676985729, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.7272511488, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.0238050037, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.4548757135, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.9949675136}, "question": "Who became the first black president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in September 2023?", "answer": "Muyiwa Oki", "prediction": "Question: Who became the first black president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in September 2023?\nAnswer: Muyiwa Oki", "generated_answer": "Sheila Remy-Martin\n\nQ:"}

He was born in 1794, to the Reverend William Buckle (1759\u20131830) and his wife Anne (n\u00e9e Smith; died 1800) of Wrentham in Suffolk. Barlee's father William and uncle Charles changed the Buckle family name to Barlee in 1811 by Royal Sign Manual to benefit from a family inheritance, which included retrospectively applying the name change to their children.\nBarlee's siblings who survived to adulthood were his older sister Anne (born 1791) who later married the Reverend Frederick Beatty of Dublin, and a younger brother, Thomas Dalling (born 1796), a Royal Navy Midshipman who was wounded in action on the HMS \"Amelia\" on 7 February 1813, and later published a volume of poetry. Barlee's stepmother was Lucy Elizabeth Davy.\nBarlee began his career as an attorney in the town of Yoxford, Suffolk, but sold off his law residence in 1835.\nOn 23 September 1821 Barlee married Charlotte Leman, daughter of Reverend Naunton Thomas Ogill Leman of Brampton. They had one son, Naunton Dalling Barlee (13 June 1829 \u2013 7 November 1838), who died aged nine after a protracted illness.\nAfter the death of his son Barlee was disconsolate and in poor health. One day while walking on Paignton beach after a storm he noticed a mother and daughter collecting shells and asked if he could assist them, finding some solace in the activity. He befriended the women and later visited their house and shell collection. After this Barlee dedicated himself to the study of natural history, especially conchology. John Gwyn Jeffreys often accompanied Barlee on dredging expeditions. Barlee was sometimes struck with attacks of illness while out dredging, but he carried on working around them.\nWhile Barlee seldom published upon his own discoveries, he shared his specimens with friends and colleagues, and so made notable contributions to the works of other naturalists.

{"id": 72284879, "context": "Leipzig's Old Town Hall \u2013 which dominates the east side of the marketplace in Leipzig's district Mitte - is considered one of Germany's most important secular Renaissance buildings. At the rear is the Naschmarkt (Sweet market). The mayor and the municipal administration have been housed in the new town hall since 1905.\nDescription.\nThe Old Town Hall is a landmark of Leipzig and is generally considered to be an extremely beautiful building. The impression of beauty comes from length, colour, uniformity and proportions. With two storeys and a length of more than 300 feet, the building would be long but not high, if there would not be the steep roof. The eaves edge is low, so the roof contributes significantly to the height. As far as its effect is concerned, it is receded into the background by the row of wall dormers (6 on the Marktplatz side, 7 on the Naschmarkt side) with their connecting horizontal lines. Compared to the length, the width of the house is also relatively small. The high staggered gables on the narrow sides are emphasized by strong horizontal cornices which is typical for that time in Saxony. The stone arcade on the market side, built between 1906 and 1909 and continuing on the narrow sides, represents another strong horizontal element. The elongated structure is interrupted by the octagonal stair tower, which stands on the market side next to the main portal, through which a passage from the market to the Naschmarkt is possible. Only two colors are used in total: the warm color tone of the Rochlitz porphyry and a matching beige or ocher tone for the wall plaster. The main portal is supported by two Ionic columns and flanked with so-called gaff heads (in German: \"Gaffkopf\"), which are supposed to represent the master builders. At second glance one discovers numerous other details such as the stone box oriels on the two gable ends, designed keystones , ornamental fountains, all kinds of commemorative plaques and finally a mullion on the south side. This is dated to 1230 and comes from a previous building, probably a tower house.\nFor all its symmetry, it is worth noting that the building has surprising asymmetrical elements, see below. According to Wolfgang Hocqu\u00e9l, such asymmetries are a hallmark of the German Renaissance. The Old Town Hall is essentially a Renaissance building that dates back to 1556. Some additions were made during the Baroque period and then again from 1906 to 1909. Parts of previous buildings were also reused.\nHistory.\nAntecedant buildings.\nIn 1341, Frederick II, Margrave of Meissen, offered the Leipzig mercers a representative building south of the market, probably built in the Romanesque style at the end of the thirteenth century. This building corresponded approximately, in its location and size, to the current council chamber (Ratsstube) of the old town hall. Presumably, the city council was already exercising its functions here. The Leipzig Town Hall is mentioned for the first time in a document from 1360. Due to the growth of Leipzig and the consequent increase in the tasks of the city council, extensions were carried out on the north side of the Tuchhaus (Cloth hall). The two new buildings, which initially extended to the current passage, were erected on the foundations of the previous buildings, which also explains the \"bend\" of about three degrees in the longitudinal fa\u00e7ade of the town hall between the first and the second wall dormer from the right.\nIn the middle of the fifteenth century, it was connected to two other buildings north of the current passage. In December 1467, a new council chamber was completed. The construction of a stair tower above the passage and therefore the final fusion of the different buildings cannot be traced precisely. A stair tower is mentioned for the first time in 1476. The mercers moved into their own building in 1482. A year later, a secret room was created, which is a kind of mezzanine and can be visited today as the Aerar (treasure). In 1498, trade was flourishing at the time, it was decided to rebuild the town hall, but this became financially impossible.\nConstruction of the old town hall in 1556/57.\nUntil the middle of the sixteenth century, there were fundamental structural changes, for example the town hall was widened by about four meters (13 feet) in the direction of the Naschmarkt, accompanied by an enlargement and elevation of the roof. The town hall was rebuilt in 1556/57 by the reigning mayor and major merchant Hieronymus Lotter and thus largely acquired its current exterior appearance in the Saxon Renaissance style. The first site manager was Paul Speck, to whom the design can probably attributed. He was followed by the master Paul Widemann after his death in early 1557. The town's master mason, Sittich Pfretzschner, was also involved.\nIn addition to being the seat of the councillors, the old town hall also houses the Upper Court of Leipzig and the Court of Aldermen, the magistrate of the city, the archives of the council and prison cells housed in the cellar from the end of the sixteenth century. The ceremonial hall, with a length of about 40\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft.) was for a long time the largest event venue of the city and was therefore also used for public receptions and festivities.\nHans Krell's paintings of Saxon princes, which have been in the ceremonial hall and the council chamber since 1553, were continually being completed.\nPosterior alterations and additions.\nFrom the eighteenth century, there was talk of increasing the height of the building. Finally, only the tower was raised by 2.80\u00a0m (9.2\u00a0ft.) by the master builder Christian D\u00f6ring in baroque style. At the end of the nineteenth century, the town hall finally proved too small for the booming city. Decades of discussions followed about demolishing of the building and rebuilding it on the same site, or even selling the land for the construction of commercial buildings. The new town hall was finally built from 1899 on the place of the Pleissenburg. The preservation of the old town hall was decided in 1905 with a tie by the vote of the president of the city council, Johannes Junck. After extensive renovations, it is to serve as the Leipzig City History Museum.\nRestoration and reconstruction work for the new use of a museum took place from 1906 until 1909 under the direction of Otto Wilhelm Scharenberg, the current exterior is largely a remodeling of these conversions. At the same time, a porphyry arcade by Rochlitz was created on the ground floor, on the side of the marketplace, instead of wooden sales arbors. Since then, there are two fountains \u201eBadender Knabe\u201c and \u201eBadendes M\u00e4dchen\u201c in a niche inside and in front of the passage on the side of the Naschmarkt.\nDuring World War II, the building was badly damaged during the air raid on Leipzig on 4 December 1943, and the roof structure burnt to the ground. The concrete ceiling supported by iron, which was installed during renovation work in the early twentieth century, prevented flames from spreading from the roof structure to the historic rooms on the first floor. Most of the museum's contents have already been moved before and were preserved. The reconstruction took place from 1946 until 1950 and was one of the first of a public building in Leipzig. After small exhibitions from 1945, the city's history museum and thus the old town hall reopened in 1952.\nFrom 1988 until 1990, the building was closed due to extensive renovation. From the beginning of 2017 until 2018, the fa\u00e7ade including the dials of the two clocks was extensively renovated.\nInside the building, one should especially see the large ceremonial hall, the council chamber, the landscape room in the late baroque style, the treasury and the only authentic portrait of Johann Sebastian Bach by Elias Gottlob Haussmann), who signed his certificate of employment as cantor at St. Thomas in the council chamber in 1723. To point out is also the scale model of the city of Leipzig of 1823, made by Johann Christoph Merzdorf.\nThe old town hall and the golden ratio.\nWhat is remarkable is the asymmetrical structure of the building from the front and back, roughly dividing it into golden ratio. During the transformations carried out by Hieronymus Lotter in 1556/57, the existing buildings and their foundations gave the fa\u00e7ade its current dimensions. It is often assumed that the tower of the old town hall, which is shifted laterally to the left, marks the proportions of the golden ratio of the building. However, the actuell division of the building front towards the marketplace in terms of golden ration is constituted by the center of the main portal and passage - located asymmetrically with respect to the tower. The overall aesthetic impression of the building is not affected by this fact related to the height of the tower.\nCircumferential inscription.\nThis text half in Latin and half in German language can be read all around the town hall below the top floor:\n\"NACH CHRISTI UNSERES HERRN GEBURTH IM MDLVI IAHR BEY REGIERUNG DES DURCHLAUCHTIGSTEN UND HOCHGEBORENEN FURSTEN UND HERRN AUGUSTI HERTZOGEN ZU SACHSEN DES H.

It is one of the few surviving industrial buildings on Nicollet Island, and its former building is now the Nicollet Island Paviliion.\nHistory.\nDevelopment of Nicollet Island.\nWilliam Bros Boiler Works was founded in 1893 on Nicollet Island in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \nNicollet Island was first developed in the 1860s by William W. Eastman, a lumberman, and John Merriam, a St. Paul-based broker, who had initially proposed the area as a park (which was ultimately struck down). The pair designed the layout of the island with residential buildings on the north side of the island and industrial buildings to the south. In 1879, the Island Power Building was constructed on Merriam Street to power those industrial operations. In 1887, the Lintges, Conwell Company, another boiler manufacturer, set up shop on the island. They were based in a one-story wood-frame building.\nNicollet Island-Northeast Fire.\nIn 1893, most of these structures were destroyed in the Nicollet Island-Northeast Fire. On the afternoon August 13, 1893, a blaze burned buildings on the island including Lenhart Wagon Works, Cedar Lake Ice House and stable, the Clark Box Factory, and the Minneapolis Brewing Company. The fire also eventually spread to Boom Island.\nConstruction of William Bros Boiler Works.\nThe William Bros Boiler Works opened soon after the fire, building on the former Lintges, Conwell Company site. The initial building was a one-story brick building with a steel-truss gable roof. In the early 1900s, the company expanded to a new plant that was located on the corner of east Hennepin Avenue and Johnson Street. The Nicollet Island boiler factory eventually become part of the Durkee-Atwood complex, a rubber manufacturer, in 1923. \nConversion to parks property.\nWhile conversations about the land on Nicollet Island becoming a park had begun when the land was developed in the 1860s, they did not come to fruition until nearly 100 years later. The first park on Nicollet Island was at its southernmost tip and had been designated in 1944 as Bicentennial Park.\nIn 1971, the National Park Service included the land around the nearby St. Anthony Falls on its list of National Historic Districts, and a 1972 report by city manager Tommy Thompson proposed redevelopment of the former industrial and railroad land on the island. In 1976, the Minneapolis Parks Board began plans to acquire the Nicollet Island property to create a new park, and purchased the former Boiler Works Building in 1981 (then being used by the Durkee-Atwood company). At $6.1 million for the sale, this was the parks board's most expensive land purchase to date.\nAt the point of becoming a park, only the Boiler Works building and the Island Sash and Door Company building remained of the former industrial locations. The latter has since become the Nicollet Island Inn, and the former Boiler Works building is now the Nicollet Island Pavillion. The pavillion was enclosed in 2003 for year-round use.\nThe William Bros Boiler Works' east Hennepin plant location is now an office park off of the I-35W highway.", "__index_level_0__": 11648, "length": 507, "pred": {"ppl": 6.723074913, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.004679398, "ppl/zlib": 0.0013828343, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.8821522117, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.5602548659, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.9205861077, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.8992941311, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.15172677, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.5722551526, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.093991966}, "question": "What is the current use of the former William Bros Boiler Works building on Nicollet Island?", "answer": "Nicollet Island Pavillion", "prediction": "Question: What is the current use of the former William Bros Boiler Works building on Nicollet Island?\nAnswer: Nicollet Island Pavillion", "generated_answer": "housing\n\nQ: What is the name of"}

{"id": 73216376, "context": "The Standard Catalogue of British Coins, also known as \"Coins of England and the United Kingdom\" and after its founder as the \"Seaby Catalogue\" or \"S.\" for short, is an English-language coin catalog published annually. \nScope and relevance.\nThe catalogue covers all coins that have circulated in the British Isles, from the earliest times when coins were introduced from northern Gaul around 150 BC to the most recent new issues of the Royal Mint. It is considered the industry-standard reference book for British coins and an essential guide for beginners, serious numismatists and anyone interested in British Coinage. Its catalogue numbers are applied internationally and are quoted by auction houses and dealers.\nHistory.\n\"Coins of England and the United Kingdom\" was first published in 1929 by the London coin dealer B.A. Seaby Ltd. as a brochure under the title \"Catalogue of Coins of Great Britain and Ireland\", then biennially until the outbreak of war in 1939. On this basis Herbert A. Seaby (1898\u20131979) wrote the \"Standard Catalogue of the Coins of Great Britain and Ireland\", during the war, which was again published biennially from 1945 onwards and illustrated with line drawings of the coins.\nEdited by Peter Seaby, the \"Standard Catalogue of British Coins\" was published from 1962 onwards in two parts, \"I. England and United Kingdom\" and \"II. Coins of Scotland, Ireland and the Islands\", in annual editions and with black and white photos of the coins.\nAfter a one-year break, Volume I (16th edition) was published from 1978 and Volume II in 1979 in an enlarged format, edited by Peter Seaby and P. Frank Purvey, until the company Spink &amp; Son took over the entire publishing division of B.A. Seaby Ltd. and published the Standard Catalogue in its own name from the 33rd edition in 1997. With the 42nd edition, it was converted to colour printing in 2007, and every coin in the catalogue was re-photographed for this purpose.\nIn 2021, Volume I was split into \"Coins of England &amp; the United Kingdom, Pre-Decimal Issues\", and \"Coins of England &amp; the United Kingdom, Decimal Issues\", both edited by Emma Howard. It remains the only catalogue to feature every major coin type from Celtic to the Decimal coinage of Queen Elizabeth II, arranged in chronological order and divided into metals under each reign, then into coinages, denominations and varieties (57th Edition, 2022).", "__index_level_0__": 7970, "length": 387, "pred": {"ppl": 5.9693546295, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -0.967463944, "ppl/zlib": 0.0015699814, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.2772062978, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.9624059585, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.3532055244, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.4652300952, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.8401978951, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.3298741926, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.9048937421}, "question": "What is the title of the catalogue considered the industry-standard reference book for British coins?", "answer": "\"Coins of England and the United Kingdom\" or \"Standard Catalogue of British Coins\"", "prediction": "Question: What is the title of the catalogue considered the industry-standard reference book for British coins?\nAnswer: \"Coins of England and the United Kingdom\" or \"Standard Catalogue of British Coins\"", "generated_answer": "Comprehensive Catalogue of British Coins "}

{"id": 74655551, "context": "The Battle of Faber's Put, also known as the Battle of Faber's Pass was a battle fought during the Second Boer War on the night of May 29\u201330, 1900.\nBackground.\nAs British forces began gaining ground in the Transvaal in the spring of 1900, columns of colonial and British forces were dispatched to the Cape Colony to pursue the Boer Commandos operating in that area.\nIn May, the British pushed towards the Boer capitals of Johannesburg and Pretoria and overwhelmed the garrisons there, capturing and occupying the capitals.\nGeneral Warren led a column composed of Canadian and British soldiers across the Northern Cape and halted for supplies at a place known as Faber's Put near Campbell. The British established a camp at Faber's Put, but it was situated on unfavorable ground, surrounded by high ridges which could allow marksmen to fire down into the camp from behind cover.\nBattle.\nLate on the night of May 29, a force of Boers under the command of General Villers bypassed British sentries and surrounded the encampment at Faber's Put. The Boers opened fire on a section of mounted infantry under the command of the Earl of Erroll which included Paget's Horse and the 23rd and 24th Companies of Imperial Yeomanry, scattering their horses and resulting in high casualties. The firefight woke the rest of the British camp and soon the Canadian Artillery tended to their 12-pounder guns. It was too dark for the guns to be aimed properly, and the Canadians had to hold their fire until daybreak.\nAs the sun began to rise, two companies of the Duke of Edinburgh's Own Rifles charged the Boers on the eastern side of the encampment, driving them back with assistance from a maxim machine gun section. \nAt this time, Sam Hughes rallied a mixed body of Yeomanry and Warren's Scouts, leading them in a spirited charge against the Boer positions.\nTwo teams of Canadians dragged their guns across the field under fire and brought them into action against the Boers on the high ground, losing 9 of 18 men in this action.\nAfter an hour, the combined fire from the artillery and the infantry charge finally broke the Boer attack, forcing them to retreat.\nAftermath.\nThe battle resulted in a British victory, but a costly one. In June, General Warren continued marching his column northwards, linking up with other forces near Kimberley.\nIn his official report for the battle, General Warren referred to the loss of Colonel Spence stating: \"I regret very much the loss of Colonel Spence, [he was] a most gallant and efficient commanding officer\". \nThe following soldiers were mentioned in dispatches by Warren for their actions during the battle: \nSam Hughes had fought bravely in the battle, leading the countercharge that pushed back and broke the Boer lines.

{"id": 71947475, "context": "Adhila Nasarin versus State Commissioner of Police (2022) is case where Kerala High Court held that the adults in mutually consenting relationship should be allowed to live their lives according to their informed choice, regardless of gender.\nBackground.\nAdhila Nassrin is reported to be involved in a relationship with Fathima Noora, a situation met with disapproval from both sets of parents. Adhila Nassrin argues that, after deciding to live together, they sought refuge at a Safe Home in Kozhikode with the support of the NGO Vanaja Collective, before informing their parents. Following parental assurances of resolution, the couple were taken to a relative's residence. However, subsequently, Fathima Noora was forcefully expelled from the house. Allegations also indicate that Adhila Nassrin's father, returning from abroad, assaulted Adhila Nassrin. In pursuit of protection, Adhila Nassrin took shelter in an Aluva Safe Home and has now filed this writ petition, asserted that her partner, Fathima Noora, has been unlawfully confined by Fathima Noora's parents.\nPolice Response and Awareness.\nAlthough the couple received some assistance from the Binanipuram Police in Kerala after their forced separation, the Thamarassery Police declined Adhila Nassrin's request to file a missing person's report for Fathima Noora. The Thamarassery police categorized Fathima Noora's abduction as a \"family matter\" beyond police involvement, revealing a lack of queer community awareness within law enforcement. Moreover, a report by \"The Wire\" suggested that the Thamarassery Police supported Fathima Noora's family in separating the couple. The Thamarassery police's indifference exacerbated the situation, prompting Adhila Nassrin to escalate the matter to the High Court, which might have been resolved at the local police level.The \"News18\" reported that the Binanipuram Police attempted to take the couple to the police station for a compromise with the parents, even after the High Court's order, which further affected the couple's mental well-being. \nThe current case underscores the necessity for heightened queer rights awareness and training among police personnel, including the incorporation of mandatory queer sensitivity training into police education. Additionally, the case underscores the need for stricter consequences for queerphobic behavior and deliberate disregard of queer community concerns by law enforcement.\nFamilial Violence and Abuse.\nAdhila Nassrin and Fathima Noora endured abusive treatment from their families, facing physical and psychological abuse before obtaining a High Court order in the current case. The couple reported that the psychological abuse persisted even after the court ruling.\nThe family constitutes the primary source of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse against queer individuals in India, perpetuating a normalization of such abuse within the queer community. Indian queer women encounter an endemic and deeply ingrained pattern of violence perpetrated by both intimate and extended family members, which includes instances of psychological and verbal abuse, physical harm, coerced marriages, unlawful confinement, medical mistreatment, and instances of corrective rape.\nThe current case underscores the necessity for more stringent laws against these abuses, frequently excused as 'family care and concern.' Additionally, it accentuates the importance of enhancing public understanding of the queer community and advocating for comprehensive sex education.\nImpact of Conversion Therapy.\nAmid their separation, Adhila Nasarin feared Fathima Noora might be subjected to 'conversion therapy' by her family. When reunited, Fathima Noora revealed that she had undergone counseling at a 'conversion therapy' center near Karippur airport, which was operated by a 'religious' counselor. Fathima Noora recounted being pressured by a mullah to conform to religious beliefs and engage in a heterosexual relationship, leading to mental and physical distress. After such traumatic experiences, Fathima Noora emphasized that a person could understandably succumb to family wishes after enduring such emotional turmoil.\nAlthough the National Medical Commission had deemed conversion therapy as 'professional misconduct' in response to a directive from the Madras High Court in the case of S Sushma v. Commissioner of Police, it's important to note that AYUSH practitioners, who practice alternative medicine systems like Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa, and Homeopathy, operate beyond the regulatory scope of the National Medical Commission. Notably, Fathima Noora underwent faith-based conversion therapy, a matter that remains unaddressed in India.\nThe current case underscores the necessity for legal action against practitioners of conversion therapy who claim to alter sexual orientations or gender identity through their methods in India.\nRole of Support Networks.\nThe Vanaja Collective, an non-governmental organization in Calicut, played a pivotal role in aiding the couple throughout their ordeal. It provided initial shelter and robust legal and moral backing in their fight for the fundamental human right to live as partners. In cases where the family, traditionally a source of support, becomes the abuser, alternative networks like the Vanaja collective play a crucial role in assisting queer individuals.\nWhile some state-driven initiatives, like shelter homes, training, and scholarships, target transgender individuals in Kerala, Adhila Nasarin and Fathima Noora's experience underscores the necessity for expanded governmental mechanisms providing comprehensive legal and social support for the entire queer spectrum. Apart from initiating new support programs, the state should enhance the implementation of existing government initiatives. Adequate state backing for non-governmental and community-based organizations should form part of these endeavors to safeguard the rights of the queer community.\nProceedings.\nA report from the Deputy Superintendent of Police of Aluva indicated that the officer attempted to communicate with Fathima Noora over the phone, and her mother informed the officer that Fathima Noora had gone with them of her own free will. Although the court was unconvinced by the claim made by Fathima Noora's mother and was considering initiating a suo moto writ petition, an advocate advocated for the filing of a Writ Petition (Criminal) on the same day regarding the detention of Fathima Noora.\nSubsequently, the court was informed that both Adhila Nassrin and Fathima Noora were present at the Binanipuram Police Station alongside their respective parents. As the Government stated that the parents were now amenable and that the couple could be produced within an hour, the court directed the appearance of both Adhila Nassrin and Fathima Noora in the court. The justices held private conversations with Fathima Noora in their chamber, during which Fathima Noora expressed her determination to continue the relationship. However, she categorically informed the justices that she had no complaints against her parents. Likewise, the justices also had private discussions with Adhila Nassrin, who also expressed her intention to continue the relationship.\nThe Circle Inspector of Police, Sunil V.R., from the Binanipuram Police Station, Ernakulam Rural, informed the court that the parents were now reconciled to the desires of their children. He presented consent letters issued by the respective parents.\nOpinion of the Court.\nFollowing the private conversations with Adhila Nassrin and Fathima Noora, the court held that Adhila Nassrin and Fathima Noora should be allowed to live their lives according to their informed choice. The court directed that the couple, in accordance with their desire, be returned to the Safe Home at present.\nThe verdict of the Bench noticeably lacks legal precedents, thorough analysis, and comprehensive reasoning to substantiate its conclusions.\nRelated Cases.\nHigh Court Cases.\nThis section delves into relevant cases from the High Courts of India. It's important to note that judgments rendered by one High Court do not hold mandatory authority over another, but they can still be regarded as influential precedents.\nSreeja S v. Commissioner of Police.\nIn the preceding case of \"Sreeja S v. Commissioner of Police (2018)\", Sreeja submitted a petition to the Kerala High Court seeking a writ of Habeas Corpus to compel the presentation of her same-sex romantic partner, Aruna, and ensure Aruna's liberty. While the court acted based on the petitioner's and alleged detainee's informed consent in both instances, differing from the Adhila Nasarin v. State Commissioner of Police case, the Bench in the Sreeja S v. Commissioner of Police case laid a robust legal groundwork by citing legal precedents and constitutional principles and rights. The Bench referenced Supreme Court precedents such as \"Soni Gerry v. Gerry Douglas (2018)\", which established that the court cannot curtail the personal freedom of an adult under the doctrine of parens patriae; \"Nandakumar v. State of Kerala (2018)\", which ruled that adults lacking legal capacity for marriage can cohabit without formal wedlock; and \"Shafin Jahan V. Asokan (2018)\", which underscored the court's role in habeas corpus petitions as ensuring the detainee's independent choice while refraining from assessing partner suitability.\nAdditionally, the Bench in the \"Sreeja S v. Commissioner of Police\" case relied on \"Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)\", which established that the Discrimination based on sexual orientation infringes on fundamental rights and asserted that constitutional morality should not be compromised for social morality. Furthermore, the Bench highlighted that the Indian Parliament recognizes 'live-in relationships' under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005. The Bench observed that the court should abstain from evaluating the suitability of the partner, asserting that not taking action could potentially jeopardize Constitutional rights; consequently, the court issued a writ of Habeas Corpus, granting Aruna the freedom to be with Sreeja.\nThe Supreme Court of India recognized \"Sreeja S v. Commissioner of Police (2018)\" as a significant ruling by a High Court in its \"Sensitisation Module for the Judiciary on LGBTIQA+ Community,\" which addresses the challenges that marginalized queer individuals face within the justice system due to systemic marginalization. The publication highlighted the observations of the High Court on aspects such as women's consent and adulthood, alongside the acknowledgment of 'live-in relationships' among same-sex couples, signifies progress in the acknowledgment of the rights of marginalized queer individuals.", "__index_level_0__": 2054, "length": 1547, "pred": {"ppl": 5.9682850838, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0083647217, "ppl/zlib": 0.0004231311, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.5231437348, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.1792258006, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.723876473, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.7527920194, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.0147478704, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.4261898936, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.9429439411}, "question": "What was the verdict of the court in the case of Adhila Nasarin versus State Commissioner of Police?", "answer": "Adhila Nasarin and Fathima Noora were allowed to live their lives according to their informed choice.

{"id": 72525017, "context": "The South Boston Aquarium was a public aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts.\nPrevious Aquariums.\nBoston was one of the first cities in the U.S. to have a public aquarium in the form of the Boston Aquarial Gardens, also known as Cutting and Butler's Grand Aquaria, which opened on Bromfield Street adjacent to Boston Common in 1859. In addition to \"learned\" (trained) Atlantic harbor seals, curious Bostonians could view wood and glass tanks containing marine life kept alive by the oxygenation provided by aquatic plants and James Cutting's patented aerators, although both the water and glass were certainly less clear than in modern aquariums. The Aquarial Gardens existed in one form or another until P. T. Barnum closed the Barnum Aquarial Gardens on Washington Street in 1863.\nHistory.\nThe aquarium was first proposed in the late nineteenth century by the Boston Society of Natural History as an attraction for the newly created Marine Park at City Point in South Boston. However, a lack of funds after the construction of the park prevented the City of Boston from building the aquarium until 1912. The architect, William Downes Austin, had also designed the Detroit Aquarium. The building encompassed of land, and the total cost came to $135,778 ($3,943,835 in 2021). It was developed alongside the Franklin Park Zoo, and both were administered by the Parks Department.\nOriginally intended to be cruciform-shaped like a church with a central nave and two apses, the aquarium building was ultimately \"L\"-shaped without the west apse. A bronze weathervane in the shape of a cod topped the domed nave. Inside, from behind brass railings, visitors could view 55 wooden tanks, lit by natural sunlight during the day and electricity after dark, through plate glass windows. A large pool for Atlantic harbor seals, with a chandelier hanging overhead, occupied the area under the dome, and the gallery of smaller tanks exhibited saltwater and freshwater fishes and turtles. The freshwater exhibits were supplied by city water, while a reservoir of seawater pumped in from Boston Harbor supplied the saltwater exhibits. \nThe aquarium, which reportedly had an annual attendance of 300,000 (and more than 15,000 visitors on its first day alone), was popular, and admission was free. Unlike at previous aquariums in Boston, there was a concerted effort to present animals to visitors in naturalistic exhibits. The exhibits were populated with specimens obtained from other aquariums or on staff collecting trips to the Caribbean. Behind the scenes, as had occurred between Cutting and Butler, there was tension between the curators, who wanted to be seen as a scientific institution, and management, who prioritized drawing crowds. Ultimately, the Great Depression and World War II forced the City of Boston to reallocate most of the aquarium's funding, and Mayor John Hynes finally ordered the neglected facility closed on September 30th, 1954 and the remaining animals sent to other institutions. A tennis court now stands on the former site of the aquarium.\nThe idea of a public aquarium in Boston would remain popular, and a new, privately owned aquarium, the New England Aquarium, would open in 1969.", "__index_level_0__": 4698, "length": 506, "pred": {"ppl": 6.9950156212, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0055051082, "ppl/zlib": 0.0012405598, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.8400563705, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.6222791732, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.9368895745, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.9373802017, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.2226107271, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.638340756, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.1541771145}, "question": "When did the South Boston Aquarium close?", "answer": "September 30th, 1954", "prediction": "Question: When did the South Boston Aquarium close?\nAnswer: September 30th, 1954", "generated_answer": "1969\n\nQ: When"}

This church comes under the administration of the Dhramapuri Diocese.\nHistory.\nAfter 1820 CE, Catholic migrants who settled in Elathagiri also established communities in nearby villages such as Kandikuppam, Kathanpallam, Sunadampatti, Surangottai, Achamangalam, and Pushpagiri. Families like Bappu, Naduveedhi, and Maniam settled in Kathanpallam. Over time, intermarriages with Keerakathi, Thottam, Nesavu, and Sepoy families led to the formation of around 150 Catholic families in this village.\nUntil 1937, deceased Catholics from Katanpallam were interred in the Elathagiri cemetery. However, in 1937, due to a flood, people were unable to cross the river to reach the Elathagiri cemetery. As a result, burials began in Kathanpallam, eventually leading to the establishment of a cemetery in their village itself.\nIn 1995, the Sisters of Gonzaga acquired land in Kathanpallam to build a convent, school, and college. During this period, Fr. M. Arulsamy, the Elathagiri Parish Priest, procured 1.7 acres of land from the Bappu Family to construct a church. The land originally belonged to their late uncle, Soosai (Sepoy), who left it to his nephews. The nephews donated the land for the church, and requested to name the church in honor of St. Joseph, also known as Soosai.\nIn 1997, Fr. M. Arulsamy laid the foundation for a chapel in Kathanpallam, which was later completed by Fr. M. Jegaraj. Former Bishop Joseph Anthony Irudayaraj blessed and inaugurated the chapel on February 13, 1999. Weekly Wednesday masses were conducted by Elathagiri Parish priests in the chapel, and from 2010 onwards, Sunday masses were also held there.\nDue to limited space in the existing chapel, Bishop Lawrence Pius approved the construction of a new church for Kathanpallam. The groundbreaking for this church took place in February 2013 under the guidance of Fr. A. Soosairaj, and construction was completed with the support of villagers and Fr. J. Arokiyasamy. This church was blessed and inaugurated by Dharamapuri Bishop Lawrence Pius on December 23, 2015. In May 2017, this sub-station church gained independence from Elathagiri Parish and was elevated to a Parish church. Fr. Martin became the first parish priest in 2018.\nThe Franciscan Sisters of St. Aloysius Gonzaga established their convent in Kathanpallam in 1998.

{"id": 71903725, "context": "Francium compounds are compounds containing the element francium (Fr). Due to francium being very unstable, its salts are only known to a small extent. Francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which leads to other methods of separation.\nHalides.\nFrancium halides are all soluble in water and are expected to be white solids. They are expected to be produced by the reaction of the corresponding halogens. For example, francium chloride would be produced by the reaction of francium and chlorine. Francium chloride has been studied as a pathway to separate francium from other elements, by using the high vapour pressure of the compound, although francium fluoride would have a higher vapour pressure.\nOther compounds.\nFrancium nitrate, sulfate, hydroxide, carbonate, acetate, and oxalate, are all soluble in water, while the iodate, picrate, tartrate, chloroplatinate, and silicotungstate are insoluble. The insolubility of these compounds are used to extract francium from other radioactive products, such as zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, tin, antimony, the method mentioned in the section above. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium\u2013oxygen bonding. The relativistic destabilisation of the 6p3/2 spinor may make francium compounds in oxidation states higher than +1 possible, such as [FrVF6]\u2212; but this has not been experimentally confirmed. Francium perchlorate is produced by the reaction of francium chloride and sodium perchlorate. The francium perchlorate coprecipitates with caesium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. However, this method is unreliable in separating thallium, which also coprecipitates with caesium. Francium perchlorate's entropy is expected to be 42.7\u00a0e.u (178.7 J mol\u22121 K\u22121).\nThe only double salt known of francium has the formula Fr9Bi2I9.", "__index_level_0__": 1859, "length": 393, "pred": {"ppl": 4.9917850494, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0219580225, "ppl/zlib": 0.0014228262, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.4093352117, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.9257269711, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.3962105807, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.3975711537, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.6813112428, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.109038568, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.6599681881}, "question": "What is the only known double salt of francium?", "answer": "Fr9Bi2I9", "prediction": "Question: What is the only known double salt of francium?\nAnswer: Fr9Bi2I9", "generated_answer": "Fr1000\nQ: Whitney"}

Starring Marlon Wayans, Priah Ferguson, Kelly Rowland, John Michael Higgins, Lauren Lapkus, Rob Riggle, and Nia Vardalos, the film was released by Netflix on October 14, 2022.\nPlot.\nSydney Gordon is a brave, adventurous girl who believes in ghosts and has a strained relationship with her science-obsessed father, Howard. When the Gordon family moves from Brooklyn to a small town called Bridge Hollow, Syd is intrigued\u2014 and Howard uneasy \u2014about the town\u2019s obsession with Halloween. Syd meets her new school\u2019s Paranormal Society: nerdy Mario, quiet Jamie, and the Society\u2019s goth girl leader, Ramona; the Society inform Syd that she now lives in a house generally perceived to be haunted. When Syd attempts to contact the ghost who supposedly lives in the house, she finds a strange, shriveled Jack-o-Lantern in a treasure chest in the storage room.\nDespite Howard\u2019s clear contempt for Halloween, his wife and Syd\u2019s mother Emily interests herself in making vegan snacks for the local Stingy Jack festival, and Syd rebels against her father by putting up Halloween decorations, lighting the lantern she found, and dressing up like a witch. However, when Howard attempts to put out the lantern, red light spreads from the lantern and turns a bat prop in the trash into a real bat with glowing red eyes that taunts Howard and Syd before flying away and spreading its curse to witch decorations, which come to life and fly into the sky. Syd witnesses this, and tries to tell Howard, but Howard insists there must be a logical explanation, even when he witnesses Syd and their neighbor, Sully, fighting off a group of prop zombies that have also come to life. Syd learns from Sully that the descendant of the woman who died in the house is still alive and elderly in a nursing home, and she takes Howard to discuss the lantern with the woman, who tells them that when lit, the lantern unleashed the curse of Stingy Jack, who will then take a soul at midnight to take his place so he can \u201cmake every day Halloween\u201d. \nAfter fighting off spider dummies that have came to life as the curse spreads, Howard confides in Syd that he hates Halloween because when he was a young boy, his friends dared him to explore a creepy abandoned house, where he fell down into the floorboards and hallucinated a bunch of living skeletons closing in on them. Syd meets up with the Paranormal Society at her school and explains what happened; while there, the group find out that a resident of their town has a page torn from a spell book that could help them re-trap Jack inside of the lantern. They go to the address of the person who has the page only to find it is their school principal, who owns a lot of Satanic propaganda and gives them floss as candy. The group manage to find the page, but before they can memorize the incantation, the curse spreads to a group of skeleton football players used as props in the principal\u2019s yard. The group are unable to beat back the skeletons due to the helmets they wear and Howard\u2019s fear of skeletons keeping him from joining in. When the page is thrown into the burning fireplace and the group are cornered in the principal\u2019s basement, Syd gives Howard a pep talk which helps him resolve his fear of skeletons, and he fights back them all with a chainsaw and Bruce Lee-inspired combat moves. As the rest of the Halloween decorations go to congregate as an army at the Stingy Jack festival, the group goes to a crypt so they can find out the incantation for the spell from the original owner of the spellbook, the ghost who supposedly haunts Syd\u2019s new house.\nWhile the Paranormal Society and the principal go to the town square to stop the Halloween decorations from attacking the town, Syd and Howard realize that Emily has left the festival and is at home with the lantern, and go back to their house to return Stingy Jack to his lantern\u2014 a statue of Stingy Jack used for the festival is possessed by Stingy Jack and threatens Emily, mistaking her for the one who found his lantern and the one whose soul should take his place. Howard attempts the incantation to bind Jack several times as he tries to take Emily away, but Syd reminds him he has to believe in it for it to work, and after Howard says the incantation while believing, Jack is successfully banished again, and all the other Halloween decorations, who are mid-showdown with the rest of the town, fall down, inanimate again. \nAfter what they\u2019ve gone through, Howard becomes more accepting of Halloween, Syd joins the Paranormal Society, and Emily begins to bake treats that aren\u2019t vegan, claiming \u201cyou only live once\u201d. Syd and Howard go to the storage room to reflect on what happened to them, and find more treasure chests hidden away. Reminded of Jack\u2019s curse, they both reply \u201cOh hell no!\u201d\nReception.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 46% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10.

{"id": 50330214, "context": "Lemonade is a musical film and visual album created by American singer Beyonc\u00e9, and serves as a visual companion to her 2016 album of the same name. Beyonc\u00e9 also contributes as a director and executive producer for the film. It premiered on HBO on April 23, 2016.\nPremise.\nThe film is divided into eleven chapters, titled \"Intuition\", \"Denial\", \"Anger\", \"Apathy\", \"Emptiness\", \"Accountability\", \"Reformation\", \"Forgiveness\", \"Resurrection\", \"Hope\", and \"Redemption\". The film uses poetry and prose written by British-Somali poet Warsan Shire; the poems adapted were \"The Unbearable Weight of Staying\", \"Dear Moon\", \"How to Wear Your Mother's Lipstick\", \"Nail Technician as Palm Reader\", and \"For Women Who Are Difficult to Love\".\nPlot.\nThe film opens with a shot of Beyonc\u00e9 leaning against a car in a parking garage, her face obscured by her fur coat, before cutting to a desolate Fort Macomb, interspersed with shots of Beyonc\u00e9 dressed in a black hoodie amongst the reeds and on an empty stage with closed red curtains.\nIntuition: On a plantation, scenes of Black women in dressed white standing solemnly are accompanied by a recitation of the first poem, and Beyonc\u00e9 begins with \"Pray You Catch Me\" in an old metal bathtub. She emerges from the stage onto a rooftop and leaps as the song ends, plunging into deep waters.\nDenial: Floating underwater, Beyonc\u00e9 unzips her hoodie, revealing a skin-toned bustier. She swims into a grand submerged bedroom where she comes upon a version of herself resting on a bed. She begins floating and rapidly contorting underwater before emerging from the bedroom and out of a courthouse onto a street in a flowing yellow frilled dress. (\"Hold Up\").\nBeyonc\u00e9 walks down a busy city street and picks up a baseball bat. She smashes in car windows in rage as onlookers cheer. She strikes a fire hydrant that begins to spray water as children run to play. She breaks a security camera and a storefront window as fire explodes behind her. She menacingly approaches the camera and strikes it, before boarding a monster truck. She uses the monster truck to squash vintage cars, and drives off in the distance.\nAnger: A high school band accompanied by majorettes parade down a suburban street. In an abandoned parking garage, women dance in unison in long white dresses with their sleeves tied to each other. A lone female drummer plays in solitude as dancers in black begin to approach an SUV. A ring of fire is ignited as \"Don't Hurt Yourself\" begins.\nBeyonc\u00e9, hair braided in cornrows, clad in a tight grey tank top and leggings two-piece and draped in a fur coat, sings aggressively as the song is interrupted by Malcolm X's speech \"Who Taught You to Hate Yourself?\", speaking about how the most discriminated person in America is the black woman. The song resumes with shots of Beyonc\u00e9 wandering the parking garage in a wedding dress, and sitting in the ring of fire in a red dress. An intertitle declares \"GOD IS GOD AND I AM NOT\" before she throws her wedding ring at the camera.\nApathy: In a bus, dancers in tribal paint and hair braided in traditional African styles dance in unison as Beyonc\u00e9 solemnly looks on. In a plantation mansion, Serena Williams wanders the halls and dances in front of Beyonc\u00e9 as she sings \"Sorry\". The song ends as Beyonc\u00e9 sits crosslegged in an empty room dressed in a metallic bra set with her hair braided similarly to Nefertiti's crown. Naked women wander a field as the film fades to black.\nEmptiness: \"Dear Moon\" is recited accompanied by visuals of a plantation mansion bathed in an eerie blood-red glow. The camera slowly zooms in on a windowed door as the thumping beat of \"6 Inch\" begins, cutting to scenes of Beyonc\u00e9 riding in a vintage Cadillac at night. The scene cuts to Beyonc\u00e9 in a room surrounded by other women dressed in black as she swings a lightbulb above her head. The word \"LOSS\" flashes as the window explodes into fire. Beyonc\u00e9 begins dancing seductively on a stage behind glass, intercut with scenes of her dressed in a grand white dress lying on a bed before walking down a hallway as it begins to catch aflame. The song ends with Beyonc\u00e9 and a group of people standing outside the mansion as it burns behind them.\nAccountability: Little girls run around and play in a mansion, while a mother and her daughter sit in a bedroom. It cuts into an interview with a man recounting his experience meeting then-President Obama as he drives through a storm. The interview is intercut with super 8 footage of the man with his family in a New Orleans neighborhood. The film cuts back to a tunnel in Fort Macomb as Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"Daddy Lessons\" with a guitarist. The song is interrupted by childhood home videos of Beyonc\u00e9 and her father Mathew Knowles, as well as videos of him playing with his granddaughter Blue Ivy, before resuming to more footage of life in New Orleans, such as families playing and a jazz funeral.\nReformation: Beyonc\u00e9 lies in an empty playing field in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome as \"Love Drought\" begins, cutting to scenes of women dressed in white walking in a line into the ocean, alluding to the mass suicide of captured Africans at Igbo Landing, who chose to drown themselves over a life of slavery.\nForgiveness: In a sparsely furnished house, she plays \"Sandcastles\" on the piano, intercut with scenes of a child's drawings, wilted flowers, decorative objects, and a fireplace. She sings to Jay-Z as they caress and embrace each other.\nResurrection: A gathering of black women in dressed in white dresses in a historic park. \"Forward\" begins as black women hold up pictures of deceased relatives, including the mothers of black men whose deaths galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement. A Mardi Gras Indian circles around a dining room table shaking a tambourine.\nHope: \"Freedom\" begins as Beyonc\u00e9 sings the first verse acapella on an outdoor stage at night. A dancer begins dancing to the instrumental break, intercut with footage of women sitting under a large willow tree and having a communal dinner, and Winnie Harlow wearing a crown of thorns.\nRedemption: Scenes of black women caring for themselves in the mansion are shown as Beyonc\u00e9 recites the last poem. The film cuts to footage of Jay-Z's grandmother, Hattie White, celebrating her 90th birthday as she delivers a speech on overcoming hardship, marking how she was served lemons but made lemonade. Scenes of women on a plantation coming together and tending to a communal garden are seen, as the final song \"All Night\" begins with Beyonc\u00e9 now back at Fort Macomb at sunset, wearing an elaborate dress. She sings to joyful footage of families, couples, and home videos of herself with Jay-Z and her own family.\nThe film concludes with the music video for \"Formation\".\nCast.\nThe film's cast features Ibeyi, Laolu Senbanjo, Amandla Stenberg, Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, Chloe x Halle, Zendaya and Serena Williams. In \"Forward\", the mothers of Trayvon Martin (Sybrina Fulton), Michael Brown (Lesley McFadden), and Eric Garner (Gwen Carr) are featured holding pictures of their deceased sons. Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9's daughter Blue Ivy appears in home video footage at one point, as does Jay-Z's grandmother Hattie White, and Beyonc\u00e9's mother Tina Knowles, who is shown with her second husband Richard Lawson on their wedding day in 2015.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nMiriam Bale for \"Billboard\" called \"Lemonade\" \"a revolutionary work of Black feminism\" as \"a movie made by a black woman, starring Black women, and for Black women\", in which Beyonc\u00e9 is seen gathering, uniting and leading Black women throughout the film. As well as relating the story of Beyonc\u00e9's relationship with her husband, \"Lemonade\" also chronicles the relationship between Black women and American society. The includes how the United States betrayed and continually mistreats Black women, with society needing to solve its problems in order to enable reformation and the rehabilitation of Black women. As part of reverting the societal oppression and silencing of Black women, \"Lemonade\" centralizes the experiences of Black women in a way that is not often seen in the media, and celebrates their achievements despite the adversity they face.\nIn June 2016, Matthew Fulks sued Beyonc\u00e9, Sony Music, Columbia Records and Parkwood Entertainment for allegedly lifting nine visual elements of his short film \"Palinoia\" for the trailer for \"Lemonade\". The lawsuit was subsequently dismissed by New York federal judge Jed S. Rakoff, siding with the defendant.", "__index_level_0__": 32, "length": 1392, "pred": {"ppl": 6.665099144, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0204187253, "ppl/zlib": 0.0004887619, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.4962045763, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.2400940726, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.8114392614, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.8350511752, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.132598822, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.5754233436, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.1036980055}, "question": "What is the genre of the film \"Lemonade\" created by Beyonc\u00e9?", "answer": "Musical film", "prediction": "Question: What is the genre of the film \"Lemonade\" created by Beyonc\u00e9?\nAnswer: Musical film", "generated_answer": "visual album\n\nQ: On what date will"}

{"id": 72673402, "context": "Str\u012b-dharma-paddhati is an 18th-century Sanskrit-language text written by the court pandit Tryambaka-yajvan in the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom of present-day Tamil Nadu, India. It outlines the duties of women from an orthodox Hindu point of view, based on several shruti, smriti, and puranic texts. A strongly patriarchal text, it assigns a subservient role to women, and suggests that they can achieve salvation only through complete devotion to their husbands. Like the \"dharma-shastra\" texts it quotes, the norms presented in the text are a mixture of contemporary social reality and what the author considers to be the ideal behavior.\nAuthorship and date.\nTryambaka-yajvan, the writer of \"Str\u012b-dharma-paddhati\" (\"Guide to the Religious Status and Duties of Women\"), was an orthodox pandit from Thanjavur. He was a pupil of Yajnesha (IAST: Yaj\u00f1e\u015ba), and a court pandit and minister of the Thanjavur Maratha king Serfoji I.\nThe text does not mention the exact date of its composition, but quotes \"Dharm\u0101k\u016bta\" (1719), another work by Tryambakayajvan. The author died in 1750, so \"Str\u012b-dharma-paddhati\" must have been composed sometime between 1719 and 1750 CE.\nContents.\nIntroduction.\nAt the beginning of the text, Tryambaka invokes Ganadhipati, Sarasvati, and his teachers. The text focuses on married women, and Tryambaka declares that the primary religious duty of women is to obediently serve their husbands. He states that he has compiled sacred laws related to women from various texts including the law books (dhrama-shastras) and the Puranas.\nThe daily duties of women.\nTryambaka divides the night (and presumably the day) into six periods, and specifies various activities that the women should engage during each period. In the morning, a woman is expected to rise before her husband (who, according to the six-fold division of night, is expected to rise at 4 am).\nIn addition to several duties traditionally prescribed for men (such as personal hygiene), Tryambaka assigns various household tasks to women, such as food preparation, house cleaning, smearing the house with cow dung, tending to her children, tending to the cows, and massaging her husband.\nA woman is also expected to perform ritual worship of threshold (including sketching of auspicious designs), and assist her husband in performing ritual sacrifices. According to Tryambaka, a wife should worship only three deities: her husband, and the two sister goddesses - Shri (Lakshmi) and Jyestha (Alakshmi).\nWhen the husband eats, the wife is expected to serve him, and eat his leftovers. At night, she is expected to engage in sexual intercourse. Several of these duties, including a variety of sex positions, are illustrated in the book's palm-leaf manuscripts, now at the British Library.\nTryambaka does not make any provisions for a woman to rest, and lists day-time sleep among the things that corrupt women (and therefore should be avoided). Women are not expected to visit friends or study.\nTryambaka provides detailed instructions for several daily tasks. For example, he quotes Angiras' instructions on urinating and defecating:\nHe gives several modifying rules for tasks common to men and women. For example, he quotes Shankha for instructions on dressing:\nHe also provides different rules for menstruating women and widows. For example, these women (and women whose husbands are away) should avoid things (such as ornaments and flowers) that make them attractive.\nThe text states a woman should not answer back if her husband scolds her, or show anger and resentment if her husband beats her. The only exception is love-making, during which it is acceptable for a woman to strike her husband, scratch him, show anger towards him, or use harsh words as an expression of her passion.\nThe inherent nature of women.\nLike several other orthodox authorities, Tryambaka portrays women as inherently sinful, born as female because of sins in their previous births. He quotes \"Manu-smrti\", \"Mahabharata\" and \"Ramayana\" to assert that women are naturally inclined to fickle-mindedness, habitual lying, unfaithfulness, and other bad qualities. Like these authorities, he also talks about the virtuous behaviour of women, without explaining the implicit contradiction.\nTryambaka suggests that women have not fallen too low, and therefore, capable of receiving instructions specified in his book. He quotes Manu and other authorities to state that women have some inherently good qualities such as purity and good fortune.\nThis concept of menstrual purity seems to be symbolic, since Tryambaka insists that a woman who behaves badly cannot escape penalties through ritual atonement (\"prayashchitta\"). Nevertheless, he states that women are blessed to have \"the easiest path to heaven\" - that of worshipping their husbands. Lastly, he argues that his instructions are useful for women because good conduct can destroy the inauspicious marks of one's nature or circumstances. Tryambaka uses these arguments to prove the usefulness of his text, and to persuade women to conform to the good behavior as specified by him.\nThe duties common to all women.\nTryambaka outlines rulings on women's behavior from various texts; things that women should avoid; quotations praising wives devoted to their husbands (\"pati-vrata\"); duties and prohibitions specific to menstruating women, pregnant women, women whose husbands are away, and widows.\nFor example, according to him, the following six things corrupt a woman: drinking, keeping bad company, extramarital affairs, roaming around by herself, sleeping during the day, and spending time in other people's homes. The following six things cause women (and Shudras) to fall: recitation of sacred texts, ritual austerities (\"tapas\"), pilgrimage, renunciation (\"pravrajya\"), chanting of mantras, and worship of deities (other than her husband as long as the husband is alive).\nTryambaka states that a woman should never do anything independently, at any age, even in her own home: she should be subservient to her father as a child, to her husband as a wife, and to her sons as a widow. Regarding women's property rights, Tryambaka attempts to reconcile various contradictory authorities. For example, he lists the six types of property that a woman can own (e.g. given to her by her relatives), but states that a married woman needs her husband's permission to exercise her property rights. He also outlines certain exceptions to this rule; for example, a woman can make an occasional religious donation without her husband's permission, when he is away. Tryambaka also states that a woman's male relatives - including her husband - cannot use her property without her permission.\nAccording to Tryambaka, the best thing a widow can do is die with her husband (sati). If this is not possible (e.g. because she is caring for an infant), she should lead a chaste and virtuous life, and remain dependent on her male relatives. Tryambaka discusses various arguments for and against the practice of \"niyoga\", which allows a widow without a son to have sexual intercourse with another man to produce a son. He favours celibacy and adoption of a son over \"niyoga\".\nConclusion.\nTryambaka concludes that the primary religious duty of a woman is obedient service to her husband, without any regard for her own life: she should obey his commands even if they are in opposition to other religious duties. He quotes various episodes from religious texts to prove his point. For example, he refers to the story of Harishchandra to state that it is acceptable for a husband to sell his wife.\nThe author concludes by stating that he has included content from various texts (shruti, smriti, and puranas) in his work only after thorough examination. In the colophon, he dedicates his work to Krishna.\nManuscripts and printed edition.\nThree Devanagari manuscripts of the text are available at the Saraswathi Mahal Library in Thanjavur. Copyist P.S. Lalitha made a hand-written copy of one of these manuscripts for academic Julia Leslie in 1981. Another Devanagari manuscript exists at the Oriental Research Institute Mysore. A Telugu manuscript titled \"Str\u012b-dharma-sa\u1e45graha\" at Vizianagaram Fort is listed in V. Raghavan's \"New Catalogus Catalogorum\", but Leslie was unable to find it.\nA printed version of the text, titled \"Tryambaka-raya-makhini-baddha strinam avasyika dharma-paddhatih\", exists with a Tamil translation. The text does not mention the name of its date, editor, translator or publisher. According to Chandrashekarendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti Math, this text was edited and translated in 1917-20 by Panchapagesa Sastri (brother of T. Ganapati Sastri) of his organization.\nAssessment.\nThe text predates the 19th century social reforms of British India, and thus, is an important source of information about the life of the orthodox Hindu women at the Thanjavur Maratha court. Academic Julia Leslie notes that according to modern anthropological research, the prescriptions in various Hindu texts are not followed in reality. This must have also been true for 18th-century Thanjavur: not all the religious ideals outlined in the \"Str\u012b-dharma-paddhati\" were followed there. Thus, like other dharma-shastra texts, the norms presented in the text are a mixture of reality and the author's ideals.\nAccording to academic Sharada Sugirtharajah, \"Tryambaka assigns a subservient role to women, who are seen as essentially wicked and in need of patriarchal monitoring and control; it is only through their \"str\u012bdharma\" (devotion) and service to their husbands, that they can become good or virtuous.\" Sugirtharajah notes that the text is not a reflection of the social reality, and the 19th century colonial discourse incorrectly tended to assume that the Hindu society relied entirely on textual authority. Other contemporary and near-contemporary texts (such as Muddupalani's \"Radhika-santvanam\") offer a more liberative image of women.\nAccording to Julia Leslie, the Thanjavur Marathas - who were Marathi-speaking Hindus - faced a cultural isolation, as they governed a Tamil territory and struggled to retain their independence against the Muslim Mughals. Trymbaka responded to this isolation by writing a work that reinforced his own cultural ideals.", "__index_level_0__": 5420, "length": 1555, "pred": {"ppl": 6.4727253914, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0235484161, "ppl/zlib": 0.0004324143, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.4345411071, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.206691591, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.7669890424, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.8102810567, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.0841054491, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.5021605825, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.0337577366}, "question": "What is the primary religious duty of a woman according to the \"Str\u012b-dharma-paddhati\"?", "answer": "Obedient service to her husband", "prediction": "Question: What is the primary religious duty of a woman according to the \"Str\u012b-dharma-paddhati\"?\nAnswer: Obedient service to her husband", "generated_answer": "performing puja for her husband regularly\n\nQ"}

{"id": 71753674, "context": "Otto Sigfrid Reuter (2 September 1876 \u2013 5 April 1945) was a German writer and organiser who was central in the neopagan current within the \"v\u00f6lkisch\" movement. He founded some of the earliest organisations for Germanic neopaganism, which were rooted in the racial ideologies of the \"v\u00f6lkisch\" movement. Reuter promoted a decentralised version of pagan practice without priests, in contrast to the hierarchically structured of Ludwig Fahrenkrog.\nEarly life and career.\n\"Otto\" Theodor Ludwig \"Sigfrid\" Reuter was born on 2 September 1876 in Leer, East Frisia. His father Wilhelm Reuter was a merchant captain and director of the naval school in Leer. His mother Emma was the daughter of the pastor and theologian Friedrich Armknecht. Reuter was a half brother of Ernst Reuter who became the Governing Mayor of Berlin.\nAfter passing his in Leer in 1894, Reuter worked as a telegraphist in Oldenburg, Cologne and Bonn. From 1901 he studied history and law in Bonn. Having passed a in 1905, he worked in Berlin and Elberfeld, and from 1917 in Bremen as a telegraph director and head of the telephone system. His career in telecommunications ended in 1924 due to staff reductions and his activities as a agitator.\n\"V\u00f6lkisch\"-religious activities.\nIn 1910, Reuter published the pamphlet \"Sigfrid oder Christus?!\" () where he argued that Christianity is alien to the Germans and promoted a renewal of pre-Christian Germanic religiosity. He held Sigfrid from Germanic heroic legend as a role model and contrasted him with Jesus, who \"wanted us to win victory through suffering and endurance\", writing that \"our religion is that of the champion of light, who finds joy in action and fights his way to peace through victory. That is the language of Sigfrid.\" The pamphlet was well received within the pagan-leaning faction of the emerging \"v\u00f6lkisch\"-religious movement. It was initially published anonymously with the subtitle (), a reference to Julius Langbehn's \"Rembrandt als Erzieher\" (1890) which used the same wording. A second edition in 1910 was published under Reuter's name.\nReuter's activities became tied to two organisations he founded in 1911: the () and the Deutschreligi\u00f6sen Gemeinschaft (). They were among the earliest formally organised groups within Germanic neopaganism and tied to the racial ideologies of the \"v\u00f6lkisch\" movement. Members were required to show an Aryan certificate provided by , editor of the \"Deutsches Geschlechterbuch\". The Deutschreligi\u00f6sen Gemeinschaf, renamed Deutschgl\u00e4ubige Gemeinschaft () in 1914, functioned as an inner circle and was only open for members who formally had left the Christian church.\nReuter's group was contemporaneous with the of Ludwig Fahrenkrog. They were to some extent competitors but also had mutual members. A major difference was Reuter's promotion of a decentralised pagan practice, without priests and formalised rituals, in contrast to Fahrenkrog's preference for a hierarchical organisational structure. Several short-lived attempts were made to unify the early Germanic neopagans in an umbrella organisation. A notable example was the Nordische Glaubensgemeinschaft (), which was founded by Reuter and Norbert Seibertz in 1927 but was dissolved in 1928 when the co-founders fell out. Reuter's own organisations were dissolved in 1933. He was involved in the establishment of the German Faith Movement of Jakob Wilhelm Hauer.\nWithin the \"v\u00f6lkisch\"-religious movement, Reuter's primary contributions were as a theoretician. Especially after his professional career, he conducted research into Germanic subjects, held contact with the scholars Gustav Neckel and Gustaf Kossinna, and formulated a pseudoscientific foundation for the movement's worldview. His most ambitious work was the book \"Germanische Himmelskunde\" (), published in 1934 with support from the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft. Taking inspiration from Kossinna's work on astronomy and mythology, Reuter argued for the existence of an advanced and specifically Germanic star map.\nReuter was a member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Vorgeschichte from 1922 and received its Gustaf-Kossinna-Preis in 1936. In 1938 he was made an honorary member of the . He received an honorary doctorate from the Leipzig University in 1939 through the support of scholars such as Franz Josef Hopmann, Otto Reche, Konstantin Reichardt and . He became a member of the Nazi Party in 1939 and was in contact with the Ahnenerbe. , a historian who specialises in the \"v\u00f6lkisch\" movement, describes Reuter as a major ideologue of the pagan faction within the \"v\u00f6lkisch\"-religious current, with continuing impact in contemporary times, and as one of the many who contributed to an ideologisation of science through his ability to create a bridge between a scientific and a \"v\u00f6lkisch\" worldview.\nPersonal life.\nReuter married his wife Gertrud in 1923. They had two sons and one daughter. He died in Bremen's district in a bomb raid on 5 April 1945.\nPublications.\nBibliography adapted from the \"Neue Deutsche Biographie\"", "__index_level_0__": 1160, "length": 762, "pred": {"ppl": 6.1191592216, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0265793908, "ppl/zlib": 0.0007934405, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.4623204345, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.2339998679, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.6996499941, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.7292479051, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.0029568955, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.4322830627, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.9626712571}, "question": "What were the two organizations founded by Otto Sigfrid Reuter in 1911?", "answer": "The Germanisch-Religi\u00f6se Gemeinschaft (Germanic Religious Community) and the Deutschreligi\u00f6sen Gemeinschaft (German Religious Community)", "prediction": "Question: What were the two organizations founded by Otto Sigfrid Reuter in 1911?\nAnswer: The Germanisch-Religi\u00f6se Gemeinschaft (Germanic Religious Community) and the Deutschreligi\u00f6sen Gemeinschaft (German Religious Community)", "generated_answer": "Scandinavian League Against the Pl"}

UK NACE specialises in technical security, the practice of protecting sensitive information and technology from close access acquisition by hostile threat actors, as well as from any other form of technical manipulation. The aim of UK NACE is to help develop the standards for UK government technical security, provides training and mentoring to national and international partners and carries out research and development of new threats and countermeasure technologies. UK NACE sits under the umbrella of the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, as part of FCDO Services.\nHistory.\nUK NACE evolved from the Diplomatic Wireless Service of Bletchley Park in the 1940s. It started in 1945 after it was found that British embassies in the USSR had been subject to technical espionage. The Foreign Secretary at the time, Ernest Bevin, sent a group of Post Office engineers to certain locations to do \"conservative electrical maintenance\" on the telephone and telegraphy systems, and \"some preventative work such as anti-eavesdropping\".\nIn 1958, UK NACE was recognised as a national authority by the Cabinet Office. From 1960, UK NACE was a part of MI5 before moving back to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office in 1969. In 2008, FCDO Services became a trading fund, allowing UK NACE to offer their services to other government departments, law enforcement and some List X companies.\nIn 2020, UK NACE became a public authority under Schedule 4 of the Investigatory Powers Act, with the power to authorise collection of communications data in support of national security.\nOperations.\nUK NACE's main aims are to ensure that the most sensitive, classified areas within the UK government estate are protected.

Haddock has acted in many films and telenovelas.\nEarly life.\nHaddock was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, to Korean War veteran Jorge Haddock and Francisca Acevedo, who was a teacher. When Haddock was four, her parents divorced, and she and her siblings were largely raised by their mother. Haddock's father, however, instilled in her a love for the arts, teaching her how to draw. By age five, young Gilda already showed that she was comfortable in public, being usually picked by teachers to host several school shows and also a first grade graduation.\nHaddock was also interested in dancing; she studied ballet with famed dancer Tony D'Astro in D'Astro's Caguas academy, being taught there also by D'Astro's dance partner, Nydia Rivera.\nHaddock as a teenager joined the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, hoping to become a lawyer. At that same time, she joined D'Astro's ballet group as a dancer, where she met and danced alongside, among others, Gladys Nu\u00f1ez, and also became interested in theater. While at UPR, Haddock noticed that drama students were always hanging out near the university's theater and she started desiring to join the university's theater program, which she eventually did.\nHaddock joined a theater company named \"Teatro del Sesenta\", and, there, she took acting classes under Gilda Navarro. Fellow Puerto Rican, Luis Oliva, was also a member of \"Teatro del Sesenta\" and Navarro student.\nProfessional career.\nSoon after, Haddock was hired for a show produced by Tommy Muniz named \"Esto No Tiene Nombre\" (\"This Has No Name\"), a Puerto Rican television comedy program.

It was not successful in the UK, but became very successful in the Netherlands. It became more successful after being covered by the Dave Clark Five as \"The Red Balloon\".\nIn an interview in 1972, Raymond Froggatt said that the song \"becoming such a massive hit was one of the worst things that ever happened\", as \"people still haven't forgotten about it. Now when we play colleges the kids still think we'll be doing that kind of stuff\". By 1972, the song had been recorded by sixteen different artists and sold over three million worldwide sales.\nThe Dave Clark Five version.\nThe Dave Clark Five's version was released in September 1968 and became a top-ten hit in several territories, including the UK. It was included on the UK album \"5 by 5\", but was not included on any US album.\nBackground and release.\nDave Clark first heard \"Callow-la-vita\" on the radio and several weeks later contacted the publishers asking if they expected anything to become of the song, to which they said no. He then said that he wanted to cover the song so long as he could change the title, some of the lyrics and have a different arrangement. The publishers agreed and the Dave Clark Five recorded the song as \"The Red Balloon\". Recorded at Lansdowne Studios, the band were joined by trumpet session musicians, and the brass and saxophone arrangements were done by Les Reed. The lead vocals were by Dave Clark, which was the only Dave Clark Five single to do so. They were intended to be by usual lead singer Mike Smith, but \"he couldn\u2019t get to grips with it\". The song also includes a verse in French, which had to be written down phonetically as Clark didn't speak the language and he later said \"I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was singing about until Top Of The Pops put a translation on screen\". \nAfter the single's release, Polydor then re-released Raymond Froggatt's original version with the title \"The Red Balloon\".\nReception.\nReviewing the Dave Clark Five version and the reissue of Raymond Froggatt's version for \"New Musical Express\", Derek Johnson wrote that \"it's an extremely catchy tune, with a lyrical, flowing quality and the Froggatt team treats it with a delicacy and piquancy ideally suited to the subject matter\".

{"id": 74648857, "context": "Ethel May Vaughan-Sawyer (6 July 1868 \u2013 9 March 1949) was a British gynaecological surgeon. She was described by pioneering physician and feminist Louisa Garrett Anderson as \"100 times better at her work than I am\". A champion of women's rights to work and take part in political life, Vaughan-Sawyer described herself as an example of \"healthy normal womanhood usefully and happily employed\".\nLife.\nEthel May Vaughan was born on 6 July 1868 in Derby, the oldest of eight children born to Cedric Vaughan and Jane Ellen Ridley. Her father was a locomotive engineer, who from 1872 was manager of the Hodbarrow Mining Company in Cumberland, where the family moved.\nWith her two younger sisters, Ethel was educated at a private school in Bottesford, Leicestershire, and later in Lausanne. From 1889, she studied at University College London, and in 1891 entered the London School of Medicine for Women, where she excelled. She graduated BS and MB in 1896, and MD in 1898.\nIn 1907, Vaughan married George Henry Vaughan-Sawyer, a captain and author. The marriage was happy and their daughter, Petronella Grace, was born on 31 August 1908. George Henry Vaughan-Sawyer was killed in action in 1914. Petronella Grace, a designer and illustrator, died in 1931 at the age of 22.\nMedical career.\nIn 1897, Vaughan became assistant medical officer to Camberwell Infirmary. She subsequently became curator of the Royal Free Hospital's museum, and in 1899 clinical assistant to physician Raymond Crawfurd. In 1901, she spent time in Paris with fellow physician Louisa Garrett Anderson, visiting French hospitals.\nBy that year, Vaughan had established a private practice from her home in Brompton Square, South Kensington, alongside her friend Dr. Kate Marion Hunter. When, a year later, Mary Scharlieb was appointed physician for the diseases of women at the Royal Free Hospital, Vaughan was made her assistant. Scharlieb described Vaughan as both \"a great pleasure to work with\" and \"one of the best and most skilful surgeons of the next generation\".\nOn Scharlieb's retirement in 1908, Vaughan took over, assisted by Florence Willey. Vaughan also lectured at her alma mater, the London School of Medicine for Women. Following the birth of her daughter in August 1908, Vaughan (now Vaughan-Sawyer) returned to the operating table in November proving, as Claire Brock has written, \"that medical women were more than capable of combining the roles of surgeon, wife, and mother.\" At the Royal Free Hospital, Vaughan's surgical skill was evident, as was her interest in new and developing surgeries, detailed in her case notes. Vaughan-Sawyer also retained a private practice in Harley Street, and was actively involved in both the Royal Society of Medicine's obstetric and gynaecological division, and the Association of Registered Medical Women. She lectured widely, and was a member of the Fabian Women's Group.\nIn 1920, Vaughan-Sawyer was part of a committee seeking to establish scholarships for Serbian women to train in medicine at the Royal Free Hospital.\nVaughan-Sawyer remained at the Royal Free Hospital until 1926, when her eyesight began to fail and she retired from her post. Two years later, she became the Royal Free Hospital's consulting gynaecologist.\nDeath and legacy.\nVaughan-Sawyer died on 9 March 1949 in hospital in Northwood, Middlesex, having lived for two years in St John's Guest House for the Blind in Worthing. On her death, a correspondent to \"The Times\" described her as having spoken of all the \"calamities\" of her life - and everything else - \"with robust humour and a philosophy that had its roots in her deep and living faith.\" Her obituary in the same paper remembered her as \"for many years a noted gynaecologist and obstetrician\".

{"id": 72831209, "context": "During the 17th through 19th centuries, there are at least thirty documented New York Witch Trials, hearings and prosecutions of people accused of witchcraft in the Province of New York. Several of the witchcraft cases in New York pre-dated the Salem witch trials.\nWitchcraft in New York.\nWitchcraft was a phenomenon that was of concern for colonial inhabitants of New Netherland (now New York). European settlers brought several superstitions with them to the New World, including their beliefs in the devil\u2019s power, demons, and witches. During William Kieft's term as Director of New Netherland from 1638 to 1647, he expressed great animosity towards local Indigenous peoples and accused them of cursing him.\nHowever, New York saw fewer witch trials than other early settlements due, in part, to the large Dutch influence in the province\u2019s early history and the influence of New York\u2019s Reformed Church community in opposing the practice of witch trials.\nThe entire history of witchcraft in New York is challenging to track, primarily due to the general lack of documentation from the accusations and trials, and the destruction of original records in the March 1911 fire at the New York State Capitol building.\nAs of 2012, four New York residents are listed as qualifying ancestors in the Associated Daughters of Early American Witches Roll of Ancestors.\nProminent figures.\nElizabeth \"Goody\" Garlick.\nIn 1657-1658, Elizabeth \"Goody\" Garlick, a resident of East Hampton, was accused and tried for witchcraft following the mysterious death of a 16-year-old girl named Elizabeth, the daughter of Lion Gardiner, an English engineer and colonist who founded the first English settlement in New York. According to the court records, her trial had been for \"some detestable and wicked Arts, commonly called Witchcraft and Sorcery, [you] did (as is suspected) maliciously and feloniously, practice at the said town of Seatalcott in the East Riding of Yorkshire on Long Island.\" The jury and magistrate, which included John Winthrop the Younger, found Garlick not guilty, but did find \"grounds for suspicion.\" After the trial, Garlick continued to live in East Hampton with her husband.\nRalph and Mary Hall.\nIn 1665, Ralph and Mary Hall of Setauket were accused of witchcraft and causing the death of their neighbor, George Wood, along with his child. A three-year witch hunt, investigations, and trials followed where the Halls found themselves fighting for their freedom and livelihoods in the court system, only to eventually be released and acquitted of all charges by order of Colonial Governor Richard Nicolls in 1668.\nKatherine Harrison.\nIn June of 1670, after being convicted of witchcraft in a trial in Wethersfield, Connecticut, Katherine Harrison moved to Westchester County, New York as an order of the court and with hopes of escaping the vandalism and demolishing of her property by neighbors. Shortly after, residents in Westchester complained about her presence and ordered her to leave the city, but once she was brought into court in June of 1670, Westchester was allowed her to live where she pleased. In early 1672, Harrison sued 11 of her neighbors for defamation of property.\nWinifred Benham.\nIn 1690s, Winifred King Benham and her daughter Winifred were thrice tried for witchcraft in Wallingford, Connecticut, the last of such trials in New England. Even though they were found innocent, they were compelled to leave Wallingford and settle in Staten Island.\nWitch of Esperance.\nIn the late 1700s, an unnamed woman known as the \"Witch of Esperance,\" near Cobleskill, was a French woman residing in the town after her husband's death. She was accused of witchcraft by local residents and blamed for causing failed crops and livestock deaths. The woman did not speak English and was not able to defend herself against the accusations. Instead of charging her through the justice system, local villagers instead decided to shoot her through window as she prepared dinner one evening. Due to their belief that burying a witch under a tree could prevent her from \"enacting revenge\" on them in the afterlife, the woman was buried upside down in an unmarked grave under a pine tree on the north side of the village.\nJane Kanniff.\nLocal Rockland County, New York historian Dr. Frank Bertangue Green published recollections of an oral history describing a witch trial that had occurred in the town of Clarkstown. According to Green's 1886 book, \"The History of Rockland County\", Jane Kanniff, a twice-married widow and medicinal herbalist, became the target of witchcraft accusations after a series of incidents in which local housewives\u2019 butter churned badly, and a cow failed to produce milk after being found standing in a wagon. According to Green, a witchcraft trial for Ms. Kanniff took place in around 1815 in a local mill, but no further outcome is recorded.\nLegacy.\nIn 2017, the New York Historical Society, New York Folklore Society, and William G.

While Idabel (the county seat) officially desegregated its schools in 1954, the town maintained two neighborhood high schools to maintain de facto segregation for more than a decade. In 1980, the killing of Henry Johnson, a Black teenager, resulted in a riot that killed two more people. McCurtain County is one of Oklahoma's most racially diverse counties, but remains highly economically and racially segregated.\nOn March 6, the \"McCurtain Gazette-News\" brought suit against the McCurtain County Board of County Commissioners, the county Sheriff's Office, Sheriff Kevin Clardy, and county investigator Alicia Manning in federal court. According to the lawsuit, the newspaper published an eight-part investigative series from 2021 to 2022. The series covered the county jail, botched homicide investigations, and rumors of an affair between Clardy and Manning as well as various allegations of corruption. The same day \"McCurtain Gazette-News\" publisher Bruce Willingham left a voice-activated audio recorder inside a room after a county meeting because he suspected people were conducting county business after meetings had ended in violation of the state's Open Meeting Act.\nFormer McCurtain County Sheriff's Office officials have claimed the department has a toxic culture, alleging officers fantasized about killing unarmed Black protestors during the 2020 George Floyd protests. After the recording's release, Oklahoma attorney general Gentner Drummond revealed his office had begun investigating corruption in the county two weeks earlier, saying, \"there is something rotten in McCurtain County.\u201d\nAudio recording.\nIn April 2023, the \"McCurtain Gazette-News\" released audio recordings of local officials discussing hiring a hit man to murder the paper's publisher and reporter Chris Willingham. In the recording, they also lamented that lynching Black people was no longer acceptable, discussed assaulting local judges, and complained Black people had more rights than they did.\nInvestigations.\nThe Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and Attorney General Gentner Drummond investigated the incident. After the investigation, Drummond announced he found no grounds under Oklahoma law to remove the elected officials and encouraged citizens not to reelect the officials in the next election.\nThe FBI has stated it does not confirm or deny active investigations.\nThe McCurtain County Sheriff's Office is investigating the newspaper for the alleged illegality of the audio recording. The office alleges both that the recording was altered and that its production violated the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which requires one party to consent to recording.\nResponses.\nOklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt said that he was \"both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain County\". He called for the local officials to resign, including \"McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy, District 2 Commissioner Mark Jennings, Investigator Alicia Manning, and Jail Administrator Larry Hendrix.\" He later said his office was looking to impeach Clardy if he did not resign and formally requested attorney general Gentner Drummond to investigate Clardy. State representative Eddy Dempsey, Idabel mayor Craig Young, and state senator George Burns also called for the officials' resignations. Congressman Josh Brecheen called for those involved to be \"held accountable.\" Over 100 people gathered outside the county courthouse calling on the officials to resign.\nIn response, the McCurtain County Sheriff's Office released a statement on Facebook reading:\nA \"Tulsa World\" editorial described the incident as white supremacist and racist because of Jennings's comments about missing the days when law enforcement could arrest Black people and \"take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a rope\u201d. It also called on the officials to resign or be removed from office.\nAftermath.\nOn April 18, the Oklahoma Sheriff's Association suspended Clardy, Manning and Hendrix. In May, Hendrix was put on paid leave.\nAlso on April 18, there was a bomb threat against the McCurtain County Memorial Hospital in Idabel, Oklahoma. The day before the bomb threat, the hospital went on a precautionary lockdown during peaceful protests in the town.\nJennings's resignation.\nJennings resigned on April19. Governor Stitt set a special election for September 12, 2023. On June 13, Republican Tina Foshee-Thomas and Democrat Tony Hill won their respective primaries.\nOther lawsuits.\nWillingham also filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Manning \"told a third party during a teleconference that Chris Willingham exchanged marijuana for sexually explicit images of children from a man who had been arrested on child sex abuse image charges\".\nIn December 2020, Travienna Edd's son filed a lawsuit against the McCurtain County jail trust alleging jail employees neglected his mother's health needs after she died in her jail cell from \"lung cancer, with heart disease, dehydration, and diabetes as contributing factors\u201d. The county responded that her \"death was the result of natural causes and her own refusal to accept medical treatment and/or participate in her own health care\".\nIn June 2022, former jail inmate Roper Harris alleged in a federal civil rights lawsuit that Clardy and deputies used excessive force while arresting him by pushing him down a flight of stairs and forcing onto the pavement on his face; the suit also alleged that jail employees purposely put him in a cell with violent offenders who beat him and then denied him medical care in September 2021.\nOn April 20, 2023, the widow of Bobby Dale Barrick, a Tulsa man who had died in McCurtain County custody, filed suit in federal court against the Board of County Commissioners, Sheriff Clardy, three McCurtain County deputies, and a game warden. The lawsuit claims the county sheriff officers turned their body cameras off before beating and tasing Barrick, resulting in his hospitalization and death.", "__index_level_0__": 9727, "length": 1110, "pred": {"ppl": 5.527592659, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -0.9894283344, "ppl/zlib": 0.000559474, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.2636608813, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.9735460069, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.5237501896, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.5585452604, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.8258203235, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.2643819339, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.8101219415}, "question": "Who called for the resignation of McCurtain County officials involved in the audio recording scandal?", "answer": "Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt", "prediction": "Question: Who called for the resignation of McCurtain County officials involved in the audio recording scandal?\nAnswer: Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt", "generated_answer": "Neal McCoy\n\nQ: In"}

{"id": 72163546, "context": "James Mercer (baptised 1734 \u2013 1804) was a Scottish soldier and poet. He is now best known as the friend of the abolitionist poet James Beattie.\nEarly life.\nHe was the eldest son of Thomas Mercer, of a cadet line of the Mercer family of Aldie, Perthshire, and was born in Aberdeen on 27 February 1734; Hugh Mercer and Captain William Mercer of the Bengal Army were cousins. He was educated at Aberdeen High School, and then at Marischal College, where he graduated M.A. in 1754.\nSoldier.\nMercer went to Paris, where his Jacobite father was then living. After his father's death in 1756, He joined a British regiment, and served in the Seven Years' War. He was under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick through its early campaigns, and in 1759 fought at the battle of Minden. He was in 1761 presented by General David Graeme with a company in the newly-raised 105th Foot, but the corps was reduced on the peace and Treaty of Paris of 1763.\nShortly afterwards Mercer purchased a company in the 49th Foot, and served for several years in Ireland. He was on good terms with Michael Cox, archbishop of Cashel; but he declined Cox's invitation to take holy orders and accept a living in his gift. In 1770 he purchased a majority in his regiment.\nIn 1772, however, Mercer had a professional disappointment: he was not given the succession to the lieutenant-colonelcy of Sir Henry Calder, 4th Baronet, which he had expected. He sold out of the army. It was 1790 before Calder moved, promoted to command of the 30th Foot.\nLater life.\nMercer settled in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen, and cultivated the friendship of James Beattie. They had been at college together, and Robinson considers that they were probably on good terms from the early 1760s. He travelled for his health, mainly in the south of France.\nIn 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, Mercer accepted the militia rank of major from Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, in the Duke's unit of fencibles. At Glasgow, where the regiment was stationed, he associated with Thomas Reid and Sir William Forbes, as well as with the duke and duchess. Forbes was also in Beattie's literary circle, and the two exchanged light verse concerning him. Reid was a friend from his time at King's College, Aberdeen, when Mercer was at Marischal College, and his future wife Katherine was on good terms with Reid's three daughters.\nIn 1799 Beattie appointed Mercer one of his executors, together with a friend they had in common, Robert Arbuthnot of Haddo (1729\u20131803); Beattie himself died in 1803. Mercer settled at Sunny Bank, near Aberdeen, where he died on 27 November 1804.\nWorks.\nAt Marischal College Mercer had his literary taste shaped by the classical scholar Thomas Blackwell. He wrote poems influenced by Horace, as well as those owing something to his friend James Beattie.\nAn anonymous \"Lyric Poems\" was published in 1797, by Mercer's brother-in-law Lord Glenbervie, A second edition appeared in 1804, under Mercer's name, and the third edition was published posthumously in 1806, as \"Lyric Poems by the late James Mercer, with an Account of the Life of the Author by Lord Glenbervie\", London. It received fulsome praise in the \"Edinburgh Review\" (January 1807) and from Sir James Mackintosh, who described the poems as \"everywhere elegant and sometimes charming\". Egerton Brydges quoted the \"Ode to Novelty\" in his \"Censura\".\nFamily.\nMercer married, on 13 September 1763, Katherine Douglas, a beauty, and sister of Sylvester Douglas, Lord Glenbervie.

The sea itself is claimed by China under its nine-dash map line claim.\nSecond Thomas Shoal is occupied by the Philippines, which intentionally grounded the Philippine Navy ship on the shoal in 1999.\nIncident.\nOn August 5, 2023, the Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine Navy were heading to the Second Thomas Shoal to conduct what it describes as a routine resupply mission for personnel aboard the marooned at the feature. The mission involved two wooden boats of the Philippine Navy; \"Unaizah May 1\" (UM1) and \"Unaizah May 2\" escorted by the Coast Guard's and . The Navy purposely uses civilian-type ships for the resupply to avoid sending a \"wrong message\" that the mission is of military nature.\nThe China Coast Guard (CCG) has impended the Philippine ships. UM1 was able to provide provisions for Filipino personnel aboard \"Sierra Madre\" after successfully outmaneuvering a CCG ship. UM2 was deterred by another CCG ship which fired water cannons towards it. The CCG were allegedly backed by Chinese maritime militia vessels.\nChina claims that the Philippines is sending construction materials to reinforce \"Sierra Madre\", an activity which it considers as illegal.\nReactions.\nChina Foreign Ministry.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged the Philippines to work with China to resolve the South China Sea dispute in response to the Second Thomas Shoal incident. The Chinese foreign ministry has also dissuaded the United States from interfering in the territorial dispute.\nInternational.\nThe United States reaffirmed its commitment to its alliance with the Philippines in response to the incident. Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union also issued statements condemning China.\nAftermath.\nClaims against Filipino diplomats.\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs supposedly issued a memorandum ordering the recall of Jose Manuel Romualdez, Ambassador of the Philippines to the United States due to bribery and corruption allegations from an anonymous complaint. Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo denied such order exists and Romualdez claimed that China is launching a smear campaign to damage Philippine\u2013United States relations.\nAlleged Philippine promise.\nOn August 8, 2023, China brought up an alleged explicit promise made by the Philippines to remove \"Sierra Madre\" from the Second Thomas Shoal.\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) of the Philippines insists that the grounded ship shall remain a \"permanent station\". On August 9, President Bongbong Marcos issued a statement that he is \"not aware of any such arrangement or agreement\" while adding that if such exist, that he rescind such agreement.\nIn response to request to show proof of such agreement, China said that there is no point in doing so following the rescission.\nOn August 14, 2023, \"Manila Times\" columnist Rigoberto Tiglao claimed that the alleged pledge was indeed made albeit \"solely verbal\". Tiglao wrote that such pledge was referenced in several documents including confidential official memoranda from the DFA.\nSenators Jinggoy Estrada and JV Ejercito said that there was no such deal made during the administration of their father Joseph Estrada. The former had prior recent correspondence with Orly Mercado who was the Defense Secretary during the Estrada presidency. He also pointed out that the promise is \"illogical\" given that President Estrada himself instructed the Armed Forces of the Philippines to ground \"Sierra Madre\" as a move for the Philippines to assert its claim over the feature. He challenged China to name the specific Filipino official who made the supposed pledge.\nFormer President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo also categorically denied making any such promise during her administration.\nThe National Security Council insist that China is using \"political operators\" to undermine the Philippine's position on the South China Sea dispute, naming the alleged promise as one of China's methods of \"psychological warfare\" to sway Filipino public opinion on the matter.\nVietnam.\nThree Filipino critics on China's territorial claims were supposedly requested in July to publish material against Vietnam regarding the Southeast Asian country's alleged militarization of the South China Sea. The three are Jay Batongbacal (UP Institute of Maritime Affairs and the Law of the Sea head), Antonio Carpio (Retired Supreme Court Justice), and Renato De Castro (De La Salle University international studies professor).

When Bernard Kouchner, the representative of the UN mission in Kosovo, arrested Xhavit Hasani, Sulejmani launched an operation against Macedonian troops. As a result of this operation, four Macedonian soldiers were taken captive by Sulejmani. Subsequently, a prisoner exchange took place, with the four kidnapped soldiers being swapped for Xhavit Hasani. He also participated in the Battle of Slupcane, where he served as a commander alongside Beqir Sadiku. On 2 February 2018, he passed away in his hometown of Ara\u010dinovo due to a cardiac arrest.\nLegacy.\nSulejmani is celebrated as a National Hero by Albanians in North Macedonia.\nReferences.\n ", "__index_level_0__": 13098, "length": 250, "pred": {"ppl": 5.4912714958, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0751703685, "ppl/zlib": 0.0020227551, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.3774865541, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.0364840898, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.5445528572, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.5479258931, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.8002969155, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.2439914704, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.7929670083}, "question": "What was the nickname of Nazmi Sulejmani, the Albanian commander of the National Liberation Army during the insurgency in Macedonia in 2001?", "answer": "Komandant Arusha", "prediction": "Question: What was the nickname of Nazmi Sulejmani, the Albanian commander of the National Liberation Army during the insurgency in Macedonia in 2001?\nAnswer: Komandant Arusha", "generated_answer": "\"Vet\u00eblla me fituesi\""}
{"id": 72034379, "context": "Gloria Metzner (August 25, 1922 \u2013 March 18, 2023), better known by the stage name of Gloria Dea , was an American actress, dancer, artist, and magician. Dea is noted for being the first magician to have performed in Las Vegas, as well as appearing in films during the Golden Age of Hollywood.\nLife and career.\nEarly life and work as magician.\nGloria Metzner was born in Oakland, California, United States, on August 25, 1922, to Martha (n\u00e9e Heyman) and Leo Metzner. In World War I, Leo Metzner served in the 363rd Infantry Regiment of the 91st Division, then returned home to become a paint salesman and owner of a chain of paint stores. He had also performed as a magician in local circles under the stage name of \"The Great Leo\". \nGloria Metzner started performing tricks at the age of four, and by the age of seven was noted as being \"the youngest working magician in the world\". She specialized in the hat trick, from which she pulled her two pet guinea pigs and a pigeon. At the age of 11, she was one of the youngest members of the Pacific Coast Association of Magicians, and at age 12 won an award from the association for best work with livestock in competition. Metzner performed as a magician at El Rancho Vegas on May 14, 1941, making her the first magician to have performed on the Las Vegas Strip.\nFilm and art career.\nAs her career in show magic came to an end, she moved to Southern California and became an actress in Hollywood films from the mid-1940s to late 1950s, adopting the stage name Gloria Dea. For much of this time, Dea was contracted with Columbia Pictures. During the filming of 1944's \"Delightfully Dangerous\", in which Dea performed as a dancer, producer Charles R. Rogers paused filming for twenty minutes so that Dea could marry her fianc\u00e9, orchestra leader Jack Statham. The couple had been unable to marry previously due to time clashes with their work schedules. By March 1945, Dea and Statham had separated. Dea's second marriage was to Hal Borne, noted for being the rehearsal pianist of Fred Astaire. They were married in Los Angeles in April 1946. In 1952, Dea took on her most prominent role, playing the lead of native girl Princess Pha in the 1952 film \"King of the Congo\", in which she starred opposite Buster Crabbe. Her other film credits include \"Mexicana\" (1945) and \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1957).\nIn 1954, Dea represented the American Guild of Variety Artists as a founding board member of the San Fernando Labor Co-ordinating Council, a united San Fernando Valley area labor union group that predated the merger of the AFL-CIO. Credit for the Council's founding was given to Jack Shulem, from the International Typographical Union. By 1956, they had married, and she was using the name Gloria Dea Shulem while continuing on the Council board. \nThe couple lived in Burbank, California, in a house which Dea decorated with Greek gods which she drew using charcoal, oil paint, and gold leaf, and curtains that she had received national coverage for, decorated with drawings and glued-on beads. Besides labor and art, Dea was active in Burbank community organizations, being chair of the Hobby Show, and member of the Women's Council, B'nai Brith, Beautiful Committee, and Hadassah, often accompanying her mother. Dea was elected president of the Burbank Hadassah in 1957, and won a Women's Council service award in 1964.\nLater life.\nAfter leaving the entertainment industry, Dea sold insurance, and then new and used cars for a Chevrolet dealership in the San Fernando Valley. She later moved back to Las Vegas in 1980, residing in the Paradise Palms community with her husband, Sam Anzalone, a fellow auto dealer she met at the Chevrolet dealership. Anzalone died in January 2022, and Dea turned 100 in August. She celebrated the event at the Westgate Las Vegas with other magicians, including David Copperfield. Dea occasionally performed magic tricks at the assisted-living residence in Las Vegas where she lived.\nDea died from coronary artery disease at her Las Vegas residence on March 18, 2023, at age 100.", "__index_level_0__": 2410, "length": 687, "pred": {"ppl": 5.4606261253, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0194591451, "ppl/zlib": 0.000853047, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.4040206415, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.0105535345, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.4772420728, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.4875540662, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.7726871208, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.2215099854, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.7803332435}, "question": "What was Gloria Dea's stage name?", "answer": "Gloria Dea", "prediction": "Question: What was Gloria Dea's stage name?\nAnswer: Gloria Dea", "generated_answer": "Little Nellie Wetzel\n\nQ:"}
