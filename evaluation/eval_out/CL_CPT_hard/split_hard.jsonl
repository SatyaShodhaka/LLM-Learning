{"id": 73528639, "context": "Harley Quinn is an ongoing American comic book series featuring the DC Comics character Harley Quinn as its protagonist.\nPublication history.\nVolume 1.\nWhile pursuing new assignments at DC Comics' offices in New York City, Karl Kesel was approached by former DC editor Matt Idelson to create a pitch for Harley Quinn's first ongoing series, which Karl accepted, being a fan of the character after having read Dini's \"Mad Love\". Kesel chose Terry Dodson as the artist for the series, whose art Kesel thought complemented the character's cartoonish roots and worldview. Kesel called Dodson and asked him if he was interested on working on the comic, to which Dodson agreed, and the two worked for a month on their proposal for the series, which was to make a comic about \"love gone horribly, terribly wrong\". The proposal was accepted by DC Comics, and the pair began work on the series, with Kesel and Dodson both being involved in the storytelling, and Dodson bringing in his wife, Rachel Dodson, to ink. Kesel's run on the series began being published in December 2000, and was about Harley Quinn leaving the Joker and becoming a solo criminal, alongside a supporting cast of henchmen named the Quinntets. Because of underwhelming sales, his 25-issue run ended in December 2002, and DC decided to change the creative team; the series was given to writer A.J. Lieberman and artists Mike Huddleston and Troy Nixey by Idelson, and took on a grittier and darker direction, contrasting Kesel's run. The decision renewed interest in the character, but the sales remained lackluster and the series was cancelled in 2003.\nVolume 3.\nHarley Quinn's relaunched ongoing series is a direct continuation of the former, with Conner and Palmiotti still writing for the character, and Hardin and Timms illustrating the interior art. After having written 64 issues of Harley Quinn's ongoing series, Conner and Palmiotti's five-year run ended with the 34th issue of the series in December 2017, with writer Frank Tieri and artist Inaki Miranda taking over the title. Tieri's run on the series ended with the series' 42nd issue, followed by a two-issue storyline written by Christopher Sebela and illustrated by Mirka Andolfo. By issue #45 in July 2018, Sam Humphries was the new writer for the series, with John Timms returning to provide art.

{"id": 74381984, "context": "The Thornlie line is a suburban railway line and service in Perth, Western Australia, operated by the Public Transport Authority as part of the Transperth system. The Thornlie line is a branch of the Armadale line and runs for parallel to the Kwinana freight railway between the Armadale line at Kenwick and Thornlie station. Thornlie line services continue north of Kenwick along the Armadale line to Perth station, stopping at most stations, in contrast to Armadale line services, which skip most stations along that section.\nInitial plans for the Mandurah line had the line as a spur off the Armadale line along the Kwinana freight railway in the same manner as the present-day Thornlie line. This plan was changed in 2001, but not before tunnels were built for the line to exit the Armadale line at Kenwick and enter the Kwinana Freeway. It was decided to built the Thornlie line instead as a one station branch of the Armadale line. The main construction contract was awarded to Barclay Mowlem in 2004 and the Thornlie line opened on 7 August 2005.\nSince 2017, there have been plans to extend the Thornlie line to Cockburn Central station on the Mandurah line, known as the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link. Construction for this started in 2019 and the extension is planned to open in 2025.\nHistory.\nSpur to Thornlie.\nInitial plans for the Mandurah line had the line as a spur off the Armadale line along the Kwinana freight railway in the same manner as the present-day Thornlie line. As part of an extension of Roe Highway and realignment of Albany Highway in the late-1990s and early 2000s, it was decided to build the first stage of the Kenwick tunnel required for the Mandurah line to exit the Armadale line and pass under Albany Highway, Roe Highway and the freight railway, as it would have been disruptive to build the tunnel when the highway was already open. The Glen Iris tunnel in Jandakot was also constructed before the rest of the Mandurah line as part of an extension of the Kwinana Freeway in 2000. This tunnel is long and links the Kwinana Freeway median to the Kwinana freight railway right of way.\nThe Mandurah line was rerouted to follow a more direct route along the Kwinana Freeway to the Perth CBD following a change in government due to the 2001 state election. It was decided to build the Thornlie line though, as a one station branch of the Armadale line. New MetroRail was formed in 2003 as a division of the Public Transport Authority (PTA) to manage extensions to railways in Perth, including the Mandurah line, the Thornlie line, and an extension of the Joondalup line to Clarkson station. The second stage contract for the Kenwick tunnel was awarded to John Holland Group in March 2003 at a cost of $14.225 million. The second stage consisted of of tunnel, the realignment of of the Kwinana freight railway, and the construction of noise walls. The total tunnel length after the two stages was .\nAs part of the Thornlie line, a new traction substation at Beckenham was constructed to power the Thornlie line and provide backup power to the Armadale line, which was mainly powered by a substation at East Perth. The contract for that was awarded to Western Power Corporation in September 2003 at a cost of $3.3 million. Preliminary work for the Thornlie line involved relocating a BP oil pipeline which runs alongside the freight railway.\nAn invitation to tender was sent out on 25 June 2003. This was for the construction of Thornlie station, of single track railway, a rail bridge across the Canning River and a road bridge for Spencer Road across the Thornlie line and freight line to replace the existing level crossing there. It was estimated that Thornlie station would attract 3,500 daily boardings and open in December 2004. The tender was planned to close on 28 August 2003, but that was extended to 16 December 2003. Barclay Mowlem was announced as the preferred tenderer in February 2004 and was awarded the contract for the works by April 2004. The estimated value of the contract was $30 million. By then, the planned opening date was February 2005. Barclay Mowlem had begun construction by July 2004. Thornlie station and the Thornlie line were officially opened on 7 August 2005 by Premier Geoff Gallop, Planning and Infrastructure Minister Alannah MacTiernan, and member for Kenwick Sheila McHale. Full service began on 8 August 2005.\nThornlie\u2013Cockburn Link extension.\nAn extension of the Thornlie line to link up with the Mandurah line had been proposed several times in the 2010s. In December 2012, the Labor Party announced it planned to incorporate the Thornlie line into a loop line to link the proposed Airport line to the Fremantle line via the Armadale and Mandurah lines if it won the 2013 state election. This was part of its proposed Metronet plan to rapidly expand Perth's rail network. There would have been stations at Nicholson Road, Ranford Road and a station called South Lake at the intersection with the Mandurah line. The Liberal government's 2016 \"Transport @ 3.5 million\" plan called for an extension of the Thornlie line to Cockburn Central station on the Mandurah line by the time that Perth reaches a population of 2.7 million.\nAhead of the 2017 state election, both major parties committed to extending the Thornlie line to Cockburn Central station. The Liberal government said it could be done at a cost of $520 million and be open in late-2023, whereas Labor said it could be constructed for $474 million by 2021 as part of its revised Metronet plans. Labor won the 2017 election, and so planning for the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link began in late-March 2017.\nThe business case for the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link was submitted to Infrastructure Australia in August 2017. In November 2018, Infrastructure Australia released its assessment of the project, adding the project to the Infrastructure Priority List as a Priority Project and giving the project a project economic benefit of $969 million and a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 1.2. Options considered also included only extending the Thornlie line to Nicholson Road and having a station there, or only extending the line to Nicholson Road and having a station at Ranford Road and Nicholson Road, but extending the line the whole way to Cockburn was found to be the best choice. Infrastructure Australia recommended that the contract for the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link be combined with the contract for the Yanchep Rail Extension of the Joondalup line to save costs during procurement.\nScope.\nThe project definition plan, detailing the scope of the project, for the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link was approved by state cabinet in July 2018. The project was to involve the construction of two new stations: Nicholson Road and Ranford Road stations, each with two long island platforms, full disabled access, a bus interchange for feeder buses and a large car park. Nicholson Road station was forecast to have 2,350 boardings per day in 2031 and Ranford Road station was forecast to have 1,985 boardings per day in 2031. of new dual track railway was to be constructed between Thornlie and Cockburn Central, using the pre-existing Glen Iris tunnel to enter the median of the Kwinana Freeway. Most of this track was to be along the southern side of the freight railway, with the final located in the median of the Kwinana Freeway between the two Mandurah line tracks. of single track railway between Beckenham junction and Thornlie station was to be duplicated, including constructing a new bridge across the Canning River. The Kenwick tunnel was already designed for a double tracked railway. of the freight railway was to be relocated slightly north to make way for the Thornlie line.\nThornlie station was to have its platforms extended to and be converted to allow for through trains, including the construction of an overpass at Thornlie station. Cockburn Central station was to have a new platform extending north from the existing Mandurah line platforms for Thornlie line trains to terminate. The existing Ranford Road bridge was to be replaced as it was not long enough to fit both the freight and passenger tracks. The Karel Avenue bridge was to be expanded as well. A new footbridge at Elliot Place was to replace the existing pedestrian level crossing there. At this stage, construction was planned to begin in late-2019 and finish in 2021.\nFurther planning.\nA request for proposal was released in September 2018 for the design and construct contract for the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link and the Yanchep Rail Extension. Two consortia were shortlisted in April 2019. They were METROconnex, a joint venture between Coleman Rail, Clough, and Georgiou Group; and NEWest Alliance, a joint venture between CPB Contractors and Downer.\nIn May 2019, the budget for the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link increased to $536 million.\nIn November 2019, NEWest Alliance was announced as the preferred proponent to design and build the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link and the Yanchep Rail Extension. The following month, the contract for the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link and the Yanchep Rail Extension was awarded to NEWest Alliance. The value of the whole contract was $1.25 billion and the value of the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link portion was $716 million, an increase on the $474 million originally promised. $366 million was to be funded by the state government and $350 million funded by the federal government. The completion date was delayed by two years to 2023. The delay was blamed on having to relocate the BP oil pipeline and the Kwinana freight railway.\nThe Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link received state environmental approval from the Environmental Protection Authority in August 2019 and federal environmental approval from the Department of the Environment and Energy.\nConstruction.\nThe September 2021 state budget revealed that the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link's opening date would be delayed by a year to late-2024 due to a skills shortage and to ease pressure on Western Australia's construction industry.\nFrom 26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022, the Mandurah line was shut down between Elizabeth Quay station to Aubin Grove staiton to facilitate works on the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link. This was the longest planned shutdown of a railway line in Perth's history and was done so that the Mandurah line tracks between Cockburn Central station and the Glen Iris tunnel could be realigned to make way for the Thornlie line tracks in between.\nIn February 2022, it was announced that the Armadale and Thornlie lines would undergo an eighteen-month shutdown for the Victoria Park-Canning Level Crossing Removal Project along the Armadale line starting in early-2023. Works would be conducted for the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link during the shut down as well, such as duplication of the tracks between Beckenham junction and Thornlie station. In August 2022, the 18-month shutdown was delayed until late-2023, thereby delaying the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link as well to 2025. The specific date for the start of the shutdown has been announced as 20 November 2023. During the shutdown, replacement buses will run from Thornlie station to Murdoch station on the Mandurah line, a temporary bus station at Cannington station, and to Perth Busport along Albany Highway.\nFuture.\nThe Thornlie line will eventually form part of a southern loop line around Perth by a link from the Airport line to the Thornlie line and a link from the Thornlie line to the Fremantle line.\nDescription.\nThe Thornlie branch uses narrow gauge track and has a maximum speed of . Trains are powered by overhead line equipment which is powered by a substation in Beckenham. The Thornlie line branch is single-tracked except at Thornlie station, which has two tracks. The Thornlie line is the only section of the Transperth network that is single-tracked.\nThe Thornlie line uses fixed block signalling. As part of Metronet's High Capacity Signalling Project, the Transperth rail network will be upgraded to moving block signalling using communications-based train control (CBTC). As of 2021, the CBTC system is planned to be implemented on the Armadale and Thornlie lines by June 2031.\nStations.\nThe Thornlie line branch has one station; Thornlie line trains stop at 11 stations in total. All stations along the Thornlie line branch, including the future Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link stations, are fully accessible, whereas all but three stations along the Armadale line are not fully accessible. The three accessible stations are Claisebrook, Perth Stadium, and Victoria Park stations.\nThornlie station currently has a long platform, but it will be lengthened as part of the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link. All the new station platforms and the Cockburn Central station platform will be long, which are long enough for six car trains, the longest trains on the Transperth network. Train lengths will be limited by long platforms on the Armadale line. These platforms are planned to be lengthened eventually to allow for six car trains on the Thornlie line.\nService.\nTransperth train services are operated by the PTA's Transperth Train Operations division. Thornlie line trains operate every 15 minutes during the day on all days except Sunday, when they operate every 30 minutes instead. This makes the Thornlie line Transperth's least frequent line. At night, frequencies reduce to every half an hour, and every hour late at night. Thornlie line peak frequencies are forecast to remain the same until at least 2031, with capacity increases to be provided for by longer trains enabled by platform lengthening. Operating hours are from roughly 5:00 am to midnight. Thornlie line trains stop at every station along the Armadale line between Perth and Cannington stations, except for Perth Stadium station, which is typically only served by Armadale line trains. This contrasts with Armadale line trains, which typically skips most stations along that section, except McIver, Claisebrook, and Oats Street stations. Between Cannington and the Thornlie branch is Beckenham station, which is skipped by Thornlie line trains.\nRolling stock.\nThe Thornlie line is served primarily by Transperth A-series trains, with Transperth B-series trains occasionally used as well. By 2031, it is planned that all A-series trains will be retired, leaving the Thornlie line to be served primarily by B-series trains. The A-series trains were built between 1991 and 1999 and consist of two cars which are usually joined to form four car trains. Each car has two doors on each side. The B-series trains were built between 2004 and 2019, consist of three cars each and have two doors on the side of each car. These trains are all primarily stored at Claisebrook depot.\nPatronage.\nThornlie station had 578,199 boardings in the 2013\u201314 financial year. When the Thornlie\u2013Cockburn Link opens, the line is predicted to have 12,225 boardings per day, rising to 17,425 boardings per day in 2031.

From Crvena zvezda he moved to their rival Partizan. Then numerous titles followed. Already in 1998, he won the national cup, and the following year the championship of FR Yugoslavia. Two years later, with Partizan, he won the Cup again, and in 2002 and 2003, he became national champion twice in a row.\nIn 2004, he signed for Magdeburg, with whom he played in the semi-finals of the EHF Champions League. After Magdeburg, he returned to Serbian handball and signed for Vojvodina, with which he became the champion of Serbia and Montenegro in the 2004/05 season. In 2006, he played for Altea, but soon left the club and took a break in his handball career due to family problems. He returned to handball and signed for Vojvodina once again, with which he won the Serbian Cup in the 2010/11 season.\nIn May 2011, he announced that he was returning to Partizan for the 2011/12 season. Season 2011/12 was extremely successful for Partizan, with whom Mandi\u0107 won the Championship, Cup and Supercup of Serbia and participated in the group stage of the Champions League. After a great season in which he won three trophies, Mandic announced that he was retiring. In January 2014, he returned to handball and joined Partizan in the desire to help the club win the title. However, that season, Partizan did not manage to win the title, and Mandi\u0107 definitely decided to retire.\nInternational.\nMandi\u0107 played for the FR Yugoslavia national team at the 2003 World Championship in Portugal.

{"id": 73509279, "context": "Russell Van Gelder is an American clinician-scientist and a board-certified ophthalmologist. He is most known for his work in the mechanisms of uveitis disease, his research on non-visual photoreception in the eye, and on vision-restoration methods for retinal degenerative disease.\nPersonal life.\nVan Gelder was born and raised near New York City. He lives with his wife, Suzy, on Mercer Island. In his free time, he enjoys skiing and hiking in the Pacific Northwest.\nEducation.\nVan Gelder graduated from Northern Valley Regional High School at Old Tappan in New Jersey in 1981. He then attended Stanford University, where he completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in Biological Sciences in 1985, and his MD and Ph.D. in Neurosciences in 1994, where he studied the molecular basis for circadian rhythms. He then completed an internal medicine internship at Stanford before coming to Washington University in St. Louis/Barnes-Jewish Hospital in 1995, where he was a resident in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. Here, Van Gelder also completed his Uveitis and Medical Retina fellowship in 1999, where he studied inflammation of the eye.\nCareer.\nVan Gelder joined the Washington University in St. Louis faculty full-time as an assistant professor in 1999. A year later, he also became an adjunct assistant professor of molecular biology and pharmacology. He was named Bernard Becker Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences in 2006. Van Gelder remained at Washington University until he moved to the University of Washington in 2007, where he has been involved in research on non-visual photoreception and pathogen detection in uveitis in the Van Gelder Lab.\nCurrently, he is the Boyd K. Bucey Memorial Endowed Chair of Ophthalmology, Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology, and Director of the Roger and Angie Karalis Johnson Retina Center at the University of Washington.\nResearch.\nThe Van Gelder Lab, funded continuously since 1999 by the National Institutes of Health, is developing photochemical methods to treat blindness and discover microorganisms associated with various eye diseases, such as ocular infectious diseases, including microbial keratitis, conjunctivitis, and Endophthalmitis, which are a significant cause of blinding diseases. Using techniques such as deep sequencing and other molecular methods, the Van Gelder lab analyzes the host microbiome and analyzes pathologic strains of viruses and bacteria causing inflammatory eye disease. The Van Gelder lab is investigating synthetic small molecule switches as a therapeutic for degenerative blinding diseases (such as age-related macular degeneration, which is caused by death of rods and cones). The Van Gelder lab is also working to understand mammalian circadian rhythms and studies mouse models to understand clock synchronization using light, cell-level research of light perception, and issues related to seasonal affective disorder.\nVan Gelder has been published in several high-impact peer-reviewed scientific journals, including \"Science\", \"Neuron\", \"Nature Genetics\", and \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\". Thus far, he has published over 200 different academic papers and book chapters.\nAmplified RNA.\nDr. Van Gelder's 1990 PNAS paper is one of his most influential and highly cited contribution to the fields of neuroscience and recombinant DNA technology. Prior to the publication of this paper, the cloning and analysis of low-abundance mRNAs in the brain was exceedingly difficult. However, with the help of his team, Van Gelder created a technique called antisense RNA amplification that was able to generate amplified RNA populations from limited amounts of cDNA in order to obtain ample amounts of nucleic acid needed for standard cloning techniques. Eventually, Van Gelder and his coauthors were granted a patent for this amplification technique in 2006.\nThis technique, developed based on a polymerase chain reaction, used a synthetic oligonucleotide primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. This was able to generate large quantities (up to 80-fold) of amplified antisense RNA (aRNA) from significantly smaller samples of cDNA. This technique has been widely used in many molecular biology labs. Since its development, further applications of aRNA amplification have been devised, some of which include protein detection, whole-genome DNA amplification, and DNA microarray.\nIntrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells.\nIn a 2005 Cell Press paper, Dr. Van Gelder found that intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which are responsible for mediating non-visual processes such as entrainment, are the first light-sensitive cells in the retina. Using a micro-electrode array in the ipRGCs of murine mice, Dr. Van Gelder found that there are three distinct cell populations in the postnatal day 8 (P8) retina, varying in their speed of onset, offset, and sensitivity. Further investigation found that even the postnatal day 0 retina displayed some intrinsic light response, with increased photosensitivity around day 6. These findings suggest that ipRGCs are the first photosensitive cells in the development of the retina.\nNeuropsin-Mediated Photoentrainment.\nIn a 2015 PNAS paper, Dr. Van Gelder found that Opsin-5 is sufficient for the entrainment of the molecular circadian clock in the mammalian retina. Entrainment to light in the mammalian retina is independent of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and does not require rods, cones, or melanopsin. While the short-wavelength sensitive cone pigments OPN1SW and OPN3 are not required for entrainment, Dr. Van Gelder found that retinas that lack OPN5, which are expressed in select retinal ganglion cells, are unable to entrain even though these cells still maintain normal visual functions. Additionally, Dr. Van Gelder found that OPN5 was sufficient in entraining the circadian rhythms of mice cornea ex-vivo, ascertaining the function of OPN5, which until then was classified as an orphan opsin.\nDetection and Treatment of Uveitis.\nDr. Van Gelder has worked extensively on the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive imaging technique that uses low-coherence light to capture micrometer resolution images. Dr. Van Gelder's work in this field has included the use of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which involves the use of a line-scan camera, instead of a spectrometer as is conventionally used in OCT. This allows for faster and higher resolution imaging . Dr. Van Gelder has used SD-OCT to image the inflammation associated with uveitis in rat models , as well as other macular degeneration.\nMemberships.\nVan Gelder currently serves on the Council of Councils to the National Institutes of Health. He was appointed as Editor-in-Chief for the flagship journal \"Ophthalmology\", the most widely read ophthalmology clinical publication, by the American Academy of Ophthalmology in February 2022.\nVan Gelder was the former president of several organizations such as the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), the American Uveitis Society, and the Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology. He previously served as Chair of the AAO Council and as the keynote Jackson Memorial Lecturer at the 2021 Annual AAO Meeting.\u00a0\nAwards and certifications.\nVan Gelder is the recipient of numerous awards for his research including:", "__index_level_0__": 9369, "length": 1079, "pred": {"ppl": 4.5895094872, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0188220529, "ppl/zlib": 0.0004815971, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.0682194639, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.7105077738, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.1397651324, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.174527672, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.4833753998, "Min_50.0% Prob": 2.9453779246, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.5166011241}, "question": "What is Dr. Russell Van Gelder's current position at the University of Washington?", "answer": "Boyd K.

She was deputy chief whip in the legislature until 2002, when she was demoted after her husband made disparaging comments about the IFP in the media.\nIn early March 2003, the IFP announced a reshuffle of its legislative caucus that would see Millin and two other provincial legislators move to seats in the National Assembly. While the party said that its aim was to reinforce its administrative capacity ahead of the 2004 general election, it was widely assumed that its immediate motive was to protect its plurality in the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature by removing legislators who were suspected of planning to cross the floor. Millin, in particular, was suspected of planning to join the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP).\nIndeed, when the 2003 floor-crossing window opened in late March, Millin announced her resignation from the IFP.

{"id": 73487604, "context": "Virgil Kersh Meroney II (February 16, 1921 \u2013 June 27, 1980) was a United States Air Force colonel. During World War II, he became a flying ace credited with nine aerial victories while flying the P-47 Thunderbolt, making him the only P-47 ace in the 352nd Fighter Group. He himself was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war before his successful escape from captivity. He also flew missions during the Korean War and Vietnam War before he retired from the air force in 1970.\nEarly life.\nOn February 16, 1921, Meroney was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.\nMilitary career.\nIn May 1937, he joined the Arkansas National Guard and was called to active duty in May 1940. In 1941, he married Mildred Louise, n\u00e9e Duckett (1921\u20132009). The couple had two sons: Virgil III and Douglas.\nOn March 27, 1942, he entered the flight training program of the United States Army Air Forces and earned his pilot wings. On October 30, 1942, he earned his commission as second lieutenant at Luke Field in Arizona.\nWorld War II.\nIn December 1942, Meroney was sent to Westover Field in Massachusetts where he was assigned to the 487th Fighter Squadron within the 352nd Fighter Group and in January 1943, he completed training in the P-47 Thunderbolt. In June 1943, the 352nd FG landed in the United Kingdom, and was assigned to RAF Bodney in Watton, Norfolk. Flying P-47s in combat, Meroney downed his first German plane and shared another aerial victory with a fellow fighter pilot on December 1, 1943.\nMeroney scored his second aerial victory on December 4, 1943, along with a shared aerial victory. He shot down his fourth German plane on January 29, 1944, and on January 30, he shot down his fifth German plane, becoming the first flying ace in the 352nd Fighter Group.\nMeroney continued to raise his aerial victory score. On March 8, while escorting American bombers withdrawing after the bombing mission over Berlin, Meroney's flight engaged three Bf-109s led by German flying ace Klaus Mietusch that was attempting to attack the bombers. As Mietusch attacked the bombers from the rear, he managed to shoot down one of the B-17s but in return was shot down by Meroney, forcing Mietusch to bail out of his aircraft, and thus crediting Meroney with his eighth aerial victory. On March 16, he shot down his ninth German plane, which would be his last aerial victory of the war. In April 1944, the 352nd FG converted to the P-51 Mustang. On April 8, 1944, while strafing a German airfield, Meroney was shot down by anti-aircraft fire and he bailed out of his crippled P-51. He was captured by the Germans and was held as a prisoner of war until April 1945, when he escaped captivity and managed to reach American forces advancing towards the Rhine.\nDuring World War II, Meroney was credited in destroying nine enemy aircraft plus two shared and one damaged. For his aerial exploits during the war, he was awarded the Silver Star, five Distinguished Flying Crosses and four Air Medals. While serving with the 352nd FG, his P-47 was named after his wife, bearing the name \"Sweet Louise\".\nCold War.\nFollowing his return to the U.S., from August 1945 to January 1946 Meroney was a flying instructor at Luke Field and continued to serve in the newly created United States Air Force. From 1950, he commanded the 561st Fighter Escort Squadron of the 12th Fighter Escort Group and led the unit to England from July to December 1951. He was later assigned to the 1211th Test Squadron in the Kwajalein Atoll from September to November 1952, where he took part in sampling missions in the aftermath of the Operation Ivy nuclear tests.\nFrom May to August 1953, he was assigned to Japan where he flew F-84 Thunderjets in combat during the last months of the Korean War. Meroney served in a variety of command and staff positions over the next 15 years. In 1968, during the Vietnam War, he was assigned to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base where he served as Deputy Commander for Operations and later as Vice Commander, and flew F-4 Phantom II in combat missions. He flew 141 combat missions and managed to fly at least two combat missions with his son Virgil III, before his son was killed in action on March 1, 1969, after his aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire during a nighttime strike mission against enemy targets in Khammouan province, Laos.\nMeroney returned to the United States in February 1969 and was assigned to the Headquarters Tactical Air Command at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, where he served as Assistant Chief of Safety and later as Chief of Safety before retiring from the air force on December 31, 1970.\nLater life.\nMeroney died of cancer on June 27, 1980, at the age of 59.

{"id": 72497597, "context": "Vice-Admiral Philip Wodehouse (16 July 1773 \u2013 21 January 1838) was a Royal Navy officer. A son of John Wodehouse, 1st Baron Wodehouse, he joined the navy some time before 1794. In 1796 he was promoted to commander and then captain, commanding sloops and frigates in the Mediterranean Fleet. Wodehouse cycled through a series of frigate commands towards the end of the French Revolutionary Wars, including HMS \"Mignonne\" which he had to burn as useless in 1797. In 1803, while commanding HMS \"Resistance\", his ship was wrecked off Cape St Vincent. Wodehouse subsequently commanded several ships of the line, including HMS \"Cumberland\" in the Mediterranean where in 1809 he fought at the Battle of Maguelone. Wodehouse was appointed Resident Commissioner, Halifax, in 1811 and served there until the dockyard was closed in 1819. He was promoted to rear-admiral later in the year. Wodehouse saw no further active service, but was promoted to vice-admiral in 1830.\nNaval career.\nPhilip Wodehouse was born on 16 July 1773. He was the second of four sons of Sir John Wodehouse, 6th Baronet, who would go on to be created Baron Wodehouse in 1797, and Sophia n\u00e9e Berkeley, a relative of the Earls of Berkeley. At some point early in his life Wodehouse began a career in the Royal Navy.\nFrench Revolutionary Wars.\nThe first recorded service of Wodehouse in the Royal Navy is his promotion to lieutenant on 6 January 1794, after which he served in the Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis. Early in 1796 Wodehouse was promoted to commander and given command of the 16-gun sloop HMS \"Albacore\" on the Downs Station. Soon afterwards he was selected to move to the command of a ship of the same type, HMS \"Peterel\", in the Mediterranean, to supersede her current commander, Commander Bartholomew James.\n\"Peterel\" was serving in Captain Horatio Nelson's squadron off Genoa, and Wodehouse spent four months chasing \"Peterel\" around the Mediterranean before he was able to catch up with her and take over from James in November. On 23 December Wodehouse was promoted to captain in the 28-gun frigate HMS \"Aurora\", still in the Mediterranean, after her previous commander drowned. He stayed in \"Aurora\" only very briefly, moving to the 32-gun frigate HMS \"Mignonne\", also stationed in the Mediterranean, later in December. \"Mignonne\" was an ex-French ship that had been captured by the British at the Siege of Toulon in 1793, and she was found to be so decrepit that Wodehouse was forced to burn her as useless at Portoferraio on 31 July 1797.\nWodehouse was next given command of the 24-gun frigate HMS \"Volage\", a recently captured French privateer, in October 1798. He sailed \"Volage\" to join the Leeward Islands Station in March 1799, based at Jamaica. He relinquished command in around September. Wodehouse did not receive a new command until April 1801 when he joined the 28-gun frigate HMS \"Brilliant\"; Wodehouse then moved to the 32-gun frigate HMS \"Iris\" in September. He commanded \"Iris\" only briefly, with his position in command being taken by a lieutenant some time before the end of the year. Wodehouse was then given command of the 36-gun frigate HMS \"Resistance\" in May 1802. \"Resistance\" was stationed off Weymouth for the summer, attending to the visiting George III. In the following year \"Resistance\" was ordered out to the Mediterranean; early in the morning of 31 May the ship was wrecked on the Portuguese coast near Cape St Vincent after striking rocks. Wodehouse and the crew were rescued.\nNapoleonic Wars.\nNow without a ship, in spring 1804 Wodehouse was instead appointed to superintend the Sea Fencibles, a coastal defence force, at Harwich. He continued in that post until August 1805, at which point he was given command of the 64-gun ship of the line HMS \"Intrepid\" which had recently completed a refit at Deptford Dockyard. Wodehouse took \"Intrepid\" out to the Mediterranean, where in June 1806 she formed part of Rear-Admiral Sidney Smith's squadron supporting the defence against the French invasion of Naples. Towards the end of 1807 Wodehouse again moved commands, commissioning the brand new 74-gun ship of the line HMS \"Cumberland\" in October. \"Cumberland\" sailed to join Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood's Mediterranean Fleet on 30 January 1808. By February 1809 Wodehouse's ship was serving in a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan, who commanded the Rochefort blockade.\nHaving returned to the Mediterranean, on 21 October \"Cumberland\" was serving under Collingwood blockading Toulon when Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Baudin escaped that port with a squadron including three ships of the line. Baudin was attempting to escort supplies and reinforcements to relieve Barcelona. He was discovered by the British on 23 October and Collingwood ordered Rear-Admiral George Martin to chase the French squadron with eight of the best sailing ships in the fleet, which included \"Cumberland\". At 3 p.m. Baudin split his warships away from the convoy and sailed towards the French coast. Martin and six of his ships, including \"Cumberland\", discovered Baudin and four of his ships early in the morning on 24 October. The British chased Baudin through the day but had to stop when night began to fall as they were dangerously close to the coastline. They made contact with the French again on the following day; two of the ships succeeded in getting into the harbour at Cette, but at 11:45 a.m. the 80-gun ship of the line \"Robuste\" and 74-gun ship of the line \"Lion\" ran ashore at Frontignan. The French set the ships on fire and in the night of 26 October they both exploded.\nMartin's squadron afterwards returned to Collingwood, who later in the month discovered that the convoy escorted by Baudin was in Rosas Bay. Captain Benjamin Hallowell was sent to capture or destroy the convoy, for which purpose he was given a squadron including \"Cumberland\". In the night of 31 October \"Cumberland\" and the larger vessels of the squadron anchored off the bay and sent their small boats in with the squadron's brigs. The French force was defended by several small warships and was covered by soldiers on the beach and forts above it, but by daylight on 1 November all the ships had been either captured or destroyed. The British lost fifteen men killed and a further fifty wounded, of which the latter included three officers from \"Cumberland\". Subsequently \"Cumberland\" was stationed off Sicily as part of the force protecting that island. Wodehouse continued with \"Cumberland\" in the Mediterranean until July 1811 when, having at some point been wounded, he handed over to Captain Robert Otway and withdrew from sea-service.\nCommissioner at Halifax.\nWodehouse was subsequently appointed Resident Commissioner, Halifax on 9 September 1811. This position, the senior-most of the Navy Board in Halifax, gave Wodehouse control over the Royal Naval Dockyard there; he was in command of all financial, administrative, building, and repair work relating to it. With the War of 1812 having begun, he oversaw a great expansion of the dockyard facilities which by 1814 were servicing 120 Royal Navy warships.\nIn around July 1813 Wodehouse was caught up in a dispute between the naval hospital's surgeon David Rowlands and the dispenser Robert Hume. Rowlands, having attempted to bully and coerce Hume, demanded a board of inquiry to investigate the latter's conduct. At the inquiry Rowlands also accused Wodehouse of being \"violently his enemy\". The court was unimpressed with this and subsequently abandoned the inquiry. Wodehouse then requested a second inquiry be held to investigate the running of the naval hospital. In this Rowlands accused Wodehouse of \"gross neglect of duty\", for which the former later apologised in January 1814. The court found against Rowlands but he continued at Halifax for another six years.\nBy 1815 both the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars had ended. Wodehouse began a campaign to convince the Navy Board to release funds to him for repairs, arguing that most of the dockyard was \"in the most defective state\". Very few repairs were sanctioned by the Navy Board during Wodehouse's tenure, and in March 1819 he was still bargaining with it, suggesting that the repairs could be done gradually to save money. In November 1815 Wodehouse supervised the start of the construction of Admiralty House for the use of the commanders-in-chief of the North America Station. The house was completed in 1819.\nThe Navy Board decided in May the same year to close the dockyard and use its remaining facilities as a supply depot, it being surplus to peacetime requirements. This signalled the end of Wodehouse's tenure at Halifax and soon after transport was arranged for him and his family to return to Britain. Described by the historian Julian Gwyn as \"intelligent, warm, and kind-hearted\", with the closing Wodehouse received testimonials of affection from Halifax town, Nova Scotia Council, and his dockyard officers and clerks. With most of his workers becoming unemployed when the yard closed, Wodehouse lobbied successfully to secure their pensions and for those who lived on site to continue to do so.\nThe historian Harry Piers suggests that while at Halifax Wodehouse had his portrait painted by Robert Field, but as of 1927 no such portrait had been located. Having left Halifax, on 12 August 1819 Wodehouse was promoted to rear-admiral. He had no further active service within the Royal Navy after this, but was promoted to vice-admiral on 22 July 1830. He died on 21 January 1838.\nPersonal life.\nWhile serving at Halifax Wodehouse married Mary Hay Cameron, the second daughter of Charles Cameron, Governor of the Bahamas, on 7 May 1814. Together the couple had seven children:", "__index_level_0__": 4567, "length": 1573, "pred": {"ppl": 4.6810598373, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0018030514, "ppl/zlib": 0.0003909637, "Min_5.0% Prob": 7.7772180264, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.4678787818, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.0282013723, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.1332645703, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.4717605292, "Min_50.0% Prob": 2.9573841835, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.5418954527}, "question": "What was Philip Wodehouse's highest rank in the Royal Navy?", "answer": "Vice-Admiral", "prediction": "Question: What was Philip Wodehouse's highest rank in the Royal Navy?\nAnswer: Vice-Admiral", "generated_answer": "Vice Admiral \nQ: Name the former"}

He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen. He was with the 30th Bengal Native Infantry at Aliwal, and acted as brigadier of the force sent against Kangra, in 1846, during the First Sikh War. He commanded his battalion in the Second Sikh War; was promoted colonel in 1854, and brigadier in 1857. He was treacherously shot and killed during the Cawnpore massacre in June 1857.\nOrigins.\nAlexander Jack was a grandson of William Jack, the minister of Northmavine, Shetland. His father, the Rev. William Jack (died 9 February 1854) (M.D., Edinburgh), was sub-principal of University and King's colleges, Aberdeen, from 1800 to 1815, and principal from 1815 to 1854.

The march was said 'to reflect everlasting credit on the Bengal artillery'. Some views of the place taken by Jack were published under the title \"Six Sketches of Kot-Kangra, drawn on the spot\" (London, 1847, fol.).\nSecond Sikh War.\nJack was in command of his battalion in the Second Sikh War, including the battles of Chillianwalla and Goojerat (medal and clasps and C.B.). He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the 34th Bengal Native infantry on 18 December 1851.

Wheeler maintained his position in an entrenched camp until 27 June, when an attempted evacuation was made in accordance with an arrangement entered into with Nana Sahib. After the troops had embarked in boats for Allahabad, the mutineers treacherously shot down Jack and all the Englishmen except four.

The theme first appears in the beginning credits of the first film in the \"Prologue\" track, a shortened version of the full five-minute theme, which itself is not featured until the end credits of the first film.\nSince being featured in the original soundtrack, the piece's main theme has been further developed by Williams for the second and third films, and by Patrick Doyle, Nicholas Hooper, and Alexandre Desplat for the following five films. The theme has also been featured in James Newton Howard's title tracks for the spin-off \"Fantastic Beasts\" films, as well as in various video games based on the franchise, including \"Hogwarts Legacy\", and throughout The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal theme parks. Having been heavily featured in the Harry Potter franchise, \"Hedwig's Theme\" is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most iconic film themes of all time.\nBackground.\nWarner Bros. and Christopher Columbus, director of the first film, initially wanted to get an idea of which composer was best suited to compose the film's score by giving different composers the task of creating a theme for a promotional short for the film. Williams, without having seen any footage from the film, composed the first draft of Hedwig's Theme for the short, which he presented to Columbus on piano.\nComposition.\nThe piece in its entirety is in ternary form. The first section is the most recognizable and is built around the titular Hedwig's Theme, which John Williams uses as a leitmotif to represent the magical world. The second section is built around the faster \"Nimbus\" theme, which Williams uses as a leitmotif to represent Harry's broomstick, the Nimbus 2000, and more generally, to represent fast-paced mischief and adventure. The third section restates part of the Hedwig's theme in a more intense manner than it was originally stated before leading into a coda that primarily uses material not already introduced in the piece.", "__index_level_0__": 14781, "length": 354, "pred": {"ppl": 4.6385440826, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0129622826, "ppl/zlib": 0.0014940609, "Min_5.0% Prob": 7.6182290774, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.3350907182, "Min_20.0% Prob": 4.9370148249, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.0491291442, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.4020393345, "Min_50.0% Prob": 2.8901086922, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.499641701}, "question": "What is the main theme used in the \"Harry Potter\" film series?", "answer": "Hedwig's Theme", "prediction": "Question: What is the main theme used in the \"Harry Potter\" film series?\nAnswer: Hedwig's Theme", "generated_answer": "leitmotif\n\nQ: When were"}

It is an erect shrub with egg-shaped leaves arranged more or less in opposite pairs, and head-like clusters of white or cream-coloured, tube-shaped flowers.\nDescription.\n\"Pimelea holroydii\" is an erect shrub that usually grows to a height of and has a single stem at ground level. The leaves are arranged more or less in opposite pairs, egg-shaped to broadly egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in heads on a peduncle usually long, the flowers surrounded by 4 to 7 egg-shaped to broadly egg-shaped, green involucral bracts long and wide. As the flowers develop, the heads become more elongated. The flowers are usually white, sometimes cream-coloured, each flower on a pedicel long. The floral tube is long and densely hairy, the sepals long. Flowering occurs in January and February and from August to October.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Pimelea holroydii\" was first formally described in 1868 by Ferdinand von Mueller in \"Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae\" from specimens collected by Charles Harper in the Hamersley Range. The specific epithet (\"holroydii\") honours Arthur Holroyd.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThis pimelea grows on red, clayey soil from the Hamersley Range to Mount James Station in the Gascoyne, Murchison and Pilbara bioregions of northern Western Australia.\nConservation status.\n\"Pimelea holroydii\" is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.", "__index_level_0__": 5322, "length": 236, "pred": {"ppl": 3.2240524292, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0328084417, "ppl/zlib": 0.0015505153, "Min_5.0% Prob": 7.1269834382, "Min_10.0% Prob": 5.7793815987, "Min_20.0% Prob": 4.3366656758, "Min_30.0% Prob": 3.4311051246, "Min_40.0% Prob": 2.7894799261, "Min_50.0% Prob": 2.3114319955, "Min_60.0% Prob": 1.9490495179}, "question": "What is the conservation status of Pimelea holroydii according to the Government of Western Australia?", "answer": "\"not threatened\"", "prediction": "Question: What is the conservation status of Pimelea holroydii according to the Government of Western Australia?\nAnswer: \"not threatened\"", "generated_answer": "Threatened\n\nQ: In the"}
{"id": 72394363, "context": "Patagopelta (meaning \"Patagonian shield\") is an extinct genus of nodosaurine dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous (upper Campanian\u2013lower Maastrichtian) Allen Formation of Argentina. The genus contains a single species, P. cristata, known from a partial skeleton. \"Patagopelta\" is a very small ankylosaur, comparable in size to the dwarf nodosaurid \"Struthiosaurus\", about long.\nDiscovery and naming.\nThe \"Patagopelta\" fossil material was found in sediments of the Allen Formation (Salitral Moreno locality) near General Roca, R\u00edo Negro Province, Argentina. This locality is dated to the upper Campanian to lower Maastrichtian ages of the Late Cretaceous period. The first remains were described in 1996 and often appeared in the literature as the \"Argentinian ankylosaur\". The fossil material consists of various osteoderms, a tooth, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, and femora. The \"Patagopelta\" holotype specimen, MPCA-SM-78, is represented by a cervical half-ring element.\nNew remains described in 2022 allowed \"Patagopelta cristata\" to be described as a new genus and species of nodosaurine dinosaurs by Facundo Riguetti, Xabier Pereda-Suberbiola, Denis Ponce, Leonardo Salgado, , Sebasti\u00e1n Rozadilla, and Victoria Arbour. The generic name, \"Patagopelta\", is derived from \"Patago\", a reference to the discovery of the taxon in Argentinian Patagonia, and the Greek word \"pelta\", meaning \"shield\". The specific name, \"cristata\", means \"crested\" in Latin, referring to the large crests on its cervical osteoderms and femur.\nClassification.\nIn their phylogenetic analyses, Riguetti \"et al\". (2022) recovered \"Patagopelta\" as a member of the Nodosaurinae, within a clade of entirely North American nodosaurids from the middle of the Cretaceous period, in contrast to previous analyses that recovered it in the Panoplosaurini. In either case, it suggests that nodosaurids were part of a migration event of North American fauna into South America.\nThe cladogram below displays the results of their phylogenetic analyses.\nPaleoecology.\n\"Patagopelta\" is known from the Late Cretaceous Allen Formation of R\u00edo Negro Province, Argentina.

A year after the events of \"\", Anakin has succumbed to the dark side and become Darth Vader, and Ahsoka has gone into hiding. Under the name \"Ashla\", she gains work as a mechanic and freighter pilot with the powerful Fardi clan on the planet Thabeska. However, she is forced to go into hiding after exposing her Force powers while trying to save the life of four-year-old Hedala Fardi, the youngest Fardi daughter.\nAhsoka settles down on the agrarian moon of Raada where she befriends several local farmers including the teenage sisters Kaeden and Miara Larte, and their guardian Vartan. Ahsoka finds work as a mechanic and befriends the Larte sisters. The Galactic Empire subsequently establishes a presence on Raada and forces the farmers to plant new crops, which leach the moon's soils. Ahsoka becomes the leader of a resistance movement. However, the planned uprising goes awry and Ahsoka exposes her Force powers during a skirmish with Imperial forces. In response, the Empire dispatches a Jedi-hunting Inquisitor known as the Sixth Brother to hunt Ahsoka.\nHaving attracted the attention of the Empire, Ahsoka is forced to leave Raada.

Senator Organa's rebel fleet manages to evacuate the Raada farms following a skirmish with Imperial forces.\nFollowing the events on Raada, Ahsoka decides to join Senator Organa's rebellion while the Larte sisters and the other refugees settle down on Alderaan.

Upon completing these degrees, she moved to the United Kingdom to attend the University of Cambridge for her PhD in Criminology.\nCareer.\nFollowing her PhD at the University of Cambridge, Denov returned to Canada and became an assistant professor in the Department of Criminology at the University of Ottawa. In this role, she travelled to Sierra Leone to partner with a local NGO interviewing former child soldiers as part of a research project on the long-term effects of the war. During her time in Sierra Leone, she employed a community-based participatory research method called PhotoVoice which allows the former child soldiers to document their daily lives using cameras. \nDenov eventually joined the faculty of McGill University's School of Social Work where she was appointed a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Children, Families, and Armed Conflict to extend her research in the lived experiences of children during wartime. Denov used her 2014 Trudeau Foundation Fellowship to focus on children born of wartime rape. She collaborated with two NGOs to investigate these children's lived experiences and their relationships with their families and communities. As part of her fellowship, she co-developed an art-based research project involving 79 children who had been born into captivity in the LRA. The children created masks to narrate their experiences and process their traumatic memories. The results of her study found that children who were born to mothers abducted and raped by members of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) felt that wartime was better than peacetime. This was because they felt a greater sense of family cohesion and status within the LRA during the conflict. As well, following the conflict these children often endured stigmatization and social exclusion. \nFollowing her fellowship, Denov was named a member of the Royal Society of Canada's College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists for \"opening up new lines of inquiry and drawing international attention to war-affected children.\" In 2020, Denov was the recipient of a Killam Research Fellowship to focus on continuing her research investigating the perspectives, realities, and psychosocial needs of children born of war in northern Uganda.

In 2022, he was elected to a four-year term as a member of the Provincial Executive Committee of the ANC's Gauteng branch.\nEarly life and education.\nMakhubela was born in 1986. He has a Bachelor of Science in computer science from Illinois University in the United States.\nANC Youth League.\nMakhubela was active in the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) and chaired the league's local branch in Lotus Gardens in Tshwane. By 2015, he was the Regional Chairperson of the ANCYL's Tshwane branch, with Ezra Letsoalo as his deputy. In 2015, he was viewed by the \"Mail &amp; Guardian\" as one of the top contenders to succeed Julius Malema as President of the national ANCYL. When the league's national elective conference was held in September 2015, there was a minor uproar when another frontrunner, Ronald Lamola, apparently failed to gain the requisite support to stand as a nominee. Makhubela was nominated afterwards but declined the nomination, saying that he would prefer a recount of Lamola's nominations; Collen Maine was therefore elected unopposed.\nMakhubela remained in office as ANCYL Regional Chairperson and was re-elected to that position in October 2017.

In May 2021, Makhubela was expelled from the league on the grounds that he was indeed over the age of 35.\nIn July 2022, he was elected to the Provincial Executive Committee of the Gauteng branch of the mainstream ANC.

{"id": 73330460, "context": "Mikkel Overgaard Pedersen (born 26 January 1997) is a Danish racing driver who competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship for Dempsey-Proton Racing.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nBorn in Struer, Denmark, Pedersen's racing career began in karting at the age of seven. It was a family operation, with the Pedersens running the team out of a van in which they'd house the kart and travel to races. On Friday evenings, Mikkel would frequently watch the Porsche Supercup on TV, a series which he'd eventually compete in himself. Throughout his career Pedersen has relied on local sponsor support to fund his racing endeavors.\nIn 2012, Pedersen made his junior formula debut, taking part in the Danish Formula Ford Championship with DP Engineering. Pedersen's opening season in the series saw him compete in the Zetec category, driving the car that teammate Morten Dons had piloted the year prior. The following season, he stepped into Porsche racing, initially at a local level before expanding to the Porsche Carrera Cup Scandinavia in 2015. At the conclusion of the 2015 season, Pedersen traveled to the Lausitzring to take part in the annual Porsche Junior Shootout.\nPorsche Supercup.\nPedersen made his Supercup debut at the end of the 2015 season at Circuit of the Americas, where he was disqualified from the second event after the first race was canceled. The following season, Pedersen lined up a part-time campaign with MRS-GT Racing, supplemented with a drive at the 2016 Dubai 24 Hour. In 2017, he was able to compete for the full season, tallying a best finish of eighth at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez. His second full-time season improved on the prior, with Pedersen registering three top-ten finishes including a fifth-place finish at Monaco and a sixth-place finish at Hockenheim. At the conclusion of the 2018 season, he was named Motorsport Talent of the Year at the Danish Motorsport Awards.\nIn 2019, Pedersen left MRS-GT Racing, taking part in his fifth year in the series with Italian outfit Dinamic Motorsport. After utilizing a 2017 model for the previous two years, Pedersen upgraded to a 2019-spec version of the car. 2019 was Pedersen's best statistical season to date, as he claimed his maiden podium finish at Monaco and tallied two fastest laps, once at Monaco and again at Monza. He would finish eighth in the championship, racking up 80 championship points.\nGT3 and beyond.\nIn 2020, Pedersen continued with Dinamic for the team's globe-trotting GT3 program for the year. In January, he began the season at the Dubai 24 Hour, finishing on the GT3-Am class podium. Pedersen's primary program for the season was a drive in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup, where he'd join Adrien De Leener and Andrea Rizzoli in Dinamic's Silver Cup entry. In the opening round of the season at Imola, Pedersen's entry finished on the class podium, and would finish the season 13th in the Silver Cup classification. Pedersen returned to the team for the following season, stepping up to the Pro class as Romain Dumas replaced De Leener in the lineup. The team would claim just one point, earned in a 10th-place finish at Monza, and finished 32nd in the series championship.\nPedersen's program expanded in 2022, where he took on drives in the FIA World Endurance Championship, Le Mans Cup, and GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup. In the WEC, Pedersen served as the silver-ranked driver in one of Team Project 1's GTE Am class entries, joining Matteo Cairoli and Nicolas Leutwiler. With full-season entries guaranteeing a spot at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pedersen was able to fulfill a career dream of competing in the race. Although the entry retired due to puncture damage, the rest of the season proved relatively successful. The team claimed their first podium finish of the season at Monza, before taking victory in the final race of the season, the 8 Hours of Bahrain. The trio were classified seventh in the GTE Am class championship.\nPedersen's Le Mans Cup campaign took place with Danish team GMB Motorsport, where he piloted a Honda NSX GT3. He joined the team due to their long-term goal to compete at Le Mans in 2024, with the GT3 class being introduced to the race that year. Although he did not compete in the full season, being replaced by Jan Magnussen after the Monza round, Pedersen and co-driver Lars Engelbreckt Pedersen claimed one class victory over the course of five races.\nPedersen's GT World Challenge Europe campaign was much more patchwork than his previous endeavors. After re-joining Dinamic Motorsport for an expected one-off at the 24 Hours of Spa, Pedersen was asked to finish the season, joining Marius Nakken and Giorgio Roda in the team's Silver Cup entry. Pedersen scored 12 points over the course of three races, finishing 22nd in the class championship.\nPedersen began his 2023 campaign by taking part in the Asian Le Mans Series with Herberth Motorsport. During the four-race championship, the returning trio from the previous season's WEC entry tallied two top-five finishes and finished sixth in the championship. Pedersen's season continued with a full-season drive in the 2023 edition of the World Endurance Championship, albeit with a different team. He joined Dempsey-Proton Racing, driving alongside team principal Christian Ried and Frenchman Julien Andlauer. In the trio's first race, the 2023 1000 Miles of Sebring, the team claimed a podium finish.\nRacing record.\nComplete Porsche Supercup results.\n\u2020\u00a0\u2013 Driver did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed over 75% of the race distance.\nComplete GT World Challenge Europe results.\nGT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup.\n\u2020\u00a0\u2013 Driver did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed over 75% of the race distance.", "__index_level_0__": 8552, "length": 932, "pred": {"ppl": 4.2289023399, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0758132067, "ppl/zlib": 0.0006112516, "Min_5.0% Prob": 7.7083718808, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.2948595508, "Min_20.0% Prob": 4.7977753901, "Min_30.0% Prob": 3.914091131, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.2761848121, "Min_50.0% Prob": 2.7737454423, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.3776984245}, "question": "In which racing championship does Mikkel Overgaard Pedersen compete for Dempsey-Proton Racing?", "answer": "FIA World Endurance Championship", "prediction": "Question: In which racing championship does Mikkel Overgaard Pedersen compete for Dempsey-Proton Racing?\nAnswer: FIA World Endurance Championship", "generated_answer": "Formula E\n\nQ: The 41"}

{"id": 74243483, "context": "Frank is an American technology company that helped students find free scholarship money through an online college financial planning platform. Launched in 2016 by 24-year-old Charlie Javice, the software guided students through the online FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) application, helping them complete more than 100 questions within a few minutes. \nFrank was acquired by JPMorgan Chase in September 2021 for $175 million. In December 2022, the bank sued Javice and another company executive for fraud, alleging that they vastly inflated the number of customers that the company actually had. The Frank website was shut down shortly after in January 2023.\nHistory.\nFrank was founded in 2016 by Charlie Javice, a graduate from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Javice, who was 24-years-old at the time, said her goal was to reduce student debt. The original website was frankfafsa.com; however, the term FAFSA was removed in 2018 following a settlement with the U.S. Department of Education who owns trademark rights to the acronym.\nIn January 2018, Frank raised $10 million in funding from investors including Lemonade, WeWork, Bradley Tusk, and Marc Rowan, co-founder of Apollo Global Management. At that time, Frank had 18 full-time employees in the United States and Israel. Javice was named as one of \"Forbes\"' 30 Under 30 and \"Crain's New York's\" 40 under 40.\nOnline platform.\nFrank's online tool simplified the FAFSA process, helping students fill out the application quickly. In addition to filing their FASFA, students could also search for other scholarships and low-cost college courses. The website was free to use, but students could pay for additional membership features such as access to Frank's financial support team and access to a cash advance: up to $5,000 to cover tuition and other college costs while they waited for their financial aid to be approved, with no interest. Frank also helped students appeal financial aid decisions.\nIn November 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a warning letter to Frank raising concerns that the \u201cpurported assistance to students consists primarily of providing a form letter that may lack the information a student would need to apply for one of the grants from his or her school.\u201d\nJPMorgan Chase acquisition.\nJavice approached JPMorgan Chase in the summer of 2021 about a potential acquisition. In September 2021, Frank was purchased by the bank for $175 million to deepen ties with college students as potential customers. Javice remained CEO of Frank and joined JPMorgan Chase as head of student solutions on the digital products team.\nFifteen Frank employees were brought on as part of the acquisition, from mid-level associates to executive level. As part of the acquisition, Javice received more than $9 million directly in stock proceeds and a $20 million retention bonus. \nLawsuit.\nIn December 2022, JPMorgan Chase sued Charlie Javice and Frank chief growth officer Olivier Amar for fraud, alleging that they lied to the bank by making up millions of fake student accounts to show that it had a successful, growing business. The lawsuit was filed in a Delaware federal court. According to the lawsuit, Javice claimed that Frank had 4.25 million users; in reality, the company had fewer than 300,000. According to the lawsuit, Javice and Amar paid a data-science professor $18,000 to create a list of fake, user-generated names and addresses, in addition to purchasing a list of 4.5 million student names from a marketing firm.\nJPMorgan Chase claimed that it uncovered the fake user data when it launched an email-marketing campaign and more than 70% of the addresses that were allegedly Frank customers were not successfully delivered. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Javice with fraud, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Javice was arrested in April 2023 and has denied the allegations.\nIn a counter lawsuit, Javice sued JPMorgan Chase for wrongful termination after the bank fired her in November 2022, alleging she was owed millions of dollars for expenses incurred while defending herself against internal investigations. She also claimed the bank violated student privacy laws. In May 2023, a Delaware court ordered JPMorgan Chase to cover Javice's legal fees.\nJPMorgan Chase shut down the Frank website in January 2023.", "__index_level_0__": 12586, "length": 686, "pred": {"ppl": 4.642592907, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0214288762, "ppl/zlib": 0.0007611666, "Min_5.0% Prob": 7.5477796623, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.2786838157, "Min_20.0% Prob": 4.8807431528, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.0505588454, "Min_40.0% Prob": 3.4121862279, "Min_50.0% Prob": 2.9176391312, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.5162012924}, "question": "What company acquired Frank in September 2021?", "answer": "JPMorgan Chase", "prediction": "Question: What company acquired Frank in September 2021?\nAnswer: JPMorgan Chase", "generated_answer": "Meta Platforms\n\nQ: When do children"}

In 1991, a new species of the genus was described as \"Pelodiscus axenaria\", but its distinctiveness was often questioned until it was confirmed by molecular genetic studies in 2010. In 2018, Shiping Gong and colleagues discovered a genetically distinct lineage of the \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex. They initially called it \"lineage I\", until they described it as a new species, \"Pelodiscus shipian\", in 2022. Some older records of \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" may actually represent \"Pelodiscus shipian\". The \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex also includes \"Pelodiscus huangshanensis\", which was described in 2021.\nAfter Gong and colleagues discovered the cryptic \"lineage I\", another group of researchers also began collecting and studying specimens of the new lineage. They wrote a species description, where they gave \"lineage I\" the name \"Pelodiscus jiangxiensis\". As of October 2022, the paper is only accessible as a preprint and thus doesn't have any nomenclatural value according to the ICZN rules. The description of \"Pelodiscus shipian\", on the other hand, was published already in April 2022.\nPhylogeny.\nBased on phylogenetic analyses, \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is the sister species of \"Pelodiscus huangshanensis\", with the second closest relative being \"Pelodiscus axenaria\". These three species constitute the \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex, which forms a clade sister to all other \"Pelodiscus\" species.\nDescription.\n\"Pelodiscus shipian\" is a small species, with an adult carapace length of . \"Pelodiscus shipian\" can be confused with the other species of the \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex, especially with \"Pelodiscus axenaria\". The carapace color of \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is typically olive clay with greenish-black marbling. The carapace is distinctly keeled, and the entoplastron is boomerang-shaped. The plastron is yellowish-white and has no markings except for the dark patches near the armpits.\nDistribution and habitat.\nLike all species of the \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex, \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is endemic to China. The type locality is in Fengxin County, Jiangxi Province. Other genetically verified records exist from the neighboring Hunan Province. However, the exact distribution range of the species is still unknown. Both \"Pelodiscus shipian\" and \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" are confirmed to be present in Hunan, and they may be sympatric.\n\"Pelodiscus shipian\" has a strict habitat preference. It only lives in parts of rivers that have sandy bottoms and clear water that is rich in oxygen. It's also highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance.\nThreats.\nWithin its native range, \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is highly valued as human food. Hunting is not restricted or regulated, and the species is widely hunted by local villagers. The species is more restricted in its habitat preference than the much more common \"Pelodiscus sinensis\", making \"Pelodiscus shipian\" vulnerable to overhunting.", "__index_level_0__": 2166, "length": 550, "pred": {"ppl": 3.5253090858, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0706061699, "ppl/zlib": 0.000803039, "Min_5.0% Prob": 7.5471389464, "Min_10.0% Prob": 6.0922441206, "Min_20.0% Prob": 4.5491752105, "Min_30.0% Prob": 3.6194591744, "Min_40.0% Prob": 2.9597692761, "Min_50.0% Prob": 2.4714854926, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.0923306016}, "question": "What is the habitat preference of Pelodiscus shipian?", "answer": "Sandy bottoms of rivers with clear water that is rich in oxygen.", "prediction": "Question: What is the habitat preference of Pelodiscus shipian?\nAnswer: Sandy bottoms of rivers with clear water that is rich in oxygen.", "generated_answer": "freshwater lake in warm temperate areas\n\n"}

She is currently serving, since October 2022, as Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Social Development.\nBefore her current position, Ndalane was MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture from 2014 to 2016; MEC for Transport, Safety and Security from 2016 to 2017; MEC for Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure from 2017 to 2019; and MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development from 2019 to 2022. She is a member of the African National Congress (ANC) and was formerly a local leader of the ANC in her home region of Vhembe; she also served a term as a member of the Limpopo ANC's Provincial Executive Committee from 2018 to 2022.\nEarly life and career.\nNdalane was born in June 1963 in Elim in Vhembe in present-day Limpopo province. In the final years of apartheid, she worked in community development at a local non-governmental organisation called Akanani. During the first post-apartheid elections in 1994, she served as a party agent on the winning campaign of the African National Congress (ANC), and she was subsequently elected as a local councillor in the Vuwani\u2013Hlanganani Transitional Local Council.\nCareer in provincial government.\nNdalane was first elected as a Member of the Limpopo Provincial Legislature in the 1999 general election. While serving in the legislature, she rose through the ranks of the local ANC, becoming Deputy Regional Chairperson and later, from 2007, Regional Treasurer of the ANC's branch in Vhembe. In the fourth session of the Limpopo Provincial Legislature \u2013 following the 2009 general election, in which Ndalane was re-elected to her seat ranked 18th on the ANC's party list \u2013 she chaired the legislature's committee on sports, arts and culture.\nIn the 2014 general election, Ndalane was re-elected, on that occasion ranked 39th on the ANC's party list.

She held that position until a cabinet reshuffle on 15 September 2016, when she was moved to the Transport, Safety and Security portfolio. In October 2017, she was moved again, to the Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure portfolio, which was viewed as more senior.
