{"id": 72089652, "context": "In English cricket, the years 1846\u20131863 were the main period of the sport's \"roundarm era\". Although roundarm had been legalised amid great controversy, its timespan was relatively short. By 1863, there was an increasing demand for the legalisation of overarm bowling and this was achieved on 10 June 1864.\nTaking advantage of the \"railway boom\", the professional travelling elevens began to tour the country, staging matches against local teams before large crowds. The first of these was the All-England Eleven (the AEE), founded by William Clarke in 1846 and then managed by George Parr following Clarke's death. The rival United All England Eleven (the UEE) was established by Jemmy Dean and John Wisden in 1852. Travelling took on a global aspect when, for the first time, an international England team was formed to undertake the first overseas tours to North America in 1859 (this was, in fact, by a combined AEE/UEE team) and Australia in 1861\u201362.\nIn 1846 there were only four definitive county clubs. Sussex County Cricket Club was the oldest, having been founded in 1839. It had been followed by Nottinghamshire in 1841, Cambridgeshire in 1844 and Surrey in 1845. Kent County Cricket Club had a complex history with separate organisations founded in 1842 and 1859 \u2013 these merged to form the present Kent club in 1870. Yorkshire, Hampshire and Middlesex were all founded in 1863.\nEngland Elevens.\nSocial conditions, especially the railways, were a key factor in the creation of the travelling All-England Eleven (the AEE). The team was founded in Nottingham by William Clarke. Taking advantage of the \"railway boom\", they travelled throughout Great Britain and were a significant factor in the spread of cricket. The first AEE match was against a Sheffield XX in September and they played others in Manchester and Leeds. The original AEE team was: William Clarke, Jemmy Dean, William Dorrinton, Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Joe Guy, Will Martingell, Tom Sewell, George Butler, Villiers Smith and William Hillyer. Other players who represented the AEE in its early days included George Parr, William Lillywhite, Nicholas Felix, William Denison, Thomas Box and Oliver Pell.\nIn 1852, the United All England Eleven (the UEE) was established as a rival to the AEE. Jemmy Dean and John Wisden were the main organisers and other players to represent the UEE in its early years included John Lillywhite, Tom Lockyer, Jem Grundy, F. P. Miller, Will Mortlock and Tom Sherman.\nIn 1857, the AEE and UEE began an annual series of matches against each other that continued until 1869. The fixture was the most important of the season while it lasted. Two games were played in 1857, both at Lord's and both won by the AEE whose players in 1857 included George Parr (captain), Alfred Diver, H. H. Stephenson, Julius Caesar, Cris Tinley, George Anderson, Ned Willsher and John Jackson. UEE players in 1857 included: John Wisden (captain), Jemmy Dean, Jem Grundy, William Caffyn, John Lillywhite, Tom Lockyer, Will Mortlock and Will Martingell. Also in 1857, the Cricketers Fund Friendly Society was instituted and, for ten years, the great match between the AEE and the UEE was played in its support.\nOn 7 September 1859, the departure of cricket's first-ever touring team. A photograph was taken on board ship before they sailed from Liverpool. The team of English professionals went to North America and played five matches, winning them all. There were no top-class fixtures. The 12-man squad was: George Parr (captain), James Grundy, John Jackson (all of Nottinghamshire); Robert Carpenter, Alfred Diver, Thomas Hayward (all of Cambridgeshire); Julius Caesar, William Caffyn, Tom Lockyer, H. H. Stephenson (all of Surrey); John Lillywhite, John Wisden (both of Sussex).\nH. H. Stephenson (Surrey) captained the first English team to tour Australia. The other players were William Caffyn, Will Mortlock, George Griffith, William Mudie, Tom Sewell Jr (all Surrey); Roger Iddison, Ned Stephenson (both Yorkshire); Tom Hearne, Charles Lawrence (both Middlesex); George Wells (Sussex); and George Bennett (Kent). H. H. Stephenson and Caffyn had toured America in 1859. They were abroad from October 1861 until May 1862. One top-class match was played and twelve, mostly against odds of at least 18 to 11, that were non-top-class.\nMatches, venues and teams.\nAccording to the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (the ACS), a total of 534 top-class matches were played in the eighteen English seasons from 1846 to 1863 inclusive. Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were especially prolific. There was no national championship and the matches were all arranged on an \"ad hoc\" basis, although some such as Gentlemen v Players and North v South had become traditional events in the cricketing calendar. As a rule, these matches were eleven-a-side with double innings and usually played over three days.\nHaving begun in 1827, the University Match between Cambridge University Cricket Club (CUCC) and Oxford University Cricket Club (OUCC) had become an annual event by 1846 and it was played every year from then to 1863.\nKent had a strong team in the 1840s which included Nicholas Felix, William Hillyer, Alfred Mynn and Fuller Pilch.\nOn 23, 24 &amp; 25 July 1849, Sheffield Cricket Club and Manchester Cricket Club met at Hyde Park in Sheffield. For the first time, the match was billed as \"Yorkshire v Lancashire\" and it is recognised as the first Roses Match. Yorkshire won by 5 wickets.\nMiddlesex re-emerged as a county team in 1850, largely through the efforts of the Walker family that eventually founded the present Middlesex County Cricket Club.\nOn 1 March 1859, the second Kent county club was formed and based at Maidstone. This club was commonly called West Kent while the existing Canterbury one, formed in 1842, was known as East Kent, a scenario which reflected the Dorset/Mann teams of the 18th century. The two organisations eventually merged in 1870 to form the existing Kent County Cricket Club.\nThree county clubs were founded in 1863. On 8 January, Yorkshire County Cricket Club was founded out of the Sheffield Match Fund Committee that had been established on 7 March 1861. This was an exact parallel with the formation of Sussex County Cricket Club from a similar fund (1836\u20131839). Yorkshire played their inaugural top-class match against Surrey at The Oval on 4, 5 &amp; 6 June. It was a rain-affected draw, evenly balanced. Hampshire County Cricket Club was founded on 12 August. A number of previous county organisations including the famous Hambledon Club had existed in Hampshire for over a century, but none had survived indefinitely. On 15 December, Middlesex County Cricket Club was founded at a meeting in the London Tavern.\nBesides MCC, CUCC, OUCC and the new county clubs, other significant teams represented Manchester Cricket Club, Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club. There was an increase in northern matches with the three main town clubs regularly challenging each other. \nNew grounds in the period included Bramall Lane, which superseded Hyde Park in Sheffield; Old Trafford in Manchester; and Fenner's in Cambridge. Elsewhere, Lord's remained the sport's feature venue and there was increasing usage of the Magdalen Ground in Oxford; Trent Bridge in Nottingham; and The Oval in south London. The first top-class match at The Oval was Surrey Club v MCC on 25 &amp; 26 May 1846. Only 194 runs were scored in the match with a top score of 13. William Hillyer took 14 wickets to help MCC win by 48 runs. Surrey County Cricket Club played its initial top-class match v Kent at The Oval on 25 &amp; 26 June 1846, winning by 10 wickets.\nGentlemen v Players.\nBetween 1846 and 1863, a total of 26 Gentlemen v Players matches were played. Until 1856, the match was played at Lord's at least once a season. It was contested twice a season from 1857 to 1863, once at Lord's and once at The Oval. The Players won 21 of the 26 matches, the Gentlemen won four, and one match was tied.\nNorth v South.\nBefore 1846, North v South had only been played four times, the last time in 1838. The competition was revived in 1849 and was contested at least once per season until 1863, for a total of 28 encounters. It was frequently contested twice a year, with three matches in each years 1857 and 1863. The North won 16 of the 28 matches, the South won 8, and the remaining four were drawn.\nNotable cricketers.\nW. G. Grace was born on 18 July 1848 at Downend, near Bristol. \nAt Lord's, Alfred Baillie succeeded Roger Kynaston as MCC secretary in 1858 and Robert Allan Fitzgerald succeeded Baillie, who resigned due to ill health in 1863.\nActive players, administrators and other contributors of the period included:\nAchievements.\nIn a match played 27\u201329 May 1847 between MCC and Oxford University, William Hillyer completed the first recorded \"match double\" of 100 runs and ten wickets in a top-class game, scoring 26 and 83 and taking thirteen wickets. The feat was not accomplished again until 1859 by V. E. Walker. Since then, it has been accomplished numerous times, most frequently by W. G. Grace.\nIn 1850, John Wisden bowled all ten batsmen in one innings, playing for North v South at Lord's.\nOn 27 July 1852, John Sherman made his final top-class appearance for Manchester v. Sheffield at Hyde Park, Sheffield. His career had spanned 44 seasons from his debut at Lord's on 20 September 1809 when he played for Beauclerk's XI v. Ladbroke's XI. His was the longest top-class career span, equalled only by W. G. Grace.\nOn 21, 22 &amp; 23 July 1859, V. E. Walker of Middlesex, playing for England v. Surrey at The Oval, took all ten wickets in the Surrey first innings and followed by scoring 108 in the England second innings, having been the not out batsman in the first (20*). He took a further four wickets in Surrey's second innings. England won by 392 runs.\nRules and equipment history.\nIn 1846, Lord's introduced the Telegraph Score Board, and scorecards were sold for the first time. The first mowing machinery were employed on cricket fields around 1850, but sheep were still utilized at Lord's for many years after that. The simple wicket-keeping gloves gave way to the now-famous cushioned gauntlets. The follow-on differential was lowered to 80 in 1854. (60 in a one-day match).\nJem Grundy became the first player to be given out handled the ball when playing for MCC v Kent at Lord's in 1857.\nIn 1859, the earliest reference has been found of a hat being presented to a bowler who had taken wickets with three successive deliveries, hence hat-trick.\nOn 26 August 1862, Surrey played against an England XI at The Oval. Edgar Willsher of England was no-balled six times in succession by John Lillywhite (son of William Lillywhite) for bowling with his hand above the shoulder. For some years previously, Willsher and others had bowled in this way and the incident at The Oval put the issue into context. The drama was exaggerated when Willsher and the other eight professionals in the England team walked off the field. Play continued next day but with a replacement umpire. Compared with the introduction of roundarm, this controversy was short-lived and overarm bowling was legalised in 1864.\nMCC and Lord's.\nLord's hosted the last Public Schools Weeks (Eton, Harrow, and Winchester) in 1854.\nAlfred Baillie replaced Roger Kynaston as MCC Secretary in 1858. Kynaston has been in charge since 1842. Robert Allan Fitzgerald replaced Baillie, who resigned due to illness, in 1863. Fitzgerald became the first paid secretary on January 1, 1867, and held the position until 1876.\nThe Eyre Estate sold the freehold of Lord's to Isaac Moses, a property trader, at public auction in 1860 for \u00a37,000. MCC did not submit a bid. James Dark held the leasehold until 1864, when he ceded it to MCC, who afterwards purchased the freehold from Mr Moses at a substantial profit.\nSingle wicket.\nIn 1846, the last match played for the Single Wicket Championship was between Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix.\nThe last top-class single wicket event was held in 1848.\nLiterature.\nPublication in 1862 of volumes 1\u20134 of \"Scores and Biographies\", compiled by Arthur Haygarth.

{"id": 70528035, "context": "The Latino Community Credit Union (LCCU) is located in Durham, North Carolina. The LCCU was established in 2000 in Downtown Durham, North Carolina. It became the first Latino credit union in North Carolina and is currently the only Latino Credit Union in the state. Today, it has over 90,000 members and 15 locations across North Carolina.\nHistory.\nThe LCCU arose in response to a Latino exclusion from local banking services due to illiteracy, lack of documentation, and language barriers, as well as response to the increasing violence in Durham against these communities.\nLatinos in Durham during the 1990s.\nDurham\u2019s Latino immigrant community experienced issues regarding violence and theft in the 1990s. According to John Herrera, vice president for Latino affairs at the Durham-based Self-Help Credit union, \u201cin 1996, [Durham] experienced an outbreak of violence in the community\u2013 home invasions, attacks, and robberies\u2013 due to the lack of access to financial institutions\u201d.\nLatinos paid everything with cash; from rent to car payments. Latinos became victims and \u201ceasy targets\u201d for violent crimes, making them vulnerable to the ongoing violence that took place in Durham. Additionally, the cash culture among Latino immigrants resulted in a lack of credit history because individuals could not report any activity to credit agencies. Without a credit history, Latinos and Hispanics could not build a foundation for borrowing funds to purchase homes, cars, or establish new businesses. Understanding and trusting banks in the United States became a huge barrier for many Latino and Hispanic immigrants. To overcome this barrier, educating communities became crucial to the success of this community.\nFounding.\nLeaders of the Triangle\u2019s Hispanic community came together to resolve the situation among Latinos in Durham. Ivan Parra, Executive Director of El Centro Hispano in Durham, and John Herrera led the initiative to establish a credit union for Hispanics and Latinos; both community members that had extensive involvement in community engagement and groups before.\nOrganizations and groups from a diverse range of sectors came together to share resources in an attempt to create a successful credit union that would give opportunities to the largest minority group in Durham.\nThese groups included immigrant support groups, the North Carolina State Employees\u2019 Credit Union, marketing partners, and other local foundations.\nStart-up deposits from these groups totaled around $2.5 million, resulting in a strong financial footing that led to considerable future success.\nEstablishment.\nIn 2000, the LCCU established itself at El Centro Hispano on Chapel Hill Road in Durham. El Centro Hispano is a local non-profit organization founded in 1992, whose mission has been to \u201cstrengthen the [Hispanic] community [in Durham], build bridges, and advocate for equity and inclusion\u201d by providing a variety of services to the community. When the credit union opened members of the center automatically enrolled into the credit union, and anyone who joined the credit union would also belong to the center. This membership drive aimed to have at least 5,000 members enrolled in both institutions, hoping to aid the Hispanic community with as many resources as possible in an accessible manner. The credit union started by offering free cash-checking services, savings accounts, loans, and money wiring services.\nCommunity support programs.\nIn 2002, the LCCU sponsored the creation of the Latino Community Development Center, or LCDC. This organization \u201cpromotes financial literacy, access to financial services, and economic development for the low income immigrant Latino population in North Carolina.\u201d\nBy 2010, the LCCU offered a financial education program, Building a Better Future, consisting of six workshops that teach financial literacy to members of the credit union. Over 180 participants graduated from the program within the first few years of its establishment.\nIn 2016, the LCCU established a scholarship program with the goal of increasing access to higher education among its members. Scholarship recipients are supported to launch their professional careers in a variety of areas, aimed to \u201cempower its members to achieve their dreams and give back to their community\u201d.\nAssets.\nIn 2003, the LCCU held $11 million in assets and had 8,000 members. By 2013, the LCCU had over 55,000 members, $125 million in assets, and $227 million in financing. Of the people it served, 95% came from low-income backgrounds, 75% had never opened a bank account, and 2,000 became first-time homeowners.\nAs of December 2021, the credit union had over $720 million in assets, $1.3 billion in local financing, and its scholarship program awarded over $455,000 since its start.\nBranches.\nThe LCCU grew substantially by 2010, opening new branches in Winston-Salem, Charlotte, Garner, Carrboro, and Monroe.\nAs of April 2022, the LCCU had a total of 15 branches across North Carolina.

{"id": 73945277, "context": "Phintella occidentalis is a species of jumping spider in the genus \"Phintella\" that lives in Ivory Coast. First described by Wanda Weso\u0142owska and Anthony Russell-Smith in 2022, the species is named after the Latin word for western as it is found in West Africa. The spider is small, with a cephalothorax between long and an abdomen that is between long. The female is smaller than the male. The carapace is brown, the female light and the male dark. The abdomen is yellow and is marked by two wide brown stripes on the female and a grey streak on the male. It is the abdominal pattern that most clearly distinguishes the species from others in the genus. The copulatory organs are also different. The male has a longer tibial apophysis, or appendage and the female has seminal ducts that diverge and then converge.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Phintella occidentalis\" was first described in 2022 by Wanda Weso\u0142owska and Anthony Russell-Smith. The species is one of more than 500 described by Weso\u0142owska. The species name is the Latin for western and relates to the fact that it comes from West Africa. It was allocated to the genus \"Phintella\", raised in 1906 by Embrik Strand and W. B\u00f6senberg. The genus name derives from the genus \"Phintia\", which it resembles. The genus \"Phintia\" was itself renamed \"Phintodes\", which was subsequently absorbed into \"Tylogonus\". There are similarities between spiders within genus \"Phintella\" and those in \"Chira\", \"Chrysilla\", \"Euophrys\", \"Icius\", \"Jotus\" and \"Telamonia\". Genetic analysis confirms that it is related to the genera \"Helvetia\" and \"Menemerus\" and is classified in the tribe Chrysillini, named after the genus \"Chrysilla\". In 2017, Jerzy Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski grouped the genus with 32 other genera of jumping spiders under the name Chrysillines in the supergroup Chrysilloida.\nDescription.\n\"Phintella occidentalis\" is a small spider. The female has a cephalothorax that typically has a length of and a width of . It has a light brown carapace with a darker eye field. There are white hairs on the side and the clypeus. The abdomen is typically long and wide. It is yellow with a pattern of two wide brown stripes down the middle on the top and additional stripes on the sides. The spinnerets are yellow and the chelicerae are yellow-brown. The legs are also yellow, with brown hairs and spines. The epigyne is small and has seminal ducts that initially diverge before converging on large spherical spermathecae.\nThe male is longer than the female. It has a cephalothorax that is typically long and wide and an abdomen that is long and wide. The carapace is dark brown with a lighter area near the eye field. The eyes have fawn hairs around them. The chelicerae are unidentate, with small teeth, and light brown. The abdomen is hairy and yellow, apart from a grey streak down the middle on the top and four lines of dots on the underside, and has dark lines along the sides. The legs are long and thin. The spinnerets and pedipalps are brown. The palpal bulb is has a curved embolus and relatively long appendage, or apophysis, on the tibia.\nThe species can be identified by the pattern on the abdomen, which is particularly pronounced on the female. Superficially, the copulatory organs are similar to the related \"Phintella popovi\" but the length of the tibial apophysis on the male and morphology of the seminal ducts on the female can help tell the two the species apart.\nDistribution.\n\"Phintella occidentalis\" is endemic to Ivory Coast.

{"id": 72910043, "context": "On 4 November 2020, anti-poaching forces of the Botswana Defence Force (BDF) killed four men at Sedudu on the Chobe River at the Botswana\u2013Namibia border. The men killed were brothers Tommy Nchindo, Martin Nchindo, and Wamunyima Nchindo, and their cousin Sinvula Munyeme. The killings caused an international incident between Botswana and Namibia.\nBackground.\nBotswana has historically struggled to address poaching, and the government had authorised military force with a shoot-to-kill policy to protect native fauna. The policy is controversial in the Southern Africa region, with critics arguing that it presents a threat to innocent civilians. At least 12 suspected poachers had previously been killed by Botswana Defence Force anti-poaching forces in 2020, and a total of 37 Namibian citizens were killed in poaching raids by December 2021. The countries of Botswana and Namibia share close relations, but the shoot-to-kill policy has caused tension between the two governments and their citizens.\nIn 2018, the government of Botswana hired a Namibian man to monitor activity on the Chobe River while working as a tour guide. The tour guide alerted the BDF after spotting the four men on the Chobe River. A brother of one of the victims who is still alive claims that the tour guide knew the Nchindo family personally before the killings.\nKillings.\nAt approximately 11pm on 4 November 2020, brothers Tommy Nchindo, Martin Nchindo, and Wamunyima Nchindo, and their cousin Sinvula Munyeme were killed by anti-poaching forces of the Botswana Defence Force at Sedudu on the Chobe River at the Botswana\u2013Namibia border. Relatives of the deceased said that they were not poachers, but that they were fishermen and that they were unarmed.\nAftermath.\nThe incident challenged diplomatic relations between Botswana and Namibia and began a long term escalation of the debate over BDF practices at the Botswana\u2013Namibia border. Following the incident, President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana and President Hage Geingob of Namibia spoke over the telephone to discuss a joint investigation, and Geingob received the family of the deceased at the state house. Geingob condemned the shoot-to-kill policy and supported the position that the men killed were innocent civilians. The diplomatic aspects of the incident were complicated by the site of the killings at Sedudu, which had been the subject of an intense border dispute 21 years prior. In response to the killings, anti-Botswana protests took place in Namibia cities including Windhoek and Katima Mulilo.\nThe government of Botswana announced an inquest into the killings in November 2021. Namibian Lives Matter criticised the action, arguing that it should instead be brought to trial as a murder case under the High Court of Botswana. Presiding officer Taboka Mopipi ruled in January 2022 that the killings were an act of self-defence after determining that the men killed were the first to shoot. Namibian Lives Matter's leader Sinvula Mudabeti condemned the ruling, describing it as a \"miscarriage of justice\", arguing that no weapons were found at the scene. New allegations were made by the Namibian government in December 2021 that the men killed were forcibly abducted from Namibian territory by the BDF and taken Botswana to have them killed, though this point was conceded by the Namibian government at the conclusion of the inquest.

{"id": 73392240, "context": "The Port of Whitby is an ancient and historic seaport on the North Yorkshire coast of England. The port lies at the mouth of the River Esk, where it enters into the North Sea. A port has been in existence at Whitby since at least the 7th century, when it was used to bring in supplies for Whitby Abbey. The port is famous for being the port of origin for the sailings of Captain Cook, and some of the ships that he sailed on were also built in the harbour.\nCommercial cargo ceased in the late 20th century, however, the port is still an important location for the landing of fish.\nHistory.\nNo records exist of actual dates when the port started, but fish were being landed at Whitby during the time that the first abbey had been built in 657. It is thought that the port was in what is now the upper harbour (south of the swing bridge, as coastal erosion had not yet subjected the lower harbour cliff walls to collapse, making that side of the estuary too steep to house piers). William de Percy granted the port to the abbey at Whitby, a grant which was confirmed by William II sometime before 1096. In 1122, a dispute was recorded in the collection of tithes from fishermen due to the abbot, which also noted that coal was imported into Whitby.\nDuring the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the ports of England were administered by the Exchequer, who divided the ports into the main ports, with lesser ports on the coast near to them being labelled as \"creco\" or \"creek ports\". Whitby was a creek port of Newcastle with a reach to what is Spital Bridge in the town, but the authority of the port later reached upstream to the tidal limit of Ruswarp.\nThe port was never equal to other ports in the area such as Hull or Middlesbrough. This is due to the hinterland that surrounded the port, with Whitby being largely cut-off from overland travel until the 18th and 19th centuries, it had no great industries to export or import for, being surrounded on all sides of the river by moorland (except for the coast to the north). Trade through the port accelerated with the coming of the railways, but its main function was either as a shelter for ships from storms in the North Sea, or as a re-supply point. Between 1702 and 1704, the number of collier ships alone totalled 98, Bridlington, Hull and Scarborough only hosted 48, 28 and 54 respectively. The safe haven almost guaranteed at Whitby (and at Scarborough and Bridlington too), allowed the port to charge a levy towards the upkeep of the harbour and piers. The levy also applied to passing trade of coal from many north-eastern locations, with the levy not being rescinded until 1861.\nDuring the era of timber shipbuilding (mid 16th\u2013late 19th centuries), vessels would arrive from the St. Lawrence Rivercarrying timber, masts and bowsprits. These vessels were too large to enter the harbour, and would unload their cargo onto smaller ships in the Whitby Roads. The smaller craft would then enter the harbour to unload the delivery on the dockside. Another method of offloading goods from the ship without actually entering Whitby harbour was to beach the vessel on the sand. This was a common practice for delivering coal to places such as Sandsend, and for which, the Whitby Cats (a flat-bottomed boat), was specifically designed for.\nA survey in the 1950s determined that the port at Whitby was not as successful as other neighbouring cargo ports such as Hull, Teesside and West Hartlepool, on account of its lack of urban sprawl, and the absence of warehouses on the dock side with which to store goods in a safe manner before onward export, or inward transportation. It also suffered a loss of traffic due to the depth of the water in the harbour; as the sailing ships gave way to first paddle steamers, and then steel boats of even bigger sizes, the newer ships could not negotiate into the harbour.\nWhitby's port was divided into two main sections; the upper harbour south of the swing bridge, and the lower harbour, north of the swing bridge. The lower harbour has been the location of the fish markets during the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1956, a new fish quay was built adjacent to Pier Road on the west bank of the River Esk. Dredging along the lower harbour had damaged the previous fish quay which had been built in 1914. The fish market in Whitby port increased after the railways arrived in the town as this allowed fresh fish to be dispatched across the country at a faster pace than delivered by boat.\nPart of the upper harbour area was converted into a marina between 2008 and 2010.\n21st century port.\nThe maximum DWT in the port is , with a length of , a beam of and a draught of . However, cargo trade, except for fish-landing, ceased in the year 2000.\nCommodities.\nHistorically, the port was known for its involvement in the export of alum, and the importing of timber, nominally for building ships. Timber, flax and hemp were imported from the Baltic states during the 18th and 19th centuries, but this was to further the shipbuilding, and during the winter months even more importantly, the ship repairing trade due to Whitby's location as a safe port. However, its most lasting and notable trade has been in the landing of fish and the whale industry. In the 17th century, herring were being exported to Scotland, and the associated herring industry required the import of salt.\nIn the early 17th century, the record books begin to show more and more trade within the port due to the accelerated demand of the alum industry. Coal is shown as increasing rapidly, though peat burning was still being used in domestic capacities, so the increase in coal volumes is tied to the alum-making. A storehouse for coal was built near \"Haggersgate\", a road in the town on the west bank of the harbour where the new fish quay is. Also imported were malt, rye and wine. Exports were finished alum, the bark stripped from timber being used for shipbuilding, and sailcloth. One of the oddest commodities imported into the harbour was human urine. The alum industry required ammonia as part of its process, and the easiest source of this at the time was human urine. Whilst some came in from local areas, it was brought in from as far afield as Newcastle and London.\nIn 1675, the port was handling alum, ham, butter, salt and fish. Several alum works existed in the area around Whitby, and so the port offered a natural point of offloading. This in turn generated export of alum, and the import of timber, so that Whitby could build its own ships to transport the goods needed, and export the finished alum itself. The landing of whales at Whitby flourished between 1753 and 1835, concentrated on the Northern Whale Fishery around Greenland. No attempt was made by Whitby boats to try whaling in Antarctica , the favoured region by whalers sailing from Hull and London. However, the whaling industry in Whitby was described as a \"losing concern\" in a government report of 1833 as oil was available from other sources. Between 1753 and 1835, a total of 2,687 whale carcasses were brought back to the port, an average of 32 per year. The rendering of whale blubber was undertaken further upriver than the port, around the area where Larpool Viaduct now stands. The waste from the blubber to oil process, known locally as \"Fenks\", was exported from the port as a manure.\nA sample of imports and exports from 1790 shows that imports consisted of fruit, wine, spices and other foods, but most critically, the greatest tonnage came in the form of oars, anchors, pitch, oakum, timber, hemp, rope, cordage, linen and hessian canvas, all of which were essential to the shipbuilding industry. The balance in the exports was a less comprehensive list but included wines, tar, alum, bacon, ham, butter, oats, ale, whale products and dried fish. Again, items associated with the shipbuilding industry are present, but the most interesting export was sleepers and pit props, of which nearly 17,000 were dispatched by ship. \nIn the 19th century, coal which was formerly offloaded at Whitby, started to arrive in the town via the railway. As most collieries were connected to the railway, and the loading charges for taking wagons over the railway had already been paid by the colliery, having to then trans-ship the coal to a boat to deliver within the UK was uneconomically viable at that time. Iron ore and iron products were exported through Whitby by the South Cleveland Iron Works, who had a smelter at Grosmont, some south of Whitby accessible by the Whitby &amp; Pickering Railway. Smaller iron ore concerns also used the port, with most being transferred to either Teesside or Tyneside by ship, but this was short-lived in the face of the increasing railway network and the quick exhaustion of iron ore seams in the area. Buoyed by the arrival of the railways, minerals were exported through the port, and local sandstone from Aislaby was sent to London to build London Bridge and the Houses of Parliament. \nWhilst ferries are not known to have operated from Whitby, shipping did take passengers in the form of convicts transported to Australia and emigrants to Canada, usually to St Lawrence in the 1820s and 1830s.", "__index_level_0__": 8843, "length": 1592, "question": "What is the main function of the Port of Whitby?", "answer": "The main function of the Port of Whitby is the landing of fish.", "prediction": "Question: What is the main function of the Port of Whitby?\nAnswer: The main function of the Port of Whitby is the landing of fish.", "generated_answer": " transloading of grain shipments\n\nQ: How"}

{"id": 73845351, "context": "Aphrahat, Aphraat, Aphraates or Afrates (i; ; and ) was a fourth-century Persian-born hermit who was active in Mesopotamia and Syria during the reign of Emperor Valens () and perhaps Theodosius (). His life is known only from the account of Theodoret, who was reportedly taken as a boy to visit the hermit in Antioch and was blessed by him.\nAphraates was a native of the Sassanian Empire, but after converting to Christianity, he decided to go to Edessa. There he would become a hermit and live a life of penance and contemplation of heaven. Years later, he moved to a hermitage near Antioch, where he would be visited by many people seeking advice. He was visited by an ambassador named Anthemius, perhaps the future Praetorian prefect of the East and roman consul of the same name, and came into conflict with Valens for his persecution of the Orthodox.\nLife.\nAphrahat belonged to a Persian family native to the Sassanian Empire. After converting to Christianity, he settled in Edessa, Mesopotamia, to decide how best to serve God. There, he decided to follow a life of seclusion and moved to a cell outside the city walls, where he devoted himself to penance and the contemplation of heaven. His diet consisted of bread, to which he added vegetables when he was old, which he ate after sunset, and his bed was a mat on the floor. His clothing consisted of a coarse garment.\nAfter some time, Aphrahat moved his residence to a hermitage next to a monastery near Antioch in Syria, where people gradually began to seek his advice. One of the individuals to visit him was Anthemius, who had returned from an embassy to the Sassanian Empire and brought with him a garment produced in the hermit's homeland. Aphrahat is alleged to have asked whether it was reasonable to exchange a trusted old servant for a new one merely because he was a fellow countryman. Anthemius is alleged to have replied, \"Certainly not,\" and Aphrahat retorted, \"Then take back your tunic, for I have one that I have worn for 16 years, and I need no more than one.\"\nIt is not certain when the meeting of Anthemius and Aphrahat took place. The authors of the \"PLRE\", in associating the diplomat with the namesake Praetorian prefect of the East and consul, have dated the event to 383, when Anthemius was returning from an embassy to Persia sent by the emperor Theodosius alongside another official, the barbarian Stilicho. The \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\", on the other hand, makes no mention of this diplomat being the Theodosius' officer and dates the episode between 375 and 378, when negotiations were in progress to end the ongoing war between Emperor Valens and Shapur II (). The editors of \"Butler's Lives of the Saints\" agree with PLRE on the association of the characters, but do not give a dating.\nDuring the reign of Valens, who was an Arian (not to be confused with the racialist ideology of Aryanism), there was great persecution of those who followed the Nicene creed. In the 370's, when the emperor settled with his army in Antioch for his war against the Persians, the patriarch Meletius was banished and the Arians carried out a severe persecution of the orthodox. Due to the disturbances caused by the imperial actions, Aphrahat headed to Antioch, where he assisted Flavian and Diodorus who had been entrusted with the government of the Catholics during Meletius' exile. Because he had a great reputation stemming from his holiness and miracles, his actions and words carried weight.\nDue to the capture of the local churches by the Arians, the Orthodox were forced to hold their services beside the Orontes River or in the large open space outside the city in which military exercises were held. On one day, hurrying along the road leading to the training camp, Aphrahat was stopped on orders by Valens, who was standing on the portico of his palace. The emperor asked him where he was going, and Aphrahat reportedly replied, \"to pray for the world and the emperor\". The monarch then questioned him why, being dressed as a monk, he was wandering away from his cell.\nTo this, Aphrahat answered with a parable: \"If I were a damsel withdrawn from my father's house, and I saw it on fire, would you advise me to sit back and let it burn? It is not I who should be blamed, but you who lit the flames that I am struggling to extinguish. We are doing nothing contrary to our profession when we put together and nurture the adherents of the true faith.\" The emperor did not retort, but one of his servants reviled Aphraates, who was threatened with death. Shortly thereafter, the same individual was accidentally scalded to death, causing terror in Valente who refused to listen to the Arians who pressured him to banish Aphrahat. He was also impressed by the miracles of the hermit, who not only healed men and women, but also his favorite horse.", "__index_level_0__": 10817, "length": 831, "question": "What did Aphrahat ask the emperor when he was questioned about wandering away from his cell?", "answer": "\"If I were a damsel withdrawn from my father's house, and I saw it on fire, would you advise me to sit back and let it burn?\"", "prediction": "Question: What did Aphrahat ask the emperor when he was questioned about wandering away from his cell?\nAnswer: \"If I were a damsel withdrawn from my father's house, and I saw it on fire, would you advise me to sit back and let it burn?\"", "generated_answer": " 'Officer, what has brought you here?'"}

Families like Bappu, Naduveedhi, and Maniam settled in Kathanpallam. Over time, intermarriages with Keerakathi, Thottam, Nesavu, and Sepoy families led to the formation of around 150 Catholic families in this village.\nUntil 1937, deceased Catholics from Katanpallam were interred in the Elathagiri cemetery. However, in 1937, due to a flood, people were unable to cross the river to reach the Elathagiri cemetery. As a result, burials began in Kathanpallam, eventually leading to the establishment of a cemetery in their village itself.\nIn 1995, the Sisters of Gonzaga acquired land in Kathanpallam to build a convent, school, and college. During this period, Fr. M. Arulsamy, the Elathagiri Parish Priest, procured 1.7 acres of land from the Bappu Family to construct a church. The land originally belonged to their late uncle, Soosai (Sepoy), who left it to his nephews. The nephews donated the land for the church, and requested to name the church in honor of St. Joseph, also known as Soosai.\nIn 1997, Fr. M. Arulsamy laid the foundation for a chapel in Kathanpallam, which was later completed by Fr. M. Jegaraj. Former Bishop Joseph Anthony Irudayaraj blessed and inaugurated the chapel on February 13, 1999. Weekly Wednesday masses were conducted by Elathagiri Parish priests in the chapel, and from 2010 onwards, Sunday masses were also held there.\nDue to limited space in the existing chapel, Bishop Lawrence Pius approved the construction of a new church for Kathanpallam.

{"id": 71772190, "context": "IpOp model is a strategic management approach for pre-project analysis suitable for innovation management and corporate entrepreneurship. Besides guiding innovators on how to analyze an opportunity, it explains how to draft an opportunity case or a business plan to let decision-makers, such as investors, or management, assess the merits of the opportunity.\nHistory.\nThe IpOp model was initially developed by Raphael H. Cohen, academic fellow and academic director for 20 years of the Entrepreneurial Leadership program at the University of Geneva, to help companies in their innovation management. It was first presented in 2006 in \"Concevoir et lancer un projet\", a French book that has been later translated into English and Spanish. IpOp stands for \"Innovation per Opportunities\u201d or how to innovate by seizing opportunities. The latest version of the book was published in 2016 and contains an improved version of the IpOp Model. In 2011 the 2006 version of the model was presented in Cohen's book \"Winning Opportunities, proven tools for converting your projects into success (without a business plan).\"\nOverview.\nDescription.\nThe IpOp model is a project analysis and decision-making tool. It provides a framework to analyze and assess the benefits and feasibility of projects at the pre-project stage. IIt assumes that a more rigorous analysis at the pre-project stage helps better allocate resources. The claim is that proper early-stage calibration of projects will avoid wasting resources on projects that should not be undertaken or take more time and resources than expected. The IpOp model uses a generic decision tree to help decision-makers better manage their resources.\nTo achieve this early calibration, the IpOp model highlights the need to catalog as many unknowns as possible as early as possible. This early stage is called \u201cpre-project\u201d. It focuses on defining the unknowns that are missing information that may realistically be obtained. Identifying the unknowns leads to a more accurate estimate of the resources required to reduce key unknowns. The IpOp model has been designed to guide the innovators\u2019 analysis to identify as many unknowns as possible and obtain relevant answers to decision-makers\u2019 concerns. It also shows the complex interactions between all parameters that need to be considered in a project.\nTo be aligned with the logic of the IpOp decision tree for decision-makers Raphael H. Cohen suggests replacing the business plan by a two-parts approach:\nIpOp model decision tree.\nAccording to Moses, on average, decision-makers use six different criteria to evaluate projects, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 9 parameters. The IpOp model decision tree consists of 11 questions where the left column mentions where the answer to each question/decision criterion can be found in the IpOp model. In contrast, the right column indicates what the decision-makers should do if the answer is negative. Any organization can use this decision tree as a starting point and adapt it to its own circumstances and industry. More specific questions can be added to check the strategic fit. The author claims that using the IpOp model decision tree adds rigor to project management governance, especially in the pre-project stage.\nImportance of unknowns.\nA central characteristic of the IpOp model is the need to identify unknowns because every project has unknowns that express a lack of knowledge or understanding that may negatively affect the success of the project. For instance, ignoring the size of the addressable market represents a critical unknown. The price that customers would be willing to pay is another unknown. In addition to market-related unknowns, there can be technology-related unknowns, process-related unknowns, stakeholders-related unknowns, intellectual property-related unknowns, regulatory unknowns, etc. To reduce the ignorance resulting from the information gap that is expressed by the unknowns, tactical moves or initiatives can be done to obtain the missing information. For example, a doubt about the technical feasibility can be reduced by building a prototype (a tactical move). Another doubt on the product or price acceptability by customers can be reduced with help of a market study (tactical move).\nThe IpOp model helps identify and map as many unknowns as possible before significant resources (including time) are spent. Only once the key unknowns have been cataloged, and since each tactical move for reducing unknowns consumes resources (time, money, etc.), it is possible to assess the effort required to obtain the missing information as well as the most effective sequence of tactical moves for obtaining it. The author claims that this process allows for a more realistic calibration of the project.\nSuch method provides decision-makers with a clear view of resources required to first acquire missing information before deciding to launch the project. This means a better assessment of the time, money, and skills required to achieve the desired result. With a clearer understanding of the required effort, decision-makers can reject unnecessary initiatives that are not worth it and allocate resources more efficiently. This enhanced selection increases the success rate of projects delivering on time and on budget. This stringent selection process should also limit the number of projects that are launched but never completed.\nThe opportunity case.\nThe IpOp model encourages using an opportunity case, a document that addresses all the key issues that interest decision-makers without providing an implementation or action plan. The author makes the assumption that decision-makers are not concerned with the operational aspects of a project until they are convinced of how a project benefits them. This suggests that inundating them with implementation details, as is often the case in business plans, is unproductive as long as they are not convinced by the merits of the project. This led Raphael H. Cohen to use a two-step approach as an alternative to the traditional business plan:\nFirst, an opportunity case for decision-makers, with everything that is relevant for them except the action plan. Cohen believes that this document should not exceed 10 pages. It allows decision-makers to give a first approval on the opportunity.\nSecond, an action plan which describes the implementation of the project. This plan which complements the opportunity case, will only be read by decision-makers who have found the opportunity case convincing. They will use the action plan to assess how the opportunity will be implemented to deliver the promised outcome stated in the opportunity case (the definition of success).\nAccording to Cohen, this approach has multiple advantages over a business plan: as the opportunity case focuses on core decision-makers concerns without implementation details, it is much shorter (5 to 10 pages) than a business plan (30 to 50 pages). As a result, the IpOp analysis should be performed prior to developing an opportunity case or a business plan. Another benefit is that since the IpOp model helps identify unknowns it provides a more realistic assessment of the challenges and effort to address them.\nThe four IpOp reviews.\nThe IpOp model uses a sequential and iterative approach where each step is called \"IpOp review\" because it will most likely need to be revisited multiple times.\nThe iterative process explains why it is called \u201creviews\u201d rather than steps, which are perceived as final when they are completed. The four IpOp reviews have been designed to quickly eliminate projects that do not deserve to consume resources. The IpOp decision tree includes the four IpOp Reviews.\nThe sequential approach of the IpOp model differentiates itself from the phase-gate or stage-gate model because the latter was built to allocate resource step-by-step. As long as a \u201cgate\u201dhas not been validated, it is not possible to ask for additional resources for the next stage gate. To avoid resource waste, the IpOp model can be used before phase-gate process to calibrate project at a very early stage. As it identifies all critical unknowns early on, it helps select the most cost-effective sequence to obtain the missing information instead of always using the one-size-fits-all sequence of the phase-gate approach.\nAs the IpOp model should be used before resources are allocated, the four IpOp reviews can be analyzed without consuming significant resources. The four IpOp reviews only consume the time of the people doing the analysis at the pre-project stage. Significant resource consumption (time and money) only starts when tactical moves are launched to reduce unknowns.\nQuestions asked at each IpOp review are stated in a way that allows quick elimination of projects for which the answer is negative. Rigorous decision-makers require a positive response to each decision criterion. The project innovators\u2019 responsibility is to iterate and amend their project to transform every \u201cno\u201d into a \u201cyes\u201d for each question before submitting their project to investors or decision-makers.\nUsage.\nThe IpOp model has been taught in corporate executive education seminars, business schools and MBA programs targeting intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs. It has been field tested with over 250 intrapreneurial ventures, and adopted among multinational companies, such as Airbus, Nestl\u00e9, B\u00fchler, Sanofi-Aventis, Microsoft, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Oracle, ST Microelectronics, La Poste, Serono, Capgemini, Ernst &amp; Young.

Taft says that his aim is to record these women's contributions as he sees them as martyrs to changing ideas. In 1803 the annual Methodist Conference in Manchester had ruled that:\nThe text said \"[women should not preach]... 1. Because a vast majority of our people are opposed to it. 2. Because their preaching does not at all seem necessary, there being a sufficiency of preachers, whom God has accredited, to supply all the places in our connection with regular preaching. But if any woman among us think she has an extraordinary call from God to speak in public, (and we are sure it must be an \"extraordinary\" call that can authorize it,) we are of the opinion she should in general, address her own sex and those only: And upon this condition alone...\"\nThe instruction was said to result from the work that his wife was doing. His wife, with the support of other preachers, ignored the instruction. She was occupied being a preacher on the same circuit as her husband in Epworth. Mary and Zechariah have been described as the powerhouse behind women preaching. Their contacts included Eliza Wilson in Yorkshire, Mary Holder and in Madeley Mary Fletcher and Mary Tooth.\nContent.\nThe introduction explains the motives for the books production.\nThe biographies include those of Susanna Wesley, Mary Fletcher and Sarah Lawrance, Ann Gilbert (died 1795), Bathsheba Hall, Grace Reed, Sarah Grubb, Mrs Jewitt, Sarah Cox and dozens of others.", "__index_level_0__": 9836, "length": 377, "question": "Who wrote the book \"Biographical Sketches of the Lives and Public Ministry of Various Holy Women\"?", "answer": "Zechariah Taft", "prediction": "Question: Who wrote the book \"Biographical Sketches of the Lives and Public Ministry of Various Holy Women\"?\nAnswer: Zechariah Taft", "generated_answer": " Donna Tart\n\nQ: What did Car"}

It is traditionally pulled by members of the Royal Navy; when not in use, it is kept at the shore establishment HMS \"Excellent\". A smaller version, known as the Portsmouth Gun Carriage, has been used at the ceremonial funerals of several senior naval officers in the 20th century.\nManufacture.\nThe gun carriage is from a British Army Ordnance, BL, 12 pdr 6 cwt, MK II, gun and weighs .\nThe carriage was made by Vickers, Sons and Maxim in 1896 and entered storage at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, being recorded as No. 146. The carriage never saw active service, probably being retained as part of a reserve. Queen Victoria had seen a gun carriage used during the funeral of her son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and requested the same for her funeral.\nIn 1899 No. 146 was handed to the Royal Carriage Department for conversion for use in state funerals. A catafalque and rubber tyres were added but other fittings and fixtures were left unchanged.\nVictoria's funeral.\nThe carriage was used during the state funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. In the days after Victoria's death the carriage was issued to the X Battery of the Royal Horse Artillery (RHA). It was to carry the Queen's coffin from Windsor railway station to Windsor Castle, where it would be interred in the adjacent Royal Mausoleum at Frogmore on 2 February. \nAccording to the Naval Historical Society of Australia there are two accounts of the events that followed. According to a naval observer, Lieutenant Percy Noble, the RHA's horses had not been exercised while awaiting the Royal Train's arrival and were unhappy when the coffin was placed on the carriage. They are said to have reared up and threatened to topple the coffin. Noble stated that Prince Louis of Battenberg asked the Royal Navy party commander, Lieutenant Algernon Boyle, for his sailors to pull the carriage. \nThe army officer in charge of X Battery at the funeral, Lieutenant M.L. Goldie, stated instead that an eye hole on the carriage splinter bar broke when his horses moved off. Confusion followed as various officers and officials attempted to exert control over the situation that prevented him from carrying out immediate repairs.\nThe end result was that sailors of the Royal Navy pulled the carriage to Windsor Castle, with a team of sailors using improvised drag ropes, made up from the horse harnesses and the communication cord taken from the royal train. This started a tradition that has been upheld at all subsequent state funerals.\nLater history.\nAfter Victoria's funeral, the Royal Navy retained the carriage; they may have refused to return it to the army. The navy was formally given the carriage by George V in 1910. The carriage has since been used at the funerals of Edward VII, George V, George VI, Sir Winston Churchill, Lord Mountbatten, and Elizabeth II. It is stored at the shore establishment HMS \"Excellent\", near Portsmouth. The staff instructors' mess displays the ropes used at the funeral of Edward VII. In storage the carriage is moved slightly every seven days, to allow its wheels to turn by a quarter to prevent them from being deformed. The carriage, including its gun barrel, are regularly polished. The carriage is held at 24-hours readiness for service in a facility kept at a constant temperature of and between 40 and 70% humidity to hinder fungal growth.\nMost recently, the gun carriage made its first appearance in 43 years for the funeral procession from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey for the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II on 19 September 2022. It was transported by 138 naval ratings, with 98 pulling, in front of the carriage, and 40 behind, braking, with 4 officers walking alongside the 40 brakers, 4 officers walking alongside the pullers, and 2 further officers leading the 138. After the service at the abbey the carriage was used again, attended by 137 naval ratings (one having fallen ill), to carry the coffin to Constitution Hill where it was transferred to the state hearse for its journey from Wellington Arch to St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle for interment.\nPortsmouth Gun Carriage.\nA smaller gun carriage, called the Portsmouth Gun Carriage, is stored at , a shore establishment at Fareham in Hampshire, and has been used for eight ceremonial funerals of senior naval officers between 1935 and 1967. These include Earl Jellicoe, Earl Beatty, Sir Dudley Pound, and Viscount Cunningham. A plaque on the carriage records that it originally came from HMS \"Pembroke\" in Chatham, Kent, and was first used for the funeral of Sir Charles Madden at Westminster Abbey on 7 June 1935.

{"id": 74465611, "context": "Beatrice Green (; 1 October 1894 \u2013 19 October 1927) was a Welsh labour activist who was a key figure in the 1926 United Kingdom general strike and the subsequent miners' lockout. A highly-regarded orator and writer, she became a leader in the labour movement of South Wales and was a prominent member of the Labour Party in Monmouthshire.\nBiography.\nEarly life and entry into activism.\nBeatrice Dykes was born on 1 October 1894 in the town of Abertillery in Monmouthshire, Wales. The seventh of eight children of William and Mary Dykes, her father was a tin worker and coal miner. One of her brothers was killed in a mining accident in 1910. After attending the local church school, she enrolled in the Abertillery Grammar School. She later became a teacher, and was active in the Sunday school at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. On 22 April 1916, she married coal miner Ronald Emlyn Green, and despite being a well-regarded teacher, she was forced out of her job due to the United Kingdom's marriage bar.\nWith her husband's parents able to care for their two children, Green was able to become involved in labour activism beginning in the early 1920's. She gave her first known speech in January 1921 to the women's branch of the local Labour Party, in which she contested women's traditional roles in society, stating: \"For too long the idea has been allowed to circulate that woman's place is in the home, and man's in the world. With the inadequate measure of franchise, woman is realising that politics have a direct bearing upon her home, and that she has to get out in order to put things right\". The speech, titled \"Women in the State\", was later published in the local newspaper and garnered significant attention. Similarly to other female Labour activists in South Wales, Green \"did not call for radical transformation of gender roles in society. She did, however, believe that women should gain control over those areas of life which most concerned them and that to this end they should engage in public work on the same terms as men\".\nIn 1922, Green became the secretary of the local hospital's \"Linen League\", which consisted of a group of forty women who volunteered to wash and supply the hospital's linens. With much of its success attributed directly to Green, the league had organized into a social club by the following year, with an annual membership subscription and regular events. A \"fervent campaigner in favour of birth control\", Green and Marie Stopes led a successful push to establish a birth control clinic at the hospital, though it was forced to close after sixteen months due to \"intense opposition\" from the local clergy. During this period, she also began contributing to a French socialist magazine \u2014 she was fluent in the language \u2014 and wrote for the periodical \"Labour Woman in Britain\".\n1926 miners' lockout.\nNamed president of the Monmouthshire Labour Women's Advisory Council in 1926, Green played a significant role in that year's labour uprisings. After miners across South Wales began demanding better wages and a decrease in working hours, a lockout was initiated. In May 1926, the General Council of the Trades Union Congress declared a nationwide general strike to show solidarity with the miners. Though the general strike only held for nine days, the lockout continued for another six months. During the lockout, Green began fundraising for the Women's Committee for the Relief of Miners' Wives and Children (WCRMWC), which was later described as an \"industrial Red Cross\". A skilled orator, Green held several fundraising rallies in London on behalf of the WCRMWC, becoming a well-known public speaker. A significant portion of the organization's fundraising also came from miners in Canada and the Soviet Union.\nBecause there were few jobs in Abertillery outside of the mining industry, the town was devastated by the lockout, which plunged it \"into economic misery\". As part of the effort to relieve the economic strain on the town, Green and Elizabeth Andrews headed a program which temporarily fostered 2,500 vulnerable children from communities across the South Wales Coalfield for the duration of the lockout, easing \"the financial burden on their parents\". The pair personally led a group of fifty children from Abertillery, as well as the nearby towns of Dowlais and Merthyr Tydfil, directly to foster families in London. In addition, Green operated a soup kitchen in Abertillery, which fed up to 1,600 people per day. She also founded the Abertillery Maternity Relief Committee, which provided supplies for pregnant women and mothers, and advocated for maternity relief for imprisoned women. In July 1926, Green gave an interview to \"Labour Woman\", in which she described \"what it was like to be a mother of a large family without a waged income coming in\". Due to her orations and writing, she became well-known among political circles across the United Kingdom.\nSoviet Union tour, later activism, and death.\nFrom 27 August until 16 October 1926, Green was part of a nineteen-member delegation sent by the Miners' Federation of Great Britain to the Soviet Union; the trip was intended to cement relations between British and Soviet trade unions. The group travelled thousands of miles via rail between Leningrad and Tbilisi, visiting \"workplaces, clubs, hospitals and schools and exploring many aspects of Soviet life\". Green took particular interest in the coal mines of the Donets Basin, comparing the state-owned enterprises favorably to the privately-owned mines of Britain; they also visited the oilfields of Grozny. Large crowds received the group at every train station, with Green giving speeches to onlookers regarding the labour struggle in Britain. Though she was not a communist, Green highly praised the Soviet system in two reports published in \"Labour Woman\", in which she \"wrote particularly about women in the Soviet Union and was eager to draw favourable contrasts between Czarist Russia and what was happening in the workers' state\". Green also wrote that women in the Soviet Union had been emancipated and \"possess an absolute equality of rights with man\". Though she conceded that there were serious issues in regions like Azerbaijan, where \"male opposition to the new equality laws created serious tension and violence\", she also broadly praised the Muslim-majority areas, claiming that Muslim women had gained their own identities. These reports were later described as being \"somewhat na\u00efve\" in retrospect by historian Sue Bruley.\nAccording to fellow labour activist Marion Phillips, the Soviet trip was \"a crowning happiness in [Green's] life during which she blossomed as a speaker, writer and activist\". In November 1926, a month after her return, the lockout had largely ended, as the miners were \"deprived and starved into submission\". Despite this loss, Green continued her activism, writing frequent columns in the \"Labour Woman\", particularly about issues relating to child care and motherhood. The \"Dictionary of Labour Biography\" praised her writing style, stating: \"Her articles were written in a simple and accessible style in order to reach her intended \u2014 predominately working class \u2014 audience. Her approach was informative rather than preachy, practical rather than patronising. The words were those of a working-class woman who knew of the problems surrounding child rearing at a time when economic difficulties ensured there were shortages of all kinds\". In September 1927, she was the presiding officer of the Monmouthshire Labour Party women's conference, which was attended by over 800 delegates.\nGreen died of ulcerative colitis on 19 October 1927 at the hospital in Aberbeeg, aged just 32. Her young death was attributed to stress caused by the \"harshness and uncertainty\" of the period. She was buried at the Blaenau Gwent Church in Abertillery.

He was also previously editor-in-chief of Inq7.net, the former website of the Philippine Daily Inquirer.\nA number of his claims have been fact-checked by multiple organizations.\nCareer.\nTiglao was an activist during the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos. Tiglao was head of the Manila-Rizal chapter of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Tiglao was eventually caught along with his wife Raquel, and detained by Marcos' military forces, first at the 5th Constabulary Security Unit in Camp Crame and then at the Ipil Detention Center in Fort Bonifacio. He and his wife remained in detention for two years and were then let out on house arrest.\nHe later became a reporter for Business Day from 1981 to 1986. He then served as business editor and columnist at the Manila Chronicle from 1986 to 1989. His chapter on \"The Consolidation of Dictatorship\" in the 1988 book \"Dictatorship and Revolution: Roots of People's Power\" is cited as one of the accounts of precisely how Ferdinand Marcos consolidated power during the early years of his presidency.\nIn 1989, Tiglao was one of 9 journalists who founded the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ), an independent nonprofit media agency specializing in investigative reporting. He was the one who first proposed the creation of the PCIJ, writing a paper on this during his fellowship in 1988 at the Neiman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University and getting the idea after visiting the Center for Investigative Reporting in California.\nand he served as the PCIJ's treasurer in its earliest days, when it operated out of the PhP 1,000 chipped in by each of the founding members, and initial grants from The Asia Foundation and the Ford Foundation.\nFrom 1989 to 2000, he served as the Manila bureau chief and correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review. He became president of the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Association of the Philippines (FOCAP) from 1997 to 1998.\nTiglao became a columnist at the Philippine Daily Inquirer from 2000 to 2002 and from 2010 to 2013. He was also former editor-in-chief of Inq7.net (now \"Inquirer.net\"), the website of the Philippine Daily Inquirer.\nA year after the death of his first wife Raquel, he accepted the offer of the role of Press Secretary under Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo - taking over the role from her first Press Secretary, Noel Cabrera, in April 2002. Tiglao subsequently moved on to the roles of Presidential Spokesman, Presidential Chief of Staff, then head of Presidential Management Staff.\nExplaining his controversial decision to accept the post from Arroyo despite the reactions of his journalist colleagues, he explained his position saying: \"\"My framework has changed. It is not a matter of being an apologist. I've realized that particularly with President Gloria Arroyo, we're out to build a nation,\"\u201d and \"\"She has a real vision of creating a strong country. She is out to build a real strong state and a strong sense of nationalism. This vision has to be articulated and repeated.\"\u201d\nHe was eventually appointed by Pres. Arroyo as the Philippine Ambassador to Greece and Cyprus from 2006 to 2010. During the start of the Benigno Aquino III administration, Overseas Filipino Workers staged a protest in front of the Philippine Embassy in Athens, Greece to demand his removal due to accusations by them of \"dismal performance and a lavish lifestyle\". Tiglao declined to comment, stating that the matter was sensitive, and that he was on leave.\nAwards and recognition.\nTiglao was awarded the Best News Reporter by the Catholic Mass Media Awards in 1983. In 1991, he was awarded Best Economic Journalist for Asia by Mitsubishi Foundation. In 1992, he was named one of The Outstanding Young Men of the Philippines for Print Journalism by the Philippine Jaycees.\nFrom 1988 to 1989, he was a Nieman fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. In 2002, he became a fellow for the Center for Southeast Asia Studies at Kyoto University.\nControversies and fact-checks.\nSince the early 2010s, there have been incidents where assertions by Tiglao have generated controversy, have been refuted, and some fact-checked. Governance and foreign policy analyst Steven Feldstein notes how Tiglao, along with RJ Nieto and Sass Rogando Sasot are part of the Philippines' network of digital repression. They also noted that some members of the public tend to dismiss fact-checks done by traditional journalists because of people and columnists like Tiglao, who for example tags fact-checkers like Vera Files as \"a CIA-funded outfit.\"\nPersonal life.\nTiglao was first married to Raquel \"Rock\" Edralin, a women's rights advocate. He had three children with her. He became a widower when Edralin died of breast cancer in February 2001. His second wife is Gethsemane \"Getsy\" Selirio on April 13, 2002, who was editor in chief of Inq-7.", "__index_level_0__": 1477, "length": 814, "question": "What role did Rigoberto Tiglao serve under Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's administration?", "answer": "Presidential Spokesperson and Chief of Staff", "prediction": "Question: What role did Rigoberto Tiglao serve under Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's administration?\nAnswer: Presidential Spokesperson and Chief of Staff", "generated_answer": " 1st Deputy Attorney General; Vice President for Legal"}

{"id": 74636028, "context": "William J. Murphy (October 20, 1895 \u2013 April 28, 1973) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who was the president of Boston College from 1939 to 1945. Born in Massachusetts, he studied at Boston College for two years before entering the Society of Jesus in 1914. He studied philosophy at Woodstock College and theology at Weston College, and taught at Fordham University and the College of the Holy Cross. In 1934, he was placed in charge of overseeing the schools in the Jesuit province of New England.\nIn 1939, Murphy became the president of Boston College. His tenure coincided with World War II, during which the school hosted soldiers in the Army Specialized Training Program. Enrollment dropped significantly, requiring the college to fundraise to continue operating. In 1941, the Archbishop of Boston donated a large estate to Boston College. After the end of his presidency, Murphy became the dean of the Shadowbrook novitiate and was later an instructor of tertians in Connecticut.\nEarly life.\nMurphy was born on October 20, 1895, in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The youngest child of Michael J. and Joan Murphy, he had five siblings. Murphy studied at Lawrence High School, where he graduated in 1912 as the salutatorian. In 1912, Murphy enrolled at Boston College.\nJesuit formation.\nAfter his sophomore year, on September 7, 1914, Murphy entered the Society of Jesus and proceeded to the Jesuit novitiate of St. Andrew-on-Hudson. He studied languages and literature there from 1914 to 1917. In 1920, he began his philosophical studies at Woodstock College. Afterwards, Murphy spent one year teaching literature to freshmen at Fordham University in New York City, followed by three years teaching the classics at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. Murphy then studied theology at Woodstock for three years, and later transferred to Weston College. There, he was ordained a priest in June 1927.\nAfter his ordination, Murphy continued his theological studies at Weston College and also taught English to sophomores at Boston College. In 1930, he was sent for further education in Europe. He researched 18th-century literature for two years in Florence, Oxford, and London. Murphy then returned to Boston College, where he lectured at the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences on Dante Alighieri from 1932 to 1935.\nIn 1934, Murphy became the general prefect of schools of the Jesuits' province of New England. He worked with the leadership of Boston College and the College of the Holy Cross to remove both schools' requirement that students study Ancient Greek to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree, a decision that Boston College was reluctant to take. In 1937, he took on the additional role of assistant to the provincial superior.\nBoston College.\nOn August 15, 1939, Murphy was appointed to replace William J. McGarry, who left to lead a new Jesuit theological journal, as the president of Boston College. At the same time, Murphy replaced McGarry as the pastor of the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Chestnut Hill.\nJust sixteen days after Murphy assumed office, World War II began. The war put a significant strain on Boston College. In 1939, the school opened a civilian pilot training program in conjunction with the Civil Aeronautics Administration. The program operated for three years and nearly all of its graduates were commissioned as pilots in the Army or Navy. In October 1941, Boston College became the first school to participate in the federal government's Engineering, Science, and Management War Training program. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Murphy; the president of the College of the Holy Cross, Joseph R. N. Maxwell; and the Jesuit provincial superior, James H. Dolan, decided to create an accelerated curriculum to allow students to complete their education in two years before being conscripted into the armed forces. Boston College implemented this curriculum in January 1942. In 1943, the school joined the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) and St. Mary's Hall was converted from the Jesuit residence into barracks for 400 soldiers. In 1944, the ASTP was cancelled nationwide in anticipation of D-Day, and the army left campus on June 30, 1944. The significantly reduced study body put a substantial financial strain on the college, requiring it to begin a fundraising campaign in 1944 to allow it to continue operating. From 1944 to 1945, given a greatly increased enrollment at Boston College High School, part of Gasson Hall was used for high school classes.\nDuring Murphy's tenure, a program was created for Jesuits to study the classics, history, and the sciences at the graduate level. The school's football team also excelled, and Murphy celebrated the first Red Mass in Massachusetts on October 4, 1941, which was attended by many dignitaries. In 1941, the college acquired the estate of Louis K. Liggett, which included the mansion and of land. When Boston College asked the Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal William Henry O'Connell, for his approval of the purchase, he consented and paid for the estate for the college. The newly acquired building was named Cardinal O'Connell Hall and housed the College of Business Administration from 1941 to 1943. In September 1945, the school opened the Institute of Adult Education at Intown Center, which offered lectures in various courses, for which students did not receive academic credit.\nOn August 19, 1945, five days after the end of the war in the Pacific, Murphy's six-year term as president came to an end, in accordance with Jesuit custom. He was succeeded by William L. Keleher as president, and Thomas M. Herlihy as pastor of St. Ignatius Loyola Church.\nLater years.\nIn 1946, Murphy was appointed the dean of studies at the Shadowbrook novitiate in Lenox, Massachusetts. He then left in 1952 to become the instructor of tertians at St. Robert Bellarmine Hall in Pomfret, Connecticut, the tertianship center for the Jesuit province of New England.\nMurphy died on April 28, 1973, at Bon Secours Hospital in Methuen, Massachusetts.

{"id": 72577001, "context": "The Aesculapian Club of Edinburgh is one of the oldest medical dining clubs in the world. It was founded in April 1773 by Dr. Andrew Duncan. Membership of the club is limited to 11 Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and 11 Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. 'Extraordinary Membership' is given to members aged over 70 years. The club was established during the Scottish Enlightenment to encourage convivial relations between Fellows of the two Colleges and to stimulate intellectual discussion. The Club dinners are held in the New Library of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh on the 2nd Friday of March and October each year. The principal guest at each dinner is invited to give a short talk on a non-medical subject and this is followed by a round-table discussion.\nFounding members.\nThere were 10 founding members of the Club who attended the first dinner on 2 April 1773. The minutes of that meeting record that 'The Aesculapian Club was conceived in a happy moment, and in due time brought forth. Doctors Duncan and Hamilton, Messrs Hay, Bell, McLure, and Dewar assisted at the birth on the first Friday of April 1773. They also stood as godfathers at the christening. The usual rites and ceremonies usual on these occasions, such as eating a good supper, etc., were concluded with a bumper recommendatory of the club to the peculiar care of Apollo, of Bacchus, and of Venus, Floreat Res Medica. Vivat Veritas.' The club was named after Asclepius, the Greek God of medicine, more usually known by the Roman name, Aesculapius. Aesculapius was the son of Apollo, who was himself both the God of physic and the sender of disease. The badge of the Club consists of the Latin motto 'Floreat Res Medica' (Let the medical field flourish) and a cockerel. Cockerels adorn many of the fixtures and fittings of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. In Greek mythology cockerels were dedicated to Apollo (because their crowing gave notice of the rising sun) and to Aesculapius (because their example of 'early to bed and early to rise' was associated with good health). \nFormer members and previous meetings.\nThere have been 310 past and present members of the Aesculapian Club. Notable former Aesculpians include James Lind, Daniel Rutherford, Thomas Hope, James Syme, Sir James Young Simpson, Lord Joseph Lister, Joseph Bell, Douglas Argyll Robertson, Sir Thomas Clouston, Daniel Cunningham, James Haig Ferguson, Sir James Learmonth and Sir Stanley Davidson.\nA photograph or picture of Aesculapians from 1821 to the present day is preserved in a 2-volume album. The first volume, which extends to 1939, is kept with other historic papers of the club (including the minutes of previous meetings) in the library of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. The Club owns a considerable number of silver cups or \"pocula\" and other table adornments. These include six silver cups with circular rows of hooks, on each of which is hung a medallion with the engraved name, date of election and crest of a former Aesculapian. Three of these cups were presented by the Gymnastic Club (also founded by Dr. Andrew Duncan) on its dissolution in 1836. One of the cups, which contains 9 medallions from 1788 to 1792, is on display in the National Museums of Scotland.\nThe Aesculapian Club was originally a supper club and met on the first Friday of every month in local taverns. In 1810, it was converted into a dinner club, with quarterly meetings in March, June, September and December in Edinburgh hotels. In 1924, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh granted permission for the dinners to be held in the New Library. Although the frequency of dinners has been reduced over the years, the club has met almost continually since its inception. The only times when the Club did not meet were between March 1915 to December 1919 (due to the First World War), October 1939 to December 1945 (due to the Second World War) and March 2020 to October 2021 (due to the COVID pandemic).\nHonorary Secretary.\nThe Secretary of the Aesculapian Club acts also as the Treasurer and is responsible for the management of all affairs of the club. The Secretary is appointed \"ad vitam aut culpam\". There have been 16 secretaries of the club: Dr. Andrew Duncan (1773-1827); Dr. Richard Huie (1827-1842); Dr. Robert Omond (1842-1877); Dr. Daniel Rutherford Haldane (1877-1887); Dr. John Smith Jr. (1887-1905); Dr. Charles Edward Underhill (1905-1908); Sir George Andreas Berry (1908-1924); Dr. William Fordyce (1924-1933); Dr. William James Stuart (1933-1949); Lt-Col Alexander Dron Stewart (1949\u201355); Professor Robert William Johnstone (1955-1958); Dr. Clifford Kennedy (1958-1978); Iain MacLaren 1978\u20132004; Dr. Anthony 'Tony' Douglas Toft (2004-2014); Dr. Kelvin 'Kel' Palmer (2014-2022); Professor Mark William John Strachan (2022\u2013present).
