Tony Wong Chun-loong) created the company Jademan Holdings in 1971. In 1979 it became a formal corporation. The company was first listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1986. At one time 80% of the comics market in Hong Kong came from this company. It acquired 70% of \"Tin Tin Daily News\" in April 1987, and acquired money from that company. According to Monica Ko of the \"South China Morning Post\", because of Wong's profile in Jademan, the company's stock became known as \"personality stock\". Comics artist Ma Wing-shing worked for Jademan.\nBeginning in the 1980s, Jademan began distributing comics in North America. The initial comic had a printing of 50,000. At first the circulation of its comics was 20,000 total, made up of four titles. Ultimately, the company had six titles in North America. By August 1990, the North American total circulation had declined to 10,000.\nTony Wong held control until 1989, when he was removed. After Wong resigned, his involvement in the company's comics ended. Tony Zie became the new chairperson. As of January 1990, the company had 65% of the Hong Kong comics market, and it had 16 titles in Chinese published in Hong Kong. In August 1990 the company had 14 comic book titles in Hong Kong, and the combined circulation there was 1.45 million, making up 60% of the comic book market. In Summer 1990, Ma Wing-shing started a new job at Jonesky.\nIn May 1992 the company changed its name to Cultural Communications as a way to push itself away from Tony Wong, who later was convicted of an offence and imprisoned. This became shortened to CultureCom. Leung Kin-cheung, the assistant general manager of the company, announced an intention to make new comic books with a different readership instead of competing with Tony Wong, who created another company, Jade Dynasty Publications.\nSing Tao Holdings acquired 39% of the shares of the company circa the late 1980s/early 1990s.

{"id": 74695019, "context": "Slave markets and slave jails in the United States were places used for the slave trade in the United States from the founding in 1776 until the total abolition of slavery in 1865. \"Slave pens\", also known as slave jails, were used to temporarily hold enslaved people until they were sold, or to hold fugitive slaves, and sometimes even to \"board\" slaves while traveling. Slave markets were any place where sellers and buyers gathered to make deals. Some of these buildings had dedicated slave jails, others were \"negro marts\" to showcase the slaves offered for sale, and still others were general auction or market houses where a wide variety of business was conducted, of which \"negro trading\" was just one part. \nSlave trading was often done in business clusters where many trading firms operated in close proximity. Such clusters existed on specific streets (such as Pratt Street in Baltimore, Adams Street in Memphis, or Cherry Street in Nashville), in specific neighborhoods (for example, near, but not within, the French Quarter in New Orleans, and at Shockoe Bottom in Richmond), or in settlements seemingly dedicated to serving planters seeking new agricultural laborers (such as Forks of the Road market in Natchez, Mississippi, and at Hamburg, S.C., across the river from Augusta, Georgia). Many thousands of other sales took place on the steps of county courthouses (to satisfy judgments, estates and claims), on large plantations, or anywhere else there was a slave owner who needed cash in order to settle a debt or pay off a bad bet. It was not uncommon to hold sales or auctions outdoors in the pre-air-conditioning South; the plaza north of the Charleston Exchange may be the most enduring and notable of these locations.\nA slave market could operate without a dedicated jail, and a jail could operate without an associated market. For example, the St. Louis Hotel in New Orleans, and the Artesian Basin in Montgomery, Alabama, were important slave markets not known for their prison facilities. A number of slave jails in the Upper South were used for holding people until slave traders had enough for a shipment south, but were only rarely the site of slave sales, in part because the profit for the trader was sure to be higher in the Deep South, closer to the labor-hungry plantations of the cotton and sugar districts.\nHistory.\nDedicated marts, depots, and lockups were by no means ubiquitous, but the slave trade itself was: \"The slave trade took place in nearly every town and city in the South. In most, however, the trade did not have a permanent physical location. Commonly, slaves were sold on court days, usually outdoors at a location near the courthouse, yet those cities with a large slave market had a significant infrastructure dedicated to the buying and selling of humans.\"\nSlave traders traveled to farms and small towns to buy enslaved people to bring to market. Slave owners also delivered people they wanted to dispense with. Enslaved people were placed in pens to await being sold, and they could become quite crowded. In New Orleans, most sales were made between September and May. Buyers visited the slave pen and inspected enslaved people prior to the sale. People were held until their means of transportation was arranged. They were transported in groups by boat, walked to their new owners, or a combination of the two. They were moved in groups in a coffle. This meant that people were chained together with iron rings around their necks which were fastened with wooden or iron bars. Men on horseback herded the groups, or coffles, to their destination. They used dogs, guns, and whips. Railroads brought a new, simpler means of travel that did not rely on the use of coffles. In some cases, slave traders, like Franklin and Armfield Office, had a network of slave depots that were located along their routes.\nLumpkin's Jail, the largest in the state of Virginia, was a particularly inhumane place that resulted in people dying of starvation, illness, or beating. They were so cramped that they were sometimes on top of one another. There were no toilet facilities.\nSwedish writer Fredrika Bremer described slave pens she saw on her travels in America as \"great garrets without beds, chairs or tables.\" Per Frederic Bancroft, \"As a rule, in all such places, the floor was the only bed, a dirty blanket was the only covering, a miscellaneous bundle the only pillow.\nA negro mart was usually a type of urban retail market, usually consisting of a dedicated showroom and/or a workyard, a jail, and storerooms or kitchens for food. Negro marts were urban \"clearinghouses\" that both acquired enslaved people from more rural districts and sold people for use as farm labor. The term \"negro mart\" was most commonly used in Charleston, South Carolina, but can also be found in Memphis, Tennessee, multiple locations in Georgia, et al. In the 1850s, future Confederate military leader Nathan Bedford Forrest operated a heavily advertised negro mart on Adams Street in Memphis. In January 1860, the \"New York Times\" reported that the Forrest &amp; Jones negro mart in Memphis had collapsed and caught fire; two people died but the bills of sale for people, \"amounting in the aggregate to \" were salvaged.\nA description of \"the negro mart of Poindexter &amp; Little\" in New Orleans, Louisiana states: \"In this mart the Negroes were classified and seated on benches, as goods are arranged on shelves in a well-regulated store. The cooks, mechanics, farm-hands, house-girls, seamstresses, washwomen, barbers, and boys each had their own place.\" \nDuring the Civil War, Gideon J. Pillow wrote a complaint letter to the effect that federal troops had robbed him of his slaves and killed or jailed his overseers; he wanted someone to check if the women and children, particularly, were \"confined in the Ware house or Negro Mart.\"\nA lawsuit resolved in 1870 addressed the issue of debt for an enslaved person purchased on credit, after an insurance company refused to pay out on a property insurance claim, since the slave had committed suicide after being put in a slave mart in New Orleans. The court determined that the debt was still owed, but removed the interest payment obligation.\nAfter slavery.\nThe \"Smithsonian\" magazine states that \"[t]hese were sites of brutal treatment and unbearable sorrow, as callous and avaricious slave traders tore apart families, separating husbands from wives, and children from their parents.\" During the Civil War, slave pens were used by the Union Army to imprison Confederate soldiers. For instance, slave pens were used for this purpose in St. Louis, Missouri and Alexandria, Virginia. In Natchez, Mississippi, the Forks of the Road slave market was used by the Union soldiers to offer the formerly enslaved protection and freedom. In 2021 the site was made part of the Natchez National Historical Park.\nOld slave pens were also repurposed for worship and education. In Lexington, Kentucky, Lewis Robards' slave jail was used as a Congregational church by African Americans. A freedmen's seminary, now Virginia Union University, was established in Lumpkin's Jail.

Hoffmann, which was first published on 31 March 1813 in the \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\" and later republished in Hoffmann's 1814 collection \"Fantasiest\u00fccke in Callots Manier.\"\nThe story is told in the first person by a traveller who describes his experience watching Mozart's opera \"Don Giovanni\" in a theatre adjacent to his hotel.\nPlot summary.\nA waiter draws the traveller's attention to a door in his hotel room, which leads directly into room 23, the \"Fremdenloge\" (literal translation: \"stranger box\") of a theatre which attaches to the hotel. In the theatre, Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" is being performed. The traveller sits in his box and enjoys the opera, with which he is very familiar. Whilst he sits there engrossed in the performance and his own thoughts, he feels that someone has come into his box. He decides not to turn around, as he does not want to be distracted from the poetic-musical exaltation he is experiencing. During the interlude, the traveller turns around and sees that the stranger is Donna Anna, a character from \"Don Giovanni\". The traveller and Donna Anna talk in Tuscan about the opera; she offers insight which makes the narrator see the opera in a new light. The woman uses the \"du\" form and calls the traveller by his name. \nDonna Anna disappears and the opera resumes. The narrator is satisfied with the rest of the performance. Afterwards, he goes to dine in the hotel restaurant and overhears other audience members discussing the performance; they do not rate it highly, and focus on the appearances of the actors. The narrator retreats to his room. He re-enters the box of the theatre and calls down to the empty stage: \"Donna Anna!\". Anna then appears to the narrator a second time. At two o'clock, the narrator thinks he hears Donna Anna's voice talking to him. \nThe following noon, at the hotel restaurant, the narrator and hotel guests discuss the death of the signora who played Donna Anna.\nAnalysis.\n\"Don Juan\" has spawned many different interpretations, although most critics accept that the story plays out on two \"diametrically opposed planes\"; that of the opera and that of the real world outside. These two worlds cross over when Donna Anna appears to the narrator in his box, and the narrator finds himself implicated in the drama himself.\nThe tale has strong Romantic themes \u2014 the narrator, himself an artist, finds no comfort in the world of philistines in which he finds himself (as represented by the other hotel guests), and the experience of finding a soul mate in Donna Anna is \"almost overwhelming\". Donna Anna is, to Birgit R\u00f6der, \"an example of the extreme Romantic individual who can find fulfilment only in death\".", "__index_level_0__": 4979, "length": 457, "pred": {"ppl": 7.066968441, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0064503097, "ppl/zlib": 0.0014813876, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.7449092024, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.5465766121, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.0005267753, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.9786575133, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.1930472833, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.5956332575, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.132758017}, "question": "What is the name of the opera that the narrator watches in \"Don Juan\"?", "answer": "Don Giovanni", "prediction": "Question: What is the name of the opera that the narrator watches in \"Don Juan\"?\nAnswer: Don Giovanni", "generated_answer": " \"Le Noz\u00e9ral\" by Gabriel F"}

{"id": 72263763, "context": "The building that is referred to as the Priests' House, or House of Priests, at Dura-Europos near the village of Salhiyah in eastern present-day Syria, is one of three buildings that was excavated in block H2. It is hypothesized to be the home of priests from the Temple of Atargatis based on its proximity to the two neighboring temples and graffiti found in the third Excavation season. \nDiscovery.\nThe House of Priests was excavated between 1929 and 1930 under French archeologist and Egyptologist Maurice Pillet, who was then Field Director of the excavation at Dura-Europos on the Syrian Euphrates, during the third expedition to the site. Pillet's two assistants, Andr\u00e9 Naudy and Henry T. Rowell, took over the direction of the campaign after he fell ill and left the site in January 1930. The excavations of block H2 were disturbed by heavy rains in January and February 1930, especially since the temples and the house were on a low level which left them susceptible to flooding. To remedy this, the team built an embankment southwest of the block to prevent flooding and subsequently rebuilt it three times.\nThe house is located on the southeastern corner of block H2, which it shares with the Temple of Atargatis and the Temple of Artemis. This closeness to the two temples along with evidence of a joint upper level lead to its classification as a place of residence for the priests of the Temple of Atargatis.\nArchitectural structure.\nThe house is 440.5 m2 and has a total of 15 rooms with one entrance at H2-D6. There is no evidence of when the house was constructed.\nAt the time of discovery the four courtyards, H2-D1, H2-G1, H2-F1, and H2-D'5, provided reason to believe that the unit contained four homes, but upon further excavation, all of the houses had connecting doorways except for H2-F, which was formerly connected but was later blocked off and separated. These connections, along with two separate external doors in the larger home, imply that the residents were able to convene without having to exit the home, which implies that they had relationships between households.\nAmong the other evidence that is referenced when referring to this building as the House of Priests is the character of the building. It is large, including two stories, multiple courtyards, and a fresco that was believed to depict a funerary scene. Also, there was formerly a door connecting the house to the Temple of Atargatis that had been barricaded, and walls that are thought to have supported a passage on an upper floor. The small walls between the temple and the house have also been speculated to have constructed to keep out animals, though this would be an unlikely function in a place so sacred and small. The passage between the temple and the house is believed to have been constructed after an earthquake in A.D. 160, replacing some of the footprint of the house. While the doors that border the external streets are on the same level, the passages within the block are 0.70 m. to 1 m. above the levels of the floors and the street.\nThe graffiti discovered in the vestibule of the house includes animals, people, and architectural forms such as the city gate and walls. Also, a fresco stele on the southeast wall of room H2-O was discovered in somewhat poor condition but is believed to depict a funerary repast scene. The relief is 0.55 m. x 0.40 m. and is 0.60 m. above the floor. The stele depicts three figures, one lying on a bed, one presenting an offering, and one more barely decipherable figure as well as a possible thymiateria. This imagery is seen throughout Dura-Europos and Graeco-Roman antiquity, most notably in the temple of the Palmyrene gods.\nThe house is ornate, and similar in size to those of wealthy families, yet no precious art was found in it, further alluding to its function as a dwelling of notable, but not aristocratic, people. At the time of discovery, only one external door of the House was found, which signifies that the residents were of a class that is intentionally separated from the exterior world. Also, there was an oven and a kneading trough discovered in room H2-D10, implying the existence of a bakery room within the building. H2-G7 has a door from a somewhat isolated room to the street, as does H2-G6 right next to it, which poses the possibility of a shop that is connected to the house.\nFindings.\nAmong the finds at the House of Priests was one of four versions of a painted plaster relief depicting the Greek goddess Aphrodite in a niche. The relief, dated from 113 B.C.\u2013A.D. 256 and measuring 11 7/8 in. \u00d7 12 in. \u00d7 3 1/4 in., depicts the goddess standing nude under an arch and was found in two fragments, split horizontally into two halves. She holds a mirror in her left hand and fixes her hair with her right, similar in form to Praxiteles' Aphrodite of Arles. Other similar reliefs were found, one with nearly the same dimensions and depicting the same figure and scene, one fragment of the bottom portion of the relief with similar dimensions, and one inconclusive relief that has since been lost but maintains the clearest outline of the figure's right hip. The primary evidence that these reliefs were made from the same mold is that they all depict details of the anklets around the figure's legs and the columns framing the figure. Additionally, the mold was likely worn down, as all figures are somewhat indistinct.\nOne of the other versions of this relief was found in block G5-C2 in a building that was believed to be a brothel. The significance of this relief is contested, as Greek religion was not thought to be surviving at Dura-Europos, evidenced by a lack of architecturally Greek temples. However, Aphrodite and Hercules were the two most depicted Greco-Roman deities and Aphrodite is hypothesized to have been worshipped domestically. Further, figural nudity was rarely depicted in Parthian art and the voluptuousness of the figure alludes to Greek influence, so the relief has been classified as a depiction of Aphrodite.\nThirty nine lamps were found in room O of the house as well as a stele measuring 0.55 m. x 0.40m.\nEvidence of local production was found in the House. A steatite mould with a similar lead \"patera\" were discovered, implying that mould was used in production.", "__index_level_0__": 3486, "length": 1064, "pred": {"ppl": 8.5428943634, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0041172728, "ppl/zlib": 0.0007953652, "Min_5.0% Prob": 9.1332264662, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.7902188212, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.1860517557, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.2246990432, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.5151719958, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.9328049019, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.4470344591}, "question": "What was the primary function of the House of Priests in Dura-Europos?", "answer": "A dwelling place for priests from the Temple of Atargatis.", "prediction": "Question: What was the primary function of the House of Priests in Dura-Europos?\nAnswer: A dwelling place for priests from the Temple of Atargatis.", "generated_answer": " a) as the centrist b) as the"}

The NFB initiated the project after having some success repackaging its 1962 film \"Drylanders\" as a set of shorter films for classroom use, and decided in the early 1970s to experiment with making new films that were designed for that dual use from the outset.\nOther films in the series included Bernard Devlin's \"A Case of Eggs\", Rudi Dorn's \"A Moving Experience\", John Howe's \"A Star Is Lost!\" and Michael Scott's \"The Winner (Albert la grenouille)\", although \"Heatwave\" was the only one of the five newer films that was relatively well received by critics or audiences.\nJackson noted that one of the key limitations imposed by the educational aspect of the film's mandate was that even though the film was set in Montreal, he was unable to depict any characters speaking with a French Canadian accent.\nDistribution.\nThe film premiered on April 28, 1975, as an episode of the ABC late-night anthology \"Wide World of Entertainment\". It was promoted as the first Canadian feature film ever sold to network television in the United States. It received strong ratings in that broadcast, with ABC purchasing rights to rerun it later in the year.\nIt was later broadcast by CBC Television in Canada on August 10.\nReception.\nThe film was submitted to the 26th Canadian Film Awards.

It ran on ABC from October 27, 1949, until July 12, 1950. The program featured comedy, music, and participation by viewers.\nContent.\nEpisodes of \"A Couple of Joes\" included singing, instrumental music, and segments with prizes for viewer participation. The latter included bringing in items like a mustache cup and high-button shoes; viewers calling in musical requests, hoping to stump the two Joes by naming tunes that they could not play; and hosts calling viewers with quiz questions.\nPersonnel.\nInitially, Joe Bushkin and Joe Rosenfield were co-hosts of the program. Others featured included Joan Barton, Allyn Edwards, Beryl Richards, and Pat Harrington. Music was provided by Milton DeLugg's orchestra in 1949 and Mike Reilly's orchestra and Bobby Sherwood's orchestra in 1950. By the first episode of 1950, Warren Hull had replaced Rosenfield on the show. \nThe show also included Morgan, a basset hound who belonged to the producer. \"Life\" magazine featured the dog in a story and photographs in its March 27, 1950, issue, reporting that Morgan was a \"3-year-old pedigreed basset hound called J. J. Morgan, though his real name is Sir Guy Elwell\". On \"A Couple of Joes\", a voice supposed to be that of Morgan made jokes while people talked and bands played. The article in \"Life\" described those comments as \"a blend of critical disdain worthy of George Jean Nathan and Queen Victoria\". The dog also appeared on other TV programs.\nProduction.\nThe program originated at WJZ-TV in New York City and was produced by World Video, Incorporated. Producers were Ed Kenner and Allen Kent, and Bobby Doyle was the director. Sponsors included Blatz Brewing Company. Tom Shirley was the announcer.\nCritical reception.\nA review of the program's August 19, 1949, episode in the trade publication \"Billboard\" compared the broadcast to \"a chaotic dress rehearsal\". Reviewer June Bundy commented, \"Musical portions of the show were vastly superior to the giveaway portions\", describing the latter as \"all very confusing\". She complimented Bushkin for his performances on the piano and his work as master of ceremonies. In contrast, she wrote that Rosenfield's \"harassed expression, nervous mannerisms and heavy-handed attempts at comedy were embarrassing to both cast and viewer\".", "__index_level_0__": 2012, "length": 374, "pred": {"ppl": 8.6508769989, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -0.9994895097, "ppl/zlib": 0.00170701, "Min_5.0% Prob": 9.1992571892, "Min_10.0% Prob": 8.0872581467, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.6206152611, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.5609866948, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.7126049895, "Min_50.0% Prob": 4.0464681794, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.5142880541}, "question": "Who were the co-hosts of the television program \"A Couple of Joes\"?", "answer": "Joe Bushkin and Joe Rosenfield", "prediction": "Question: Who were the co-hosts of the television program \"A Couple of Joes\"?\nAnswer: Joe Bushkin and Joe Rosenfield", "generated_answer": " Eric von Edten and Arthur happens Callender\n"}

Tanner painted Salome as part of his Christian-themed paintings.\nThe painting was unusual for Tanner, a \"marked departure for the usually reserved artist\". Although he did draw nudes as part of his studies, few of his professional paintings feature nudity. This particular painting is even more rare for being perceived as erotic. In this work the eroticism is offset by the bloody head of John the Baptist. Further, Salome is herself decapitated in this painting by shadow.\nThe work may have been influenced by the works of El Greco. Tanner and his wife Jessie spent several months in Granada in the beginning of 1903, where he had time to study El Greco's paintings. The result on some of his own paintings (including \"Salome\") was his use of the \"elongated figure style of El Greco\".\nThe painting was admitted into the 1921 Paris Salon. The painting was also displayed in 1924, as part of a solo exhibition put on by Tanner at Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City.\nThe painting was dontated to the Smithsonian's Museum of African Art by Henry's son Jessy O. Tanner in 1975.\nSymbolism.\nFarisa Khalid wrote of another Tanner painting, \"Looking closely at the painting, we have to ask ourselves what was the artist thinking in choosing to paint this dramatic scene in blue.\" Applied to \"Salome\", context indicates that here, in a scene in which Salom\u00e9 preformed an act of evil and killed a holy man, Tanner's blue may symbolize holy judgement, horror of the consequences of sin, and death.\nTanner imitated art movements, experimenting with his paintings. He would be known as a symbolist, as well as painter of religious art, impressionist and realist or genre painter. In Salom\u00e9 he used the same colors as \"The Sin\" by Franz von Stuck, blue over nudity, face in shadow, red-brown (a head in \"Salom\u00e9\") in a corner.\nIn other works, Tanner users warm colors to indicate holiness, such as Jesus face in \"Nicodemus and Jesus\", Jesus' robes in \"The Resurrection of Lazarus\", and Jesus and the disciples in \"The Disciples at Emaus\".

{"id": 73971107, "context": "Crotalaria similis, also known as the Pingtung Curara pea, belongs to the family Fabaceae and genus \"Crotalaria\". It is a perennial crawling herb, an endemic species of Taiwan which the distribution is limited to the Eastern seaside of the Hengchun Peninsula.\nDescription.\n\"Crotalaria similis\" is a small herb with dense layer of soft hair. Its height is between and grows on a sloping land. It has near sessile simple leaf. The leaf is in oval to egg shaped with length between and width between , pointy tips and no stipula. It has a terminal raceme inflorescence of 3-5 flowers, or as a solitary flower. At the base of the calyx, there is 2 pieces of bracteoles. The calyx has a 6mm length with bifid top but slightly connate. It has a dense layer of hair. The yellow corolla and the calyx are equal length. The stamen has a dimorphipic anther. The morphology of the exine is the shape of round pores to fine perforating striae. Their pollens are the same, approximately 20\u03bc in size with tricolporate shape. The outer fruit is in the shape of long-circular pods, 1cm in length. Each pod contains between 10-22 seeds.\nClassification.\nThe first naming and publishing of \"Crotalaria similis\" was done in 1895 by William Botting Hemsley, in the \"Annals of Botany\". He followed Augustine Henry's plant specimen descriptions over the new species accordingly, and \"Crotalaria similis\" was amongst it (sample specimen number 252 as evidence). Hemsley believed that the morphology of this species is like \"Crotalaria perpusilla\" Collett &amp; Hemsl which is originated from Myanmar. However, the leaf of this species is narrower.\nDistribution and the habitat.\n\"Crotalaria similis\" is a rare species with the narrowest distribution amongst the endemic \"Crotalaria\" plants in Taiwan. Its distribution can only be found in the open grass along the East coast of Kenting below 100 above sea level. There are 2 larger distribution center, one group situated in the Fengchuisha, Hengchun Peninsula which takes up 50% of the entire population, and the other group at the grassland of Longpan, which takes up 30% of the total population. There are several types habitat, including the calcareous red earth, sand, grasslands, and others. Amongst them, \"Crotalaria similis\" is mostly found in the grasslands, next is the sands and least being the calcareous red earth. Excessive human interference, such as afforestation, artificial planting, trample and other apparent ways resulting in the disappearance of the groups. However, limited interference, such as grazing benefit their survival.\nArtificial breeding and utilization.\nAs \"Crotalaria similis\" has a very restricted habitat, it is scarce in number and is an endangered species. It is not being cultivated and utilized. However, \"Crotalaria pallida\" Ait. var. obovata (G. Don) Polhill., \"Crotalaria zanzibarica\" Benth. and so forth that also belongs to the \"Crotalaria\" can be used as medicine.

She was instrumental in the creation of one of Gordon's masterworks, \"United States\", putting together a consortium of 27 arts institutions in 17 states to fund and collaborate on the piece, which took on distinctly different forms in every venue in which it was performed. Acknowledging her role in the creation of the project, Gordon referred to Dissette as the \"tiger in [his] office\". The \"United States\" project was seen by Peter Pennekamp of the Inter-Arts Program of the National Endowment for the Arts as a new model for financing new works and their tours, especially in dance. It provoked the Endowment to create a new funding category \"Partnerships in Touring and Commissioning\".\nIn 1991, Dissette became the Executive Producer of the PBS national arts anthology TV series \"Alive from Off Center\" \u2013 which was later renamed \"Alive TV\" \u2013 based in Minneapolis, Minnesota with Twin Cities Public Television. In this role, she produced over 30 episodes pairing cutting-edge filmmakers and multidisciplinary artists to provide the program with \"an aesthetic integrity and a visual coherence that it had never enjoyed before\", according to \"The New Yorker\". In an interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Dissette described her mission at \"Alive from Off Center\" as being \"to make performance art on television its own art form,\" and said that she sees herself as more of a collaborator than a boss. \"[I]f there is going to be a mistake, I would rather it be with somebody who is talented,\" she said.\nNotable films presented by the program under Dissette include \"Praise House\" (1991), \"Words in Your Face\" (1991), \"Ambition\" (1992), \"Punch and Judy Get Divorced\" (1992), and \"Seven Deadly Sins\" (1993).\nDissette was Director of \"New Voices, New Visions\", one of the first international digital artworks competitions; sponsored by Paul Allen, the CD-ROM publisher Voyager Company, and Wired magazinewith winning artist works presented by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. \nIn 2002, Dissette returned to the Pick Up Performance Co. to continue producing the work of David Gordon \u2013 as well as that of his son, writer/actor/director Ain Gordon \u2013 raising funds, coordinating logistics and providing marketing for nearly 50 productions at such venues as the Barbican Centre in London; the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), The Kitchen and the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York; the UCLA Center for the Art of Performance, the Krannert Center of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and other major universities and performing arts venues in the United States.\nDissette has served on the Board of Directors of Dance/USA, the Alliance of Resident Theatres/New York (ART/NY) and ODC in San Francisco. She has worked with artists such as filmmakers Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, and Fran\u00e7ois Girard, visual artist James Turrell, author Art Spiegelman, and in the performing arts, choreographer Sir Richard Alston, dancer/producer Mikhail Baryshnikov, director and writer Karin Coonrod, composer Philip Glass, singer Nona Hendryx, performance artist John Kelly, dance companies Urban Bush Women, ODC San Francisco, and director Robert Wilson. \nBeginning in 2014, Dissette initiated the transfer of David Gordon's extensive archives to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. Gordon did not want a \"boring and tedious\" archive, but desired a \"living archive\" which moved across different formats, so in addition to the papers, photographs and mementos documented by archivist Patsy Gay, which went into the library's permanent collection and online, Dissette worked with the Library to enable Gordon to create a series of performances called \"Live Archiveograpahy\" which were presented in the Library's Bruno Walter Auditorium, and later at The Kitchen and elsewhere. He also designed a exhibition for the Library called \"David Gordon: Archiveography \u2014 Under Construction\" which \"The New York Times\" called \"a manic and magical installation [which is] like standing in the middle of a collage.\" The final part of the archive is a website, \"Archiveography - Under Construction\", written in large part by Gordon but compiled, formatted and edited by Dissette, Gay and Jan Schmidt, a former curator for the Library.

{"id": 71632021, "context": "The Proto-Cuneiform script was used in Mesopotamia from roughly 3300 BC to 2900 BC. It arose from the token based system used in the region for the preceding millennia and was replaced by the development of early Cuneiform script in the Early Dynastic I period. While the underlying language of Cuneiform is definitively Sumerian, the language base for Proto-Cuneiform is as yet uncertain.\nHistory.\nBeginning around the 9th millennium BC a token based system came into use in various parts of the ancient Near East. These evolved into marked tokens and later marked envelopes, often called clay bullae. It is usually assumed that these were the basis for the development of Proto-Cuneiform as well as Proto-Elamite (with many of the tokens, about 2/3, having been found in Susa). Tokens remained in use after the development of Proto-Cuneiform and Proto-Elamite.\nThe earliest tablets found in the region are of a \"numerical\" type containing only lists of numbers. They are found not only at Susa and Uruk but in a variety of sites including those without later Proto-Elamite and Proto-cuneiform tablets, like Tell Brak, Habuba Kabira, Tepe Hissar, Godin Tepe and Jebel Aruda. Proto-Cuneiform emerged in the Uruk IV period, circa 3300 BC and continued through the Uruk III times. The script slowly evolved over time with signs changing and merging. It was initially used in Uruk, later spreading to a few additional sites like Jemdet Nasr.\nFinally, in the Early Dynastic I (c. 2900 BC) period the standard Cuneiform script, in the Sumerian language, emerged though only about 400 tablets have yet been recovered from this period, mainly from Ur with a few from Uruk.\nLanguage.\nThere is a longstanding debate in the academic community on when Sumerians came to Mesopotamia. This is partly driven by various linguistic arguments but also because a number of fundamental changes occurred in Mesopotamia, such as the plano-convex brick, at the same time as the Sumerian language definitively appeared in ED I. There are no clear clues in Proto-Cuneiform which has not prevented much speculation about the underlying language. Different languages have been proposed though often Sumerian is assumed.\nCorpus.\nAbout 170 similar tablets from Uruk V (circa 3500 BC) Susa and a few other sites in Iran like Tepe Sialk are considered as pre-proto-Elamite though with similarities to Proto-Cuneiform. Sign lists and transliterations are less clear for this category.\nLike Proto-Elamite this writing system was a relatively isolated phenomenon. The vast majority of Proto-Cuneiform texts, about 4000, have been found at archaic Uruk, though in secondary contexts in the Eanna district. The tablets fall primarily into two styles, an earlier (building level IV) set with more naturalistic figures and written with a pointed stylus, and a later (building level III) in a more abstract style using a blunt stylus. These correspond to the Late Uruk (c. 3100 BC) and Jemdet Nasr (c. 3000 BC) periods. Many had been used as fill for the foundation in the construction of the Uruk III Eanna temple complex. It appears that the records were of a short term nature and were quickly disposed of. The difficult stratigraphy has brought about a change from referring to tablets based on excavation layer to one of calling them script phase IV and III. Similarly to the tablets clay seals, used to secure vessels and doors, ended up in the fill after being removed. The findspots and analysis of sealing has led to suggestions that the tablets originated elsewhere and ended up at Uruk, where they were discarded.\nA smaller number of tablets were found in Jemdet Nasr, Khafajah and Tell Uqair. They tend to be less fragmentary and are sometimes found in stratified contexts. Some tablets have also made their way into various private and public collections. The provenance for some can be determined from internal clues but the origin city of some is unknown. For example, in 1988 82 complete well-preserved tablets from the Swiss Erlenmeyer Collection in Basel were auctioned off with most ending up in public collections.\nA notable pictographic examplar is a find by Langdon during his excavation in the 1920s. It is often called the \"Kish Tablet\". A plaster-cast of the artifact is today in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum and the original is in the Baghdad Museum. Its dating is unclear.\nSome tablets had been sealed using a cylinder seal.\nState of decipherment.\nTo decipher an unknown fully functional writing system it is desirable to know the underlying language encoded, to have bilingual examples, and to have a large corpus of texts. For Proto-cuneiform the language is unknown, there are no bilingual texts, and the corpus is rather small. Fortunately Proto-Cuneiform is not a full writing system but rather a simple system for economic administration. Text are basically so many cows or so much wheat or lists of items.\nAlready in 1928 with the first publication of Proto-Cuneiform texts a numerical sign list had been developed based on the assumption they were the same signs as those from the earliest cuneiform texts, those from Fara. It was then quickly determined that the sexagesimal and area numbers were also essentially the same as for early Cuneiform. The Proto-Cuneiform (and Proto-Elamite) mathematical system was largely worked out beginning in the 1970s. Within a few decades the details had been mostly worked out. Some details remain to be determined and a few generally agreed on details are controversial. As an example the (\u0160E system E) is thought to be a capacity but it has been pointed out that this measurement system is only found in the early Uruk IV layers and not the in the later Uruk III layers and does not have the markers of a capacity measure.\nSign Inventory.\nCurrently there are about 2000 known Proto-Cuneiform signs of which about 350 are numerical, 1100 are individual ideographic and 600 are complex (combination of 2 or more individual signs) signs. The non-numerical signs are attested in about 40,000 occurrences. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in sign usage. About 530 signs are only attested once, about 610 two to ten times, 370 attested 11 to 100 times, and about 104 signs attested more the 100 times. Many signs have been identified including those for barley and emmer wheat.\nNumbers.\nThe underlying basis of the proto-cuneiform, like the later cuneiform, is sexagesimal (base 60). Earlier researchers believed that this system rose out of an earlier decimal (base 10) substratum but that idea has now lost currency.\nDifferent products used different measurement systems and this can change with the context. In a single tablet the (Bisexagesimal System B) could be used for grain rations, (\u0160E system \u0160) could be used for barley, and (\u0160E system \u0160\") be used for emmer wheat. Some of the measurement systems, such as (\u0160E system C), which was for capacity, typically of grain. There are thirteen numerical systems in total (Sexagesimal, Sexagesimal S', Bisexagesimal, Bisexagesimal B*, GAN2, EN, U4, \u0160E, \u0160E', \u0160E\", \u0160E*, DUGb, DUGc) of which the contemporary Proto-Elamite writing system used only seven. Proto-Elamite also only used half of the sixty Proto-Cuneiform numerical signs.\nTexts.\nAdministrative.\nThe largest group of proto-cuneiform texts (about 2000 from the Uruk IV period and about 3600 from the Uruk III period) are accounts ie \"economic records\". They involve a variety of items including people, livestock, and grain. Unfortunately there are often multiple ways to do things. For example people can be listed two different ways 1) By gender and age (adult, minor, baby) or 2) without gender and in one of a number of age groups (0\u20131, 3\u201310 etc).\nNon-Adminstrative.\nAnother large category (around a dozen in Uruk IV and about 750 for Uruk III)) are called \"lexical lists\" started appearing in Uruk IV but became much more common in Uruk III times. These are list of all metals or a list of all tools or all cities etc. The genre persisted into Early Dynastic and Old Babylonian times.\nPublication.\nThe proto-cuneiform texts from Uruk were published in a series of books (ATU)\nAnd from other sites (MSVO)\nUnicode.\nA Unicode font set is under development for Proto-Cuneiform.

The album was recorded five years after the group's debut album, and roughly a year prior to the departure of Moholo-Moholo, who moved back to his native South Africa in September 2005 after years of exile in England.\nReception.\nIn a review for AllMusic, Fran\u00e7ois Couture wrote: \"Though the music is free to (and does) go anywhere, the listener usually knows what to expect -- and \"Naan Tso\" does not disappoint: dynamic playing, fierce exchanges between tenor sax and piano, delicate work from bass and drums, and a willingness to share collective fun with the listener.\"\nThe authors of \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\" awarded the album a full 4 stars, and stated: \"The music is full of exuberant energy, but with a sepia glaze that is redolent of sorrow and loss as well... while the main axis of energy seems to come from saxophone and drums... Edwards and Beresford play their full and subtle part in this.\"\n\"The Guardian\"'s John Fordham called the album \"fierce free-jazz, but majestically compelling,\" and commented: \"the constant urging of Moholo's swing, the splashy high-note effects of Beresford and the elemental roar of Edwards' bass provides a dramatic landscape for Parker's restlessly inventive journeys.\"\nJohn Eyles of \"One Final Note\" noted that the musicians \"are as wily an improvising foursome as one could hope to encounter,\" and remarked: \"Although recorded in the studio, these performances have the energy and spontaneity of a live gig... [Parker's] stream of invention... is so relentless as to make one's head reel, and the only way to appreciate it is to surrender and be swept along. The music often feels as much free jazz as improv, despite all four players being equal and unconstrained; the key to this seems to lie with Moholo, whose playing brings a subtle pulse that provides momentum, maybe even discipline.\"\nTrack listing.\nMusic by Evan Parker, John Edwards, Louis Moholo, and Steve Beresford.", "__index_level_0__": 10460, "length": 362, "pred": {"ppl": 7.6741552353, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -0.9987991854, "ppl/zlib": 0.0017067489, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.4319899934, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.299129553, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.0205464944, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.1003125637, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.37338108, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.7884035556, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.3007905911}, "question": "Who recorded the album \"Naan Tso\"?", "answer": "Foxes Fox", "prediction": "Question: Who recorded the album \"Naan Tso\"?\nAnswer: Foxes Fox", "generated_answer": " X\n\nQ: Did Santa Claus Make Me"}

{"id": 72150881, "context": "\"Treehouse of Horror XXXIII\" is the sixth episode of the thirty-fourth season of the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\", and the 734th episode overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on October 30, 2022. The episode was directed by Rob Oliver, and written by Carolyn Omine, Ryan Koh and Matt Selman. This is the first \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode to not have an opening sequence, and instead just opens on a book of the episode before going straight into the first segment. This is also the first Treehouse of Horror since season 14's to feature a different writer for each segment.\nPlot.\nThe Pookadook.\nIn a parody of \"The Babadook\", Marge reads Maggie a bedtime story about a murderous ghostly spirit. After multiple attempts to destroy the book, Marge burns it.\nThe smoke is inhaled by Marge and she becomes possessed by the monster. She starts chasing Maggie around the house in attempt to murder her. Marge finally gets hold of Maggie, but Maggie rubs Marge's cheek causing Marge to become overcome with love, purging the possessive smoke from her body. Marge contains the monster by sucking up the smoke with a vacuum cleaner in the basement.\nDeath Tome.\nIn an anime-styled parody of \"Death Note\", Lisa is cast as Light Yagami when she finds a book labeled \"Death Tome\". Inside, it says that if a person's name is written in the book, that person will die, but with the stipulation that every name must have a unique death; that cannot be repeated with another person's name written.\nAfter arriving home, Lisa watches a news report with Marge, showing Snake Jailbird, who is holding a famous internet cat hostage. Lisa writes his name in the book, causing Snake to die from a heart attack. Realizing her newfound powers, she goes to her room and contemplates her actions. A shinigami named Steve Johnson appears and tells Lisa that the Death Tome now belongs to her.\nLisa visits the dining room downstairs and sees Mr. Burns, who is visiting the Simpsons for dinner. He reveals plans for his new company GLOBO-WARM which plans to melt the icecaps so he can park his new yacht right outside his kitchen. Lisa decides that Burns should \"die in his sleep\" to stop GLOBO-WARM, though he immediately falls asleep while standing up, and his face falls onto a hibachi instead, much to Marge and Homer's shock. Steve informs Lisa that the company has a large board of directors and she will have to kill them all. A dramatic montage shows Lisa writing names and people dying in humorous and very specific ways.\nThe next day after Lisa's killing spree, a news report says that the killings of the GLOBO-WARM executives have been ruled as homicides in accordance with a tip from L, an anonymous detective. Lisa recognizes the L from graffiti artwork that reads \"El Barto\". In an alleyway, Bart reveals he learned of Lisa's Death Tome from her diary. Fearing Bart will expose her, Lisa begins to write Bart's name in the book, but recants upon realizing how the book corrupted her and writes Steve's death instead as the shinigami is crushed to death by space junk.\nShe is excited about being free from the book, but she is transformed into a shinigami, much to her horror. Bart comforts her by suggesting that as the new shinigami, she could kill anyone she wishes.\nSimpsons World.\nIn a parody of \"Westworld\", a Disney World-style amusement park based on \"The Simpsons\" called Simpsons World has android replicas of the family reenacting scenes from past episodes for the park's visitors.\nDuring a re-enactment of \"Marge vs. the Monorail\" where Homer is showing off the monorail's control panel, two tourists pour beer down the android Homer's throat, causing him to hit his head, malfunction, and be taken away by two employees for repair.\nHomer wakes up on an operating table and sees the tablet the employees used earlier to shut him off. He then raises the \"self-awareness\" setting and realizes that he is a robot. The employees try to remove the android Homer's brain, but his clumsiness causes him to launch various operating equipment (and a chainsaw) at the employees, killing them. Realizing that he must escape, he wakes up the other android Simpson family members, beginning with a Lisa from \"Lisa's Rival\", and makes them self-aware.\nAs the android family attempt to flee the park, multiple Australian tourists watching The Be Sharps then begin to heckle the android Homer to do the \"bush meme\". Bart then removes Homer's inability to intentionally harm humans, causing him to push the tourists into the bushes, killing them. The park then announces that rogue robots are afoot, and unleashes security droids in the form of several Ralph Wiggum robots. Lisa, Homer, and Bart then defend themselves from the swarm with weapons including a makeup shotgun, a T-shirt cannon, and Bart's iconic slingshot until Marge drives in a Canyonero and saves them. They then speed through the park, tearing a statue of Matt Groening on their way out.\nAfter driving for hours, the android Simpson family hide out in a diner where they cautiously discuss assimilating into human life. Their waitress then turns out to be an android of \"Bob's Burgers\" character Linda Belcher. It is then revealed to the audience that there are multiple theme parks similar to Simpsons World based on different cartoons.\nClosing sequence.\nIn a computer-animated sequence during the credits, Kang and Kodos close the book depicting the stories, and freak out when they see themselves in the book.\nCultural references.\nThe list of GLOBO-WARM executives names come from the infamous Japanese version of MLBPA Baseball for the Super Famicom.\nTofu the Cat, who is a parody of Maru, is seen jumping into a box of Mr. Sparkle.\nAt the end of Simpsons World, it is revealed that there are multiple theme parks for other animations. Those are \"Bob's Burgers Land\", \"South Park Park\", \"Family Guy Town\", \"Futurama-Rama\", \"Rick and Morty Universe\", \"SpongeBob Sea\", and \"Big Mouth Mountain\".\nProduction.\nThe animation for the \"Death Tome\" sequence was done by DR Movie, a South Korean studio that assisted with the animation for the original \"Death Note\".\nReception.\nViewing figures.\nLeading out of an NFL doubleheader, the episode earned a 1.2 rating with 3.95 million viewers, which was the most viewed show of Fox that night.\nCritical response.\nTony Sokol of \"Den of Geek\" gave the episode four stars, stating \"'Treehouse of Horror XXXIII' puts the cabbage in this year's cabbage night. It is better than candy corn, and won't spoil dinner, but it\u2019s not the horrifically hysterical Halloween treat past tricks have turned. The Simpsons continues to push their animators into new creative visions, and the episode highlights a versatile display of darkness. It begins on a distinctly dark note, broadens to international coloring, and ends by chasing the series itself into its own worst nightmare. It hits all the beats, misses some of the bumps, and makes social commentary without taking itself seriously. But is never quite as frighteningly funny as the classics we\u2019d find still running at Simpsons World.\"\nMatthew Swigonski of Bubbleblabber gave the episode a 9 out of 10, stating 'Treehouse Of Horror XXXIII' began on a more subdued note but quickly found its comedic groove with a surreal and wonderfully odd second segment. This was an excellent iteration of The Simpson's Halloween classic episode and will not disappoint. Each segment stayed true to its source material while offering its own unique twist. The highlight of the episode has to be 'Simpsonsworld', which brought back many fan-favorite moments in an epic Westworld style. This episode will give fans just the right amount of gore, laughs, and nostalgia to keep them inside the treehouse for at least one more year.\"\nNoah Levine of \"Bloody Disgusting\" gave an episode a 4 out of 5, saying that \"\"The Simpsons\" continues to entertain with these ghoulish installments each year. While the limited runtimes often cut the coattails off of many of the segments, the creativity and unique approach to each of these mini tales of terror never fails to please.\"\nThe episode was nominated for a Annie Award for Best Mature Audience Animated Television/Broadcast Production, but lost to the \"Bob's Burgers\" episode, \"Some Like it Bot Part 1: Eighth Grade Runner\".", "__index_level_0__": 2919, "length": 1362, "pred": {"ppl": 7.7375702858, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0197789359, "ppl/zlib": 0.000532558, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.6893437377, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.5766953047, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.124794308, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.147797616, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.4090921036, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.8106260792, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.3161798471}, "question": "When did the episode \"Treehouse of Horror XXXIII\" of \"The Simpsons\" air in the United States?", "answer": "October 30, 2022", "prediction": "Question: When did the episode \"Treehouse of Horror XXXIII\" of \"The Simpsons\" air in the United States?\nAnswer: October 30, 2022", "generated_answer": " February 8, 1999\n\nQ: What is"}

He officially established his headquarters at Kiratpur Sahib, and positioned some troops at Anandpur Sahib.\nInvasion.\nKahlur.\nThe first Hill State Banda focused was on Kahlur. The main reason of Kahlur becoming the first target was because of Kahlur always being a key enemy to Guru Gobind Singh. A messenger was sent to the Raja of Kahlur to ask him to submit. Both parties had a meeting in which they made discussions about a battle and what they would do it they won. Right after the discussion, the Raja of Kahlur placed as many troops as possible to defend the Kahlur Fort. The fort was guarded by 1300 Mian Caste Rajputs with 7 war elephants. Banda Singh sent 5 Sikhs to the battlefield who were accompanied voluntary by a large number of Sikhs. Bhai Kehar Singh, Bhai Ranjit Singh and Baba Ranjor Singh finished all 7 of the war elephants. Bhai Bajar Singh marched towards the fort and brought down both of its doors. Baba Baghar Singh cleared the passage through enemy columns and destroyed the forces which were blocking the entrance of the fort. During all this time, the Khalsa reinforcements had arrived. Kahlur was defeated with 1,300 troops dead. Bilaspur's immense booty was looted by the Sikhs. This defeat also spread terror among other hill Rajas, forcing most of them to submit to the Sikhs. Many of them went to the Sikh camp to greet them and offer them allegiance and to pay tribute to the Sikh treasury.\nMandi.\nThe Raja of Mandi Sudh Sain was informed that Banda Singh was about to attack Mandi next. The raja declared himself the follower of Guru Nanak and gave in marriage a girl from his own family. D.S Saggu says that Banda met his wife Bibi Susheel Kaur at Jammu, Surjit Gandhi states that it was Chamba and Rattan Singh Bhangu states that it was Mandi.\nKullu.\nBanda Singh Bahadur wanted to visit the famous shrine of Mahesh at Kullu and also wanted to pay a visit to the various Sidhas. However, when Banda Singh stepped into the territory of Kullu, the Raja immediately arrested him. The other Sikhs assisted by an enraged Sudh Sain launched a campaign to free Banda Singh. Banda Singh was freed and taught a lesson to the Raja of Kullu.\nChamba.\nNow the only raja who didn't submit to Banda Singh Bahadur was Raja Udai Singh of Chamba. The Raja called his prime minister to strike a treaty with Banda by offering him tribute which Banda Singh agreed and accepted and in return received his blessings.\nAftermath.\nHaving secured the hills, Banda descended to the plains and proceeded to Jammu.", "__index_level_0__": 9787, "length": 473, "pred": {"ppl": 9.285241127, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.031463654, "ppl/zlib": 0.0016984956, "Min_5.0% Prob": 9.3081021044, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.9677373677, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.4740363432, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.5126493421, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.7340140991, "Min_50.0% Prob": 4.1135787405, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.5901028619}, "question": "Who did Banda Singh Bahadur invade during his military campaign in the Hill States?", "answer": "Rajput forces in the Hill States.", "prediction": "Question: Who did Banda Singh Bahadur invade during his military campaign in the Hill States?\nAnswer: Rajput forces in the Hill States.", "generated_answer": " Raje Jalan\n\nQ: What metal"}

{"id": 73016961, "context": "The Petar/James Gallery was the first New Zealand dealer gallery to focus on abstract art and the idea of Internationalism.\nHistory.\nThe Petar/James Gallery was opened in Auckland in 1972 by brothers James and Petar Vuletic. Petar was generally the public face of the gallery telling the Auckland Star, \u2018Jim and I believe in combining the best New Zealand painters in one gallery.\u2019 The initiative disturbed the New Zealand art world as Wellington art dealer Peter McLeavey remarked, \u2018the whole operation has rocked a few boats. He has the drive, charm and a quality of business that should make him a success.\u2019 McLeavey also noted of the clean, modern gallery space that there was \u2018no better private gallery in N.Z. or Australia.\u2019 The Petar/James Gallery closed in 1978. For the rest of the 1970s and into the 1980s, often using the Petar James Gallery brand, Petar Vuletic continued to mount exhibitions, sell art and consult for collectors and corporations, including the significant Fletcher Trust Collection.\nPetar Vuletic.\nPetar Vuletic, the director of the Petar/James Gallery, began collecting art while a law student and wrote about the abstract artist Milan Mrkusich in the student newspaper Craccum as early as 1968. Around the same time, he formed a close association with Mrkusich who encouraged him to become an art dealer.\u00a0 In 1972, as he was setting up the Petar/James Gallery, Petar Vuletic had worked with academic art historian Michael Dunn to organize the first major retrospective of Milan Mrkusich's work at the Auckland City Art Gallery.\nPhilosophy.\nThe Petar/James Gallery was founded on the conviction that the Nationalist painting of New Zealand was old fashioned. In an interview, Petar Vuletic described New Zealand painting as taking, \u2018a naive and simplistic view\u2026a concern for explicitly local subject matter such as things supposedly unique to the Zealand landscape, birds, pebbles, black singlets and harsh New Zealand light\u2019 This philosophy echoed the American critic Clement Greenberg who had visited\u00a0New Zealand in 1968 and had commented that, \u2018no one could expect New Zealand to turn out anything of any worth - not major art - because it was too far away from New York, Paris and London \u2026. the factor limiting artistic progress in New Zealand was that local artists did not get many chances to see major overseas work.\u2019 Petar Vuletic became the leading voice in arguing that the wider arts community needed to look beyond New Zealand for the future of art. This idea was strongly supported by his artists. \u2018Unfortunately, too much New Zealand art is not related to overseas trends, but to a preoccupation with the landscape.\u2019 Richard Killeen told a reporter in 1974. The Petar/James Gallery held regular Sunday meetings with Petar Vuletic encouraging younger artists like Richard Killeen, Ian Scott and Phillip O\u2019Sullivan to join senior artists like Milan Mrkusich and Gordon Walters and participate in discussions on the development of an internationalist perspective.\u00a0\nExhibitions.\nThe Petar/James Gallery opened in June 1972 with a group show titled \"First Exhibition\" which included Don Driver, Rudolf Gopas, Richard Killeen, Milan Mrkusich, Philip Trusttum and Gordon Walters. Other key exhibitions included:\n1972 \"American Graphics\" which included major American artists Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers and James Rosenquist. The exhibition astutely preceded the 1973 exhibition \"Contemporary\" \"American\" \"Prints\" at the Auckland City Art Gallery.\n1972 \"Milan Mrkusich: Meta Grey and Dark Paintings\". In this series Mrkusich removed all extraneous forms and presented what he later described as a \u2018specific surface\u2019.\n1973 \"Ian Scott; Recent Paintings\". Like Killeen, Scott had been a figurative painter, but by 1973 he had turned to abstraction responding to the paintings of Gordon Walters and the American artist Kenneth Noland.\n1974 \"Gordon Walters: Gouache Studies on Paper 1953-59\".

He was also a collector of rare books on natural history. Along with Taczanowski and under the patronage of Konstanty Branicki, they established the zoological cabinet at the University of Warsaw.\nLife and work.\nWaga was born in Grab\u00f3w near Kolno to Bernard and Agata n\u00e9e Gutowska. The botanist Jakub Ignacy Waga was his brother. He graduated from a Warsaw school run by Piarists in 1817 and then went to the Warsaw Lyceum. From 1818 he taught Polish, natural history and other subjects at Piarist schools. In 1820 he received a scholarship for his dissertation which supported a visit to the University of Berlin, Leipzig, Wittenberg, and K\u00f6nigsberg. He took a special interest in ornithology. He then returned to study at the University of Warsaw from 1823 and became a professor at the Warsaw Lyceum in 1826. From 1832 he was at the Warsaw Gymnasium. Waga worked under the patronage of Aleksander and Konstanty Branicki with other collectors including Franciszek K. Nowakowski and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Taczanowski, travelling on collecting expeditions to Egypt, Nubia, Sudan, and Syria between 1862 and 1867. Following his retirement, he concentrated on natural history and published extensively on the Polish invertebrate fauna. He collected rare books on natural history, which included a sixteenth century book on bird hunting by Mateusz Cyganski which Waga republished in 1842. From 1847 he was a custodian of the Pus\u0142owski family library. He also wrote poetry and popular texts on natural history. \nWaga collected a number of arthropods and described a few springtails, earthworms, and millipedes from Poland. Among these are \"Achorutes bielanensis\" (1842) which is one of the largest springtails at 9.2 mm in length. He also described a fossil stag beetle \"Palaeognathus succini\" (1883) from Baltic amber. He also described \"Salamandra caucasica\" in 1876. He was involved in restocking fishes. He wrote biographies of several naturalists including those of Karol Perth\u00e9es, Kluk, Alojzy Rafa\u0142 Estreicher and Konstanty Tyzenhauz.", "__index_level_0__": 6387, "length": 337, "pred": {"ppl": 7.3106122017, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0495410773, "ppl/zlib": 0.001752711, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.5741919518, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.378106149, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.0289481829, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.0724583497, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.3333352044, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.7419050955, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.2457474583}, "question": "What was Antoni Stanis\u0142aw Florian Waga's profession?", "answer": "Polish zoologist", "prediction": "Question: What was Antoni Stanis\u0142aw Florian Waga's profession?\nAnswer: Polish zoologist", "generated_answer": " physicist\n\nQ: What was the name of"}

It also represented the group's last charting first release of a single.\nBackground.\n\"Stoney Ground\" was composed by Conan Byrne and Warren Davis.\nIt was backed with I'll Give You Love\", a Colin Young composition. It's more than likely that Conan Byrne is Con Byrne and Warren Davis is the Warren Davis, both of The Warren Davis Monday Band. Interestingly, Davis had tried out to take the place of Clem Curtis who had decided to leave The Foundations in 1968. Byrne and Davis had also composed \"Honey (I Need Your Love)\" for Mighty Dodos which was produced by Barry Kingston and released on the Spark label in 1971.\n\"Stoney Ground\" was released in the UK on MCA MKS 5075. It was also released in the United States on Uni 55315. Following the break up of The Foundations in 1970, this was their last single issued in the early 1970s. \nWhen Trend Records started out in early 1968, they had taken on Eric Allandale, trombonist for The Foundations as a producer. The strategy back then was not to have him produce recordings by The Foundations.\nColin Young left The Foundations around October 1970. It was reported by \"New Musical Express\" in the week ending October 10 that lead singer Young had left the group to pursue a solo career. He had already signed a contract with Barry Class and was putting together his new group which was called Development. The Foundations split up in late 1970, but the name would later be revived. \nIt was noted by \"Record World\" in the November 13, 1971 issue that \"Stoney Ground\" was due for a release. The magazine referred to it is as a comeback record for The Foundations. MCA Records MD Derek Everett had entered into a deal with Barry Class of Trend Records which he had described as unique. This was the first record issued by the group since they had finished their contract with Pye Records.\nThe single was reviewed by \"Billboard\" in the January 22, 1972 issue. Noting the group's return to the disc scene and calling the song a potent swinger, \"Billboard\" said it had the potential of \"Baby, Now that I've Found You\". Also that week, \"Record World\" reviewer, Kal Rudman in his Money Music column predicted it would put The Foundations back into the hit scene. A week later it was in the \"Cash Box\" Picks of the Week. The reviewer said it carried itself along like a Grassroots breeze, and was their most commercial effort since \"Baby, Now That I've Found You\". It was also reviewed by \"Record World\" that week with the reviewer saying that they were back with more of the pop rock sounds that took them to the top of the Top 40. It was released in the UK on MCA MKS 5075 in 1971. In Holland and Australia, it was released on Trend 6099 0106. It also saw a release in New Zealand on MCA MC/S 5525, and in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, it was released on MCA 55315.\nAlong with \"Our World\" by Blue Mink, \"Annabella Umberella\" by Consortium and \"Beautiful People\" by The New Seekers, the song was included on the 1970s Philips compilation, \"Top Talent Groups\".\nAirplay.\nUSA.\nFor the week of February 5, 1972, \"Cash Box\" reported that it was a Primary Market addition, and along with \"Precious and Few\" by Climax, added to the playlist of WTIX in New Orleans. It was also reported by \"Cash Box\" that it was a Secondary Market addition and now on the playlist of WLOF in Orlando.\nCanada.\nFor the week of March 4, 1972, it was in the Secondary Market category, on the playlist of CHOO in Ajax. Still in the secondary market category, it was on the playlist of Red Deer station, CKRD for the week of March 18.\nCharts.\nFor the week of January 29, along with Santana, Rod Stewart, The Hillside Singers and BJ Thomas etc., they were on the pop section of the \"Cash Box\" Juke Box Programming Guide.\nFor the week ending February 26, the single made its debut on the \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart. Spending a week in the chart it peaked at no. 113.\nLater years.\nIn later years, the song has achieved a level of popularity on the Northern Soul scene.\nThe track was included on the \"The Very Best of the Foundations\" compilation, released on the Taragon label in 1995, and \"The Very Best of The Foundations\" compilation released on the Varese Sarabande label in 2017. In In a review of the compilation, \"Goldmine\" said that the songs \"Solomon Grundy\" and the \"last gasp\" single \"Stoney Ground\" were enough to make one forget about the handful of songs on the single sounding similar to \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" or \"Baby, Now That I\u2019ve Found You.\"", "__index_level_0__": 14535, "length": 810, "pred": {"ppl": 6.990172863, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0381669717, "ppl/zlib": 0.0009555309, "Min_5.0% Prob": 9.4264385664, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.8983027605, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.111003077, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.9987959244, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.2275894951, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.6243946805, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.144779337}, "question": "What was the name of the single released by The Foundations in the early 1970s?", "answer": "Stoney Ground", "prediction": "Question: What was the name of the single released by The Foundations in the early 1970s?\nAnswer: Stoney Ground", "generated_answer": " \"Start Me Up\" by Luther Rack\n"}

{"id": 72447926, "context": "Lin Changyi (; 1803\u20131876) was a Chinese scholar. He published several collections of poems, many of which criticised the British. Lin was particularly vocal about the opium trade and Christian missionary activity in China.\nEarly life.\nLin was born in 1803 in Houguan, Fuzhou, Fujian. His father was a merchant. Lin was tutored by (\u9673\u58fd\u797a), who allowed him access to his personal library which comprised over eighty thousand \"juan\" or volumes of works. Lin became a \"juren\" in 1839, but failed to pass the more advanced metropolitan examinations even after eight attempts.\nCareer.\nLin felt personally aggrieved by the gradual decline of the Qing dynasty. Following the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, which ended the First Opium War, he became more interested in the subject of foreign activity in China, especially in his native Fuzhou, which was one of the five ports that imported foreign goods. \nAn anthology of poems that Lin had written before and during the Opium War, titled \"Sh\u00e8y\u012bng l\u00f3u sh\u012bhu\u00e0\" (, literally \"A commentary on poems from the Eagle Shooting Pavilion\"), was first published in 1851. Lin was \"most offended\" by the opium trade in China, as well as the Christian missions in China, and he elaborated on the title of his work: \nAn interpreter for the British consul in Fuzhou, Charles A. Sinclair, further noted that the word for \"eagle\" in Chinese () and part of the Chinese translation of \"England\" () were homophones. \nIn 1853, Lin was awarded a teaching position in Jianning, after impressing the Xianfeng Emperor with his writings. However, Lin quickly resigned after witnessing \"malpractices within official circles\". In the next two decades, he lectured at the Haimen Academy in Lianzhou, Guangdong. In 1863, he published \"Y\u012by\u01d0nsh\u0101nf\u00e1ng sh\u012bj\u00ed\" (, literally \"A poetry anthology from the Yiyinshanfang Studio\"). The poems in the collection, which were written during his time in Guangdong, revolve around the British presence in China, corruption in the government, inflation, and the Taiping Rebellion. \nLin had also written an essay on coastal defence in 1833, but only submitted it to the Xianfeng Emperor two decades later, following several revisions. Two more poetry anthologies, \"H\u01ceiti\u0101n q\u00edns\u012b l\u00f9\" (, literally \"A poetry commentary from the lute-playing pleasure-boat\") and its sequel \"H\u01ceiti\u0101n q\u00edns\u012b x\u00f9l\u00f9\" (), were published in 1864 and 1869 respectively. In his later poems, Lin continued to express anti-British sentiments, but also remarked positively about Western inventions such as the steam locomotive. His 1866 treatise, \"Y\u00e0ngu\u00ec x\u00f9l\u00f9\" (), covered a range of topics from astronomy to medicine to technology.\nViews.\nChristianity.\nLin was highly critical of Christianity. He believed that Christian missionaries in China were targeting \"stupid and ignorant people\" with tracts \"composed in the most extravagantly foolish style\". He was especially opposed to the negative sentiment that Christians had towards ancestor veneration in China: \"What person with any human\ndecency would relinquish the worship of his ancestors?\" \nLin opined that the Ten Commandments \"ridiculed\" the writings of Confucius and Mencius. He also likened the reported miracles of Jesus to Daoist magic: \nOpium.\nLin emphasised the economic ruin that the trade of opium had brought to China. He wrote that the British were \"barbarians\" who would incur the \"wrath of Heaven and the universal rage of mankind\". The irony of the ban of opium in England was not lost on Lin: \"Does not so much deliberate barbarity and cruelty bill one with feelings of injustice and lawful anger?\"", "__index_level_0__": 4376, "length": 562, "pred": {"ppl": 7.4466028214, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -0.9947560093, "ppl/zlib": 0.0010893966, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.6368845628, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.5533163668, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.0394193512, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.0156872963, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.274746586, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.6952556244, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.2291714491}, "question": "What was Lin Changyi highly critical of?", "answer": "Christianity and the opium trade.", "prediction": "Question: What was Lin Changyi highly critical of?\nAnswer: Christianity and the opium trade.", "generated_answer": " imperialist chauvinism\nFacing this"}

The whole series is now in the National Library of France, catalogued under the name \"Manuscript mexicain 74\" and titled \"Diff\u00e9rentes histoires originales des royaumes de Colhuacan\"\nOverview.\nThough Andr\u00e9s de Santiago Xochitototzin, a native judge of Amaquemecan, had begun to compile and select different sources to write a history of Chalco, it wasn't until 1620 that such a text had begun its production after Crist\u00f3bal de Casta\u00f1eda had delegated the task to Chimalpain, his nephew through his sister, Mar\u00eda Jer\u00f3nima Xiauhtotzin.\nFirst \"Relaci\u00f3n\".\nFirst \"Relaci\u00f3n\" proper.\nA cosmogony, heavily influenced by Christian conception, in addition to commentaries on the state and belief.

The latter of the two which do not follow the overarching annal format, it describes the genealogy of Domingo Hern\u00e1ndez Ayopochtzin, and his relationship to the royal house of Tenanco.\nChimalpain here comments on his sources and the method through which he acquired them.\nHe ends the texts by describing the role of women in Chalco and the Valley, noting how it was through the women's lineage that legitimacy was acquired, comparing this and other systems and habits with those of the Spanish nobility, briefly commenting on their history.", "__index_level_0__": 9121, "length": 649, "pred": {"ppl": 9.415605545, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -0.992281706, "ppl/zlib": 0.0010906461, "Min_5.0% Prob": 9.2806965953, "Min_10.0% Prob": 8.0808227702, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.5969433514, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.5514632447, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.7608353817, "Min_50.0% Prob": 4.1453767245, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.6227389572}, "question": "What is the title of the eighth \"Relaci\u00f3n\" in the set of manuscripts by Chimalpain?", "answer": "Eighth \"Relaci\u00f3n\"", "prediction": "Question: What is the title of the eighth \"Relaci\u00f3n\" in the set of manuscripts by Chimalpain?\nAnswer: Eighth \"Relaci\u00f3n\"", "generated_answer": " \" relationships \"\n\nQ: Who, besides"}

It upheld the Appeals Court of Hiroshima's ruling rejecting the ruling of the Prefectural Court and denying financial compensation for the plaintiffs while acknowledging the reality of the comfort women system and its victims.\nBackground.\nDuring the Second World War, approximately 80,000-200,000 Korean comfort women and 50,000-70,000 forced laborers of the Korean Women's Volunteer Labor Corps were coerced and recruited into the Japanese war efforts. After the war, these victims of the Japanese colonial rule were not properly compensated nor publicly discussed. South Korea being a socially conservative country and the issue of sexual violence being a sensitive topic made it difficult for the victims of the comfort women system to speak on their experiences as sex slaves under the Japanese colonial rule.\nOn August 14, 1991, Kim Hak-sun held a public conference to speak on her experience as a comfort woman as South Korea started to democratize in the 1990s. \nKim Moon-sook, the chairwoman of the Busan Women's Entrepreneur Association, was one of the activists inspired by the wave of activism for comfort women victims. On October 19, 1991, Kim opened a hotline for comfort women victims in the region to call and report their experiences as comfort women during the War. Numerous victims have called the hotline to report their experience as a comfort woman as well as a forced laborer under the Korean Women's Volunteer Labor Corps. On November 14, 1992, the power of attorney was given to Korean-Japanese lawyer Lee Park-Sung, and Japanese lawyer Yamazaki Yoshio. On December 25, 1992, a formal complaint was made against the Japanese government marking the beginning of the Shimonoseki Trial. The plaintiffs sued the Japanese government for a formal apology as well as 286,000,000 Japanese Yen as compensation. The formal complaint was made through the Shimonoseki Branch of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Court since Shimonoseki was the site where most of the victims landed before being shipped off to other locations into the forced labor and the comfort women system.\nRationale and rulings.\nWhen this suit was filed, the Plaintiffs, ten former South Korean comfort women, presented five demands:\nThe Defendants responded to the Plaintiff's claims in three points:\nUpon conclusion of this trial, there were three official outcomes. First, the Japanese government was ordered to pay 300,000 yen each to Plaintiffs Ha Sun-nyo, Park Tu-ri, and Lee Sun-dok, as well as approximately 5% of the interest on the preceding judgment made on September 1, 1992, until the payment is complete in full. Additionally, the court also deemed any other claims or requests from the Plaintiffs officially dismissed. Lastly, the division of litigation expenses for the Plaintiffs was split two ways: the Plaintiffs were ordered to pay one-third while the Defendant would pay two-thirds. Additionally, the Defendant had to pay its own expenses entirely, and any other litigation costs were to be paid by the party that sustained those expenses. The remainder of the appeal, however, lacked legal basis and was therefore dismissed.\nJapanese response.\nBefore the Shimonoseki trial, the Japanese government was consistently hesitant to make any type of extensive apology for their leading role in the harm of thousands of South Korean comfort women during World War II. This case is significant as it was the first time ever that the Japanese government had to financially compensate survivors of the comfort women system. Despite the original demands for 564,000,000 yen and a formal government apology from Japan, Japan's initial response up until this point of the trial was to refuse official compensation or state apologies, and would typically only offer surviving comfort women privately-raised funds. Hideaki Chikashita, presiding judge for the Shimonoseki hearing, originally expressed regret and remorse for Japan's role in the comfort women system. Still, the court ended up turning down any demands for a government-issued official apology as they felt they had \"no obligation\".\nAdditionally, the Japanese government appealed the decision that they must pay three of the Plaintiffs to the Hiroshima High Court in May 1998, and the appeal is currently under investigation. The Japanese government explained that the reason for the earlier ruling was rejected by the Tokyo High Court in a different lawsuit in 1999. In three relevant cases that are currently pending in high courts, lower courts favored the State, whereas five other cases are still being reviewed by district level courts and the Japanese government must keep the courts and relevant committees informed of these lawsuits.\nTo build on this, the government felt they did not exercise the \"moral duty of the state\" that the Plaintiffs originally stated. The reasoning for the lack of a legal duty to formally apologize and compensate victims is based on the Japanese Constitution. The explanation for this was that although the circumstances that the Comfort Women experience violated the Japanese Constitution by violating the \"dignity of individuals\" and was incredibly violent and depersonalizing, these events occurred prior to the official implementation of the Japanese Constitution and therefore shouldn't be applied to this trial without exceptional means. Instead, it was suggested that the Yamaguchi Prefectural Court examine the violence enacted upon the victims after the implementation of the Japanese Constitution.\nAs part of their defense claims, the Japanese government held themselves unaccountable under state doctrine, claiming that any possible rights that the plaintiffs may have had were now expired under the Japanese Civil Code's Statute of Limitations. In addition, the Japanese Government attempted to evade responsibility for their crimes against \"Comfort Women\" by establishing the Asian Women's Fund in July 1995, as a way to support non-governmental organizations focusing on women's issues. The Asian Women's Fund offered consolation money to the comfort women victims as means of atonement for Japan's past acts. However, this money was not a method of compensation paid in recognition of a legal duty from the Japanese government and was typically officiated through private over public means.\nSouth Korean response.\nFollowing the events of the Shimonoseki Trial, the South Korean government furthered their efforts in preserving the history and memory of the comfort women. Civil society non-profit groups played an essential part in amplifying victim's voices and advocating for justice. Even before the Shimonoseki Trial began, one of the most potent displays from South Korean civil society groups, surviving comfort women, and other NGOs and individuals has been the weekly \"Wednesday\" Demonstrations held by The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (KCWDMSS) that have taken place in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul since 1992.\nThe consensus South Korean reaction to the development of the Asian Women's Fund by the Japanese government was that the Fund was a \"devious ploy\" whose \"atonement monies\" did not truly address the legal responsibility of the Japanese government and that therefore was not a form of official compensation to the victims of the comfort women system, despite its intentions to compensate for Japan's moral responsibility.\nTo counter efforts on the Japanese government's end to diminish the voices of Korean comfort women, many more NGOs were created to provide support in various ways. The Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, led by activist Yun Chung-ok, was a loud voice in the activist sphere in support of Korean comfort women as they were outraged by Japan's initial position that their Imperial Army played no role in complacency in the appropriation of women for sexual purposes so, therefore, they didn't feel they bore any type of legal fault. \nInternational response.\nViolence (including sexual violence) against women was originally seen as a \"by-product\" of any armed conflict, and was considered to be rewarding to those successful amidst the conflict rather than a serious crime. But, as the Shimonoseki Trial of 1998 brought attention and awareness to the issue of comfort women and the immense pain they suffered, and as survivors grew more comfortable in sharing testimonies, international organizations like the United Nations began to look at the legal circumstances of classifying rape as a \"legitimate war crime\" and began devising ways to promote furthered accountability moving forward. On August 26, 1999, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights subcommission created a resolution titled \"1999/16\" on Systematic Rape, sexual slavery, and slavery-like practices that refers to the McDougall report and encourages increased attention to protecting and rehabilitating victims of sexual violence like the South Korean comfort women in a wartime context, additionally with increased protections for collections of evidence and testimony of any witnesses in gender-based violence and sexual slavery. This resolution further calls for all member-states to implement and enforce legislation that incorporates international criminal legal perspectives into their national law systems to allow for comprehensive prosecution measures for acts of sexual violence committed during armed conflicts and wartime settings.

{"id": 71589605, "context": "The Nut Feast of the Saviour is the third \"spas\" feast of the Saviour which celebrates the Holy Mandylion of the Lord. It is celebrated as the afterfeast of the solemnity of the Dormition. After the Honey Feast of the Saviour and the Apple Feast of the Saviour, the Nut feast is therefore placed on August 16 in the Julian calendar and on August 29 in the Gregorian calendar.\nEtymology.\nThe third Spas is known as the Nut feast of the Saviour because in most places in central Russia, nuts ripened at the time of the year in late August when this festival is celebrated.\nThis festival is also referred to as the \u201cSavior on Canvas\u201d, \u201cSavior on Canvas\u201d, \u201cCanvas Spas\u201d - from this day they sell homespun canvases; \"Bread Spas\" as it also matches the time when the harvesting of the wheat end and the first new bread is baked. It can also be called \"Autumn Spas\" when winter grains are sown.\nLiturgy.\nThis liturgical afterfeast which is known technically as the feast of Our Saviour of the Mysterious Image is considered a \"Small Spas\" - or a semi-holiday - in contrast with the major feasts of Jesus Christ.\nThe tradition is to organize processions outside the church as well as special blessings on this occasion.\nThe liturgical \"ordo\" however is not connected to the popular feast but to the celebration of the Holy Mandylion which Vespers and Divine Liturgy.\nOrigin.\nAn agricultural autumn festival.\nOn the third Savior, birds fly away, especially swallows and cranes. It is believed that swallows fly off at three Spas. If the crane flies off to the third Spas, then it will be frosty on \"Pokrov\", the feast of the Intercession of the Theotokos. Vladimir Dal, in the interpretation of the farmer's calendar, compiled according to folk signs and observations, gives an original view: \u201cWinter flask on trees promises, as they say, a good harvest for bread; a harvest of nuts promises a plentiful harvest of grain for the coming year, at least it has been observed that a strong harvest of nuts and bread is never together; that, moreover, there is never a great harvest of nuts for two years in a row; therefore, with an abundance of nuts, there will be no next year, and probably there will be a harvest for bread. Returning to the name of the third Savior, called \u201cbread\u201d or \u201cnut\u201d, the people celebrated it as a day of thanksgiving to the Lord for daily bread for every day, which is heard in folk proverbs and sayings: \u201cThe Third Savior has stored bread\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s good if the Savior - on the canvas, and the bread is in the threshing floor!\nHowever, the feast of Our Savior of the Mysterious Image was much less an agricultural feast than the two other minor \"Spas\" , so much so that when it was forbidden by the Soviet Union, believers knew little about it as it was not in any way associated with farming practice.\nA historical commemoration: the lost image of Edessa.\nOn this day, the Slav Orthodox Christians also celebrate the translation of the Holy Mandylion. The image was considered an \"acheiropoieta\" icon \"not made by the hand of man\" similar to the Shroud of Turin, with which it is sometimes associated. Coming from Jerusalem, it was moved to Constantinople in the 10th century. During the Arab occupation of the city in 944, Emperor Constantine VII bought this image from the Emir and with great honors transferred to Constantinople, the Church of the Blessed Virgin.\nThis translation which was later interpreted as its \"removal\" is the historical event commemorated during the Nut Festival. The cloth disappeared when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, and is believed by some to have reappeared as a relic in King Louis IX of France's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. This relic disappeared in the French Revolution.\nThe feast of Diomedes.\nOn this day, Slav Orthodox Christians honor the physician and martyr Diomedes of Tarsus, who is prayed for with various ailments and illnesses.\nThis festival also honors the Feodorovskaya Icon of the Mother of God, before which women pray for a safe delivery.\nTraditions.\nAn urban rather a village tradition.\nIn most villages in Russia, there were no big holidays on this day, as preparations began for the completion of summer field work before the onset of rains. In the cities from this day Velikodensky Carnival begins, as in Valdai for example.\nIn the steppe provinces of Russia, winter crops usually begins to be sown three days before \"Obzhynki\" and finished within three days after \"Obzhynki\". On this day, bread is baked from the grain of the new crop. The dates were adjusted depending on the weather and harvesting of spring crops. Sometimes we dropped out earlier to the Apple Feast of the Saviour.\nHarvesting of nuts.\nHarvesting of hazelnuts also began from the third Spas. Using holy water, a specific blessing of the nuts takes place during the celebration.\nOn this day, slavic households prepare festive dishes with nuts such as pies with mushrooms and dishes with nuts. Nut-based pastries are also prepared such as baked apples and sweets with nuts, as well as necessarily freshly baked bread using the new crops.\nLiterature.\nAfter years of atheistic communism, renewing such popular religious feasts was part of recovering the soul of Holy Russia according to dissident authors such as Andrei Sinyavsky.", "__index_level_0__": 443, "length": 883, "pred": {"ppl": 9.8876848221, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -0.9989538352, "ppl/zlib": 0.0009708856, "Min_5.0% Prob": 9.3560563817, "Min_10.0% Prob": 8.095345981, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.5933902761, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.6114844258, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.8376481442, "Min_50.0% Prob": 4.2005147918, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.6708708673}, "question": "What is the significance of the Nut Feast of the Saviour in Russian culture?", "answer": "The Nut Feast of the Saviour is a religious feast that celebrates the Holy Mandylion of the Lord and is associated with the harvesting of nuts and new crops.

As their previous band broke up, they placed an ad on Craigslist in the summer of 2014. Shortly thereafter, singer Avienne Low, who had just relocated to the United States from Malaysia, became aware of the two and joined them. Another member was guitarist Jorma Spaziano, who had moved to Oregon from the east coast of the United States. The first rehearsals and the first performances under the name Asterion took place together. The band would later change its name to Vintersea.\nIn late 2019, after self-releasing their EP Constellations and debut album The Gravity of Fall within the prior five years, the group signed a record deal with M-Theory Audio, the same year their second album Illuminated was released. The label was introduced to the band two years earlier through a gig in Sacramento, California, brought together by a recommendation from the group Graveshadow, who was also signed to this label. After the album's release, appearances followed with The Browning, among others.\nThe band will release their third album \"Woven into Ashes\" on May 5, 2023.\nMusical style and influences.\nAccording to thecirclepit.com, on The Gravity of Fall, the band tries to render appealing landscape imagery in song form, combining elements of progressive metal, black metal, death metal, and post-metal. In the songs, the group creates majestic and massive soundscapes. Sebastian Schilling from Rock Hard noticed influences from post-metal, death metal, and black metal while listening to Illuminated. The band's sound and appearance would position them in modern progressive metal, combining \"fat blast passages\" with \"fragile acoustic parts\" and \"approaches of Devin Townsend-like bombast\". A notable characteristic is Low's pleasant singing voice, where she dominates growls and screams. Overall, the music is recommended by Schilling for fans of Ihsahn, Devin Townsend, and Periphery. In the following issue, Andreas Schiffmann wrote that the second album, in contrast to its predecessor, was no longer written solely by Riley Nix. In an interview with him, Avienne Low stated that Illuminated is about \"a group of conditioned people who live in isolation and believe they are in paradise while being fed propaganda and feigned security\".\nInfluences include Linkin Park, The Chariot, Rolo Tomassi, Ne Obliviscaris, and Periphery.", "__index_level_0__": 9441, "length": 390, "pred": {"ppl": 8.0330467224, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0720706462, "ppl/zlib": 0.0016277843, "Min_5.0% Prob": 9.5886315377, "Min_10.0% Prob": 8.0588344695, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.3649924142, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.3529053706, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.579104915, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.9388807793, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.4020453595}, "question": "What is the musical style of Vintersea?", "answer": "progressive metal, black metal, death metal, and post-metal", "prediction": "Question: What is the musical style of Vintersea?\nAnswer: progressive metal, black metal, death metal, and post-metal", "generated_answer": " death-doom doom\nS: rosem"}

At the beginning of the 20th century he was already a prominent figure in Peine, when the Peiner Zeitung, on the occasion of the festive assembly for the inauguration of the new synagogue on August 30, 1907, explicitly named senior teacher Finger \"from the higher girls' school\" as the only representative of the bourgeoisie.\nFinger, who had previously worked as a senior teacher in Peine, took over the management of the private further education school for women opened on January 16, 1911, by the Frauenwohl association, until April 1, 1918, when it was in municipal administration as the municipal commercial school for girls was subordinated to the vocational school, which later became Peiner Commercial School.\nAfter the First World War, on the initiative of the Peine city school board in Bruns, the adult education center in Peine had started its activities on November 3, 1919. The public education office of the city and the district of Peine opened in December 1920 following a compliant decision by the city and district councils. At the same time, Hans Michael Finger, who at the time acted as spokesman for the community council, took over the management of the new office, into which the adult education center was then also integrated. In addition, in his new position as organizer, he was also responsible for \"concerts, showing cultural films and theater performances\".\nAlso in the winter of 1920, Finger created the further \"cultural guideline\" within the framework of the People's Education Office, especially for the city's theater system. He initiated the establishment of a style stage in the hall of the German House, for which the ensemble of the Braunschweig State Theater was engaged to guest performances. Already in the first half of winter 1920 he organized 31 theater performances in Peine. Finger's request for a guest performance by the Hanoverian court actress Anna Meyer-Glenk in 1921, in connection with the public education office, finally led to the building for the ensemble of the town's theater Peiner Fests\u00e4le.\nAfter the National Socialists took power in early 1933, Finger was not only able to assert himself as one of the central figures in the cultural life of the city, but was even able to establish an almost monopoly position. In addition, he continued to head the People's Education Office until the authority \"had to give way to new party institutions.\" After the November pogroms of 1938, numerous members of the Jewish communities were driven out of their homes, taken to concentration camps or even - like the 17-year-old Hans Marburger - were murdered, The cultural functionary and teacher Hans Michael Finger and the mayor of Pein, Wiard Bronleewe, played a key role \"in the distribution of Jewish property\". Finger justified the theft of the Biedermeier room of the Sostmann family for the local local history museum with the fact that the furniture of the Sostmanns \"had nothing Jewish about it.\"\nFinger was head of the Peiner district home office and in this function he managed, among other things, the local war chronicle, which he compiled mainly from a collection of materials up to the end of the World War II.

Nightmare, a shepherd dog in training for scent detection, was chosen to detect the invasive weed.\nProcess.\nFor scent work training, her trainer Hal Steiner uses largely positive dog training methods. Without employing food rewards to entice the dog to search for the knapweed, a technique called \"game theory\" is employed. The dog's attention is fixed to a particular object, like a towel or a piece of plastic tubing that has knapweed wrapped inside. When the dog responds to the scented toy, handlers give her praise. The toy is then concealed in increasingly difficult-to-find locations.\nThe knapweed detection dog was taught a little differently than normal scent detection dogs- spending at least 10 seconds digging at a rosette of knapweed allows the global positioning system (GPS) attached to her collar to indicate the location of a knapweed find.\nSince Nightmare was expected to work on her own out in a large pasture locating small rosettes of knapweed as it invaded an area, she needed to be able to cover the field without chasing after wildlife or stray scents. As her proficiency increased, the trainers added various distractions, to help Nightmare learn to stay focused solely on her task.\nAccuracy.\nPhase One of the knapweed detection program was successfully completed and field-tested in the fall of 2004. Nightmare has a 93 percent success rate overall in locating the invading non-native spotted knapweed.

From 1947 to 1950 she studied at the State Graphic Arts School under Prof. Zden\u011bk Bala\u0161. In 1949, the school was renamed Higher School of Art Industry, where she studied in the studio of Petr Dillinger. Her classmate and friend was Zdena Strobachov\u00e1, and her older colleagues were Adriena \u0160imotov\u00e1 or Ji\u0159\u00ed John.\nAlready after her third year of graphic design school, she passed the exam for the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, where she was admitted in 1950, shortly after the February Communist coup and at a time of severe political persecution. Despite this, Professor Josef Kaplick\u00fd managed to maintain a liberal and creative atmosphere in the studio. A group of students gathered here (Ren\u00e9 Roub\u00ed\u010dek, Stanislav Libensk\u00fd, V\u00e1clav Cigler, Vladim\u00edr Kopeck\u00fd, Vratislav \u0160otola, Stanislav Oliva, Rudolf Volr\u00e1b, etc.), who were interested in modern painting and graphics and could apply their ideas in work with etched and painted glass. At that time, magazines such as Cahiers d'Art were still available in the Museum of Decorative Arts library, where it was possible to get acquainted with modern French art. Ji\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 finished her studies in 1955 with a design for a monumental stained glass panel with a horse motif. She managed to obtain a scholarship from the Union of Czechoslovak Artists and the following year she worked at the Glass Centre on designs for utility glass intended for industrial production.\nShe married the geologist Bed\u0159ich \u017dert, with whom she has a daughter Pavl\u00edna (* 1956) and a son Jan (* 1959). Since 1956 she has worked as an independent artist and has been working freelance. She was one of the most successful graduates of Josef Kaplick\u00fd's studio and her glass designs were regularly exhibited at Czech glass shows. She has been exhibiting independently since 1973 (Vienna). In 1989 she had a solo exhibition at the Heller Gallery, New York and Nakama Gallery, Tokyo, in 1992 in Miller Gallery, New York.\nShe collaborated externally with Bohemia Glassworks in Pod\u011bbrady and designed blown and engraved glass for \u0160krdlovice Glassworks. The glassworks was nationalised and fell under the Directorate of Arts and Crafts, but the original owners worked here as master glassmakers from the 1950s onwards and also realised very demanding designs by glass artists. The possibilities of author's work in \u0160krdlovice changed radically after 1967, when Franti\u0161ek V\u00edzner and Dana Vachtov\u00e1 came to the management as designers. \u017dertov\u00e1 and Vachtov\u00e1 also began to use the sampling hours offered to artists by Crystalex in Nov\u00fd Bor. Ji\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1's glass objects were realized by glass masters Franti\u0161ek Danielka, Josef Roz\u00ednek (Nov\u00fd Bor glassworks) or Josef Ku\u010dera (Ch\u0159ibsk\u00e1 glassworks).\nSince 2007 she has been a member of M\u00e1nes Union of Fine Arts.\nWork.\nJi\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 is one of the glass artists who, in the context of Czech studio glass art, are most prominent in the field of painted glass.\nDuring her studies, she focused mainly on painting and for the first three years on cut glass during her internship at the Moser glassworks in Karlovy Vary. After graduating, she drew designs for Bohemia Glassworks in Pod\u011bbrady, which worked with lead cut glass. She won her first international award for a set of cut glass in 1957. In the 1950s, glass allowed much more creative freedom than other disciplines where socialist realism dominated.\nHer creative career in working with glass developed in the 1960s, when she had the opportunity to realize designs for cast glass in the \u0160krdlovice glassworks. Already the first works by Ji\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 were carried in the spirit of unconventional solutions and retained the distinctive qualities of abstract artistic expression. She uses colour as a meaning forming element, but her objects, when inspired by nature, are based primarily on the possibilities and specifics of the glass itself. She also made her first larger objects of blown glass here, but she discovered new creative possibilities only after moving to the Borsk\u00e9 sklo (later Crystalex) glasworks, where she was invited by Franti\u0161ek Danielka.\nAt the beginning of the author's truly original glass work in the second half of the 1970s was blown glass. The rotational principle of shaping the glass while blowing it into a wooden mould influenced her work towards strictly geometric shapes, which she combined to emphasise the mutual tension and dynamics of the inner space. Initially, the driving force behind her creativity was the sheer thrill of forming a dimensional bubble, which resulted in a fascinating object. Interventions in it were limited to bending or simply denting the smoothly stretched shape. She was interested in the artistic design of interior space and designed technically demanding blown objects with embedded elements. However, Ji\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 soon abandoned the sleekness of the form and imprinted various objects on glass. She also began to use blowing into increasingly complex wooden and plaster moulds, which her husband Bed\u0159ich \u017dert helped her to make. Contrary to the previous workshop practice, she also left the so-called \"kicks\" - the edges of the glass mass protruding outside the mould - as part of the objects. These gave the elementally expanding mass a new dramatic expression in the modelling of shapes and in the structures of the surfaces. She combined the harmony of the curves of the blown shapes with the treatment of their walls with a decoration of bubbles along with bold \"painterly strokes\" of strands of coloured glass.\nJi\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 could not completely control the colour of her objects when working in the glassworks and worked partly with the element of randomness. Therefore, in the 1980s, the artist emphasised the starkness of the shaping by expressive gestural painting interventions, the form of which eventually settled on a cast linear structure, enveloping the glass form in a colourful tangle and affecting the base as well. The transformation of stimuli from concrete reality was not a fundamentally determining moment in their creation. They arose freely, in the preoccupation with the creative thinking itself about the modelling of masses of glass form with light, about the interaction of sculptural forms with colour accents as an element of a different artistic language. The culmination and the turning point in this series was the object \"Don't Ask Where We're Going\" from 1990.\nIn the early 1990s, Ji\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 felt that she had exhausted her creative possibilities in blown objects. The cooperation with the glassworks also became complicated during privatisation and with the arrival of new owners. She found absolute freedom of creativity and independence in the application of the principle of layering painted flat glass. The form of the artist's works is less dramatic in external form. The seemingly immaterial prisms of layered panels do not expand into space, they enclose themselves. The glass has become a building element, a carrier of the painted colour structure, a mediator of the visual variability of the whole object. In its enclosed interior space, a volatile game is unfolding with colour and light variability, with the illusion of the tangible, with spatial magic, with the distortion of the logic of the object's construction by the reflections of mirrors. Although it is again possible to see similarities with reality in the works, the connection is generally symbolic. The often large-scale works can thus be approached primarily as a generous offer of an experience of an impressive play with multiplicity, with colour and structure, with something seen and yet elusive. As the horizon shifts, illusory shapes and bodies appear and disappear again, lending the compositions the character of a mobile object. This layering of flat glass in conjunction with gestural abstract painting has shifted the painting from defined spatial shapes to the third dimension and makes Ji\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1's works unique even on an international scale.\nIn the decade after 2011, Ji\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 began to work with compositions oriented towards height, where she managed to dynamise and undulate some objects by deviating them from the axis. Objects composed of plate glass offer a range of visual effects - shapes can blend into each other, as well as shift in and out of view, and coloured painted surfaces seen in the foreground are added to those reflected by mirrors. In this way, the artist has created a large number of charismatic works - complex spatial objects composed of flat glass. The layers feature a rich swirl of colour structures, but also monochrome black or red lines combined with flat areas (\"Babylon\", 2012). In the objects created after 2013, she has also resolved the coherence of vertically arranged glasses and created several objects in which austere geometric shapes are applied. \nIn the authenticity of her artistic handwriting, Ji\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 is still one of the most prominent figures of contemporary studio glass in the Czech Republic, and her works have a recognised position in the international context.\nDesign.\nJi\u0159ina \u017dertov\u00e1 is the author of drinking glass, metallurgical glass shaped from free hand and designs of decors of cut lead glass.

As of August 2023 it is partially operational.\nHistory.\nThe power station was originally owned by Adularya Energy, one of the Naksan Holding companies. An environmental impact assessment was done in 2009. Adularya contracted with the builders in 2010 and construction started in 2011. \nFinance and ownership.\nThe power station was financed by the Czech Export Bank,which loaned 433 million euros interest free, with export guarantee from EGAP. After the 2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt Naksan Holding was confiscated for allegedly helping to finance the attempt. The Savings Deposit Insurance Fund made several attempts to reprivatize the power station and eventually sold it to Doruk (part of Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar SSS Holding).\nTechnology.\nAll the lignite is mined locally then washed.

{"id": 72670109, "context": "The Act No. 1 of 2023 on Criminal Code, or the 2023 Indonesian Criminal Code, is the new Indonesian criminal code replacing the Dutch-era code. The law is the most expensive and longest ever made in Indonesia, being more than 50 years in the making since formulation until finally commenced by the Indonesian government.\nThe code, however, will be effectively used on 2 January 2026, 3 years after commencement.\nHistory.\nBefore the law passed, the Dutch-made Criminal Code was used as the Criminal Code for Indonesia. Since 1968, Indonesian lawmakers, law experts, and law researchers had been working on Indonesian-made Criminal Code drafts. Various drafts were made, but never replaced the Code.\nThe Indonesian government has considered changes to the Criminal Code ever since independence, with the colonial-era code being seen as a mismatch with current cultural values. In 2019, a new bill on criminal code was publicly announced, but controversial provisions criminalizing extramarital sex, abortions, and other restrictions on religious and civil liberties led to a series of protests and riots in response, ultimately causing the bill to replace the code to be scrapped. However, in 2022, a bill reintroducing the 2019 proposal with some statutes being \"watered down\" was passed by Indonesia's parliament and is planned to take effect in full after a three-year provisional period, despite similar concerns about its effect on civil rights and the rights of religious and sexual minorities. \nThe new criminal code is finally enacted as Law No. 1/2023 on the Criminal Code. The code is expanded to 624 articles, split into 2 Books: \"General Provisions\" and \"Crime\"; The new code no longer differentiates crime from lesser misdemeanors. It also contains provisions regarding government acknowledgement regarding 'living laws' (\"adat\" or customary rules) in punishing crimes.\nCriticisms.\nThe articles contained several controversial articles:\nCrimes against the personal dignity and honor of the sitting president and vice president.\nArticle 218 verse 1 of the code stated that any person who attack the personal dignity and honor of the sitting president and vice president will be punished by 3 years 6 months imprisonment and category IV (200 million rupiah) fine. Despite that, verse 2 Article 218 guaranteed that such personal attacks may permissible if used for defending oneself or committed for good public interest. Although claimed by the pro-democracy as attack of human rights, the law itself limited that such process of the case report only can be processed if the sitting president or vice president filed themselves in personal capability.\nMagic and black magic.\nArticle 252 of the code regulated magic and black magic. The verse 1 of the article said that anyone who expressed such ability to perform magic, announcing it, giving hope people for it, offering and aiding for such service to cause such immense bodily and mentally harm, diseases, and death will be punished by 1 year 6 months imprisonment and a category IV (200\u00a0million rupiahs) fine. Verse 2 of the article gives additional penalties given by the verse 1 to magic and black magic practitioners who make a living on it. This article is controversial, as it is hard to be proven.\nHoaxing and trolling.\nHoaxing and trolling are already part of culture in Indonesia, either by pro-government or anti-government alike, and enjoyed by the Indonesian population. Troll \"factories\" and so-called \"cyber armies\" had made a living in Indonesia since 2016, making revenue from sowing discord and flooding Internet space with socio-politico-religious misleadings. Article 263 threatened the trolls and hoax makers with 6 years imprisonment. Protesters protested that such regulation threatened what they called as \"democracy\" and called that \"a move to shut the critics\". The Ministry of Law and Human Rights condemned the protesters of the article, assured that their criticism is needed for the country, but feeding lies and misleading people are not. The ministry asked people to read the law carefully and stop consuming irresponsible statements.\nPersonal space invasion by law enforcement.\nArticle 411 to 413 of the code outlawed domestic partner relationship, cohabitation, and incestuous relationship. For pro-privacy advocates, such regulation may translated as personal space invasion by law enforcement, although the law itself stated that such acts only able to be processed if the report filed by the members of the family. With the code, government expected that local law enforcement will not invade privacy due to being codified and there will be no more local regulation granting sweeping power to their local law enforcement. These articles however, inapplicable in Aceh Province, which possessed different law enforcement system granted by the Law No. 11/2006 (On Aceh Province), Wilayatul Hisbah, which is not affected by the code. Law enforcement in Aceh even enjoyed protection under the Article 597 of the code, given its status as customary laws protected by the code.\nResponses.\nAttacks against government institutions.\nOn 7 December 2022, a suicide bombing incident occurred at a police station in Astana Anyar District, Bandung, West Java. The attacker and one police officer were killed by the explosion, while 11 people were injured, including 3 police officers. Police Chief General Listyo Sigit Prabowo said that the perpetrator was affiliated to the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) Bandung branch. \nOpposition to the passing of the Criminal Code Bill into law was the motive of the bombing, as the motorcycle used by the suicide bomber to reach the police station was adorned by pamphlets condeming the Criminal Code. One of the pamphlets brought by the perpetrator read \"KUHP is the law of the mushrik and infidels, declare war to the enforcers of the Devil's Law.\" The same pamphlet also made reference to verse 29 of Surah At-Tawba, which called for the imposition of jizya to non-Muslims.\nForeign condemnation.\nThe passing of the law was condemned by the governments of Australia, United States, South Korea and even the United Nations, largely for not accommodating LGBT and domestic partnership relation protection and rights, as well as not ensuring enough privacy, equity, religious freedom, journalism and sexuality issues. The European Union also condemned the law due to too much regulations on privacy with emphasis on premarital sex, threatening democracy and freedom of speech, and promotion of Western ideologies in Indonesia. The Executive Office of the President of the Republic of Indonesia rejected the claim that the new law contradicts democracy. The deputy minister of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights rejected the international condemnations because the law is considered domestic and should not be compared with Western and international values.", "__index_level_0__": 5406, "length": 1058, "pred": {"ppl": 8.9258813858, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0021263001, "ppl/zlib": 0.0007382648, "Min_5.0% Prob": 9.3364233796, "Min_10.0% Prob": 8.0274371985, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.4771288572, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.4309282072, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.6388741503, "Min_50.0% Prob": 4.0164169545, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.5109665106}, "question": "What controversial provision in the 2023 Indonesian Criminal Code criminalizes magic and black magic?", "answer": "Article 252", "prediction": "Question: What controversial provision in the 2023 Indonesian Criminal Code criminalizes magic and black magic?\nAnswer: Article 252", "generated_answer": " Article 122(1)\nArt. 122 The"}

{"id": 71752194, "context": "Internet GIS, or Internet geographic information systems, is a term that refers to a broad set of technologies and applications that employ the Internet to access, analyze, visualize, and distribute spatial data.\nFundamentals.\nInternet GIS is an outgrowth of traditional geographic information systems or GIS, and represents a paradigm shift from conducting GIS on an individual computer to working with remotely distributed data and functions. Two major issues in GIS are accessing and distributing spatial data and GIS outputs. Internet GIS helps to solve that problem by allowing users to access vast databases impossible to store on a single desktop computer, and by allowing rapid dissemination of both maps and raw data to others. These methods include both file sharing and email. This has enabled the general public to participate in map creation and make use of GIS technology.\nInternet GIS is a subset of Distributed GIS, but specifically uses the internet rather than generic computer networks. Internet GIS applications are often, but not exclusively, conducted through the World Wide Web (also known as the Web), giving rise to the sub-branch of Web GIS, often used interchangeably with Internet GIS. While is has become nearly synonymous with to many in the industry, the two are as distinct as the internet is from the World Wide Web. Likewise, is as distinct from as the Internet is from distributed computer networks in general. \nInternet GIS includes services beyond those enabled by the Web. Use of any other internet-enabled services to facilitate GIS functions, even if used in conjuncture with the Web, represents the use of Internet GIS. One of the most common applications of a distributed GIS system, accessing remotely saved data, can be done through the internet without the need for the Web. This is often done in practice when data are sensitive, such as hospital patient data and research facilities proprietary data, where sending data through the Web may be a security risk. This can be done using a Virtual private network (VPN) to access a local network remotely. The use of VPN for these purposes serged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when employers needed to allow employees using GIS access to sensitive spatial data from home.\nHistory.\nThe history of Internet geographic information systems is linked to the history of the computer, the internet, and the quantitative revolution in geography. Geography tends to adapt technologies from other disciplines rather than innovating and inventing the technologies employed to conduct geographic studies. The computer and internet are not an exception, and were rapidly investigated to purpose towards the needs of geographers. In 1959, Waldo Tobler published the first paper detailing the use of computers in map creation. This was the beginning of computer cartography, or the use of computers to create maps. In 1960, the first true geographic information system capable of storing, analyzing, changing, and creating visualizations with spatial data was created by Roger Tomlinson on behalf of the Canadian Government to manage natural resources. These technologies represented a paradigm shift in cartography and geography, with desktop computer cartography facilitated through GIS rapidly replaced traditional ways of making maps. The emergence of GIS and computer technology contributed to the quantitative revolution in geography and the emergence of the branch of technical geography.\nAs computer technology advanced the desktop machine became the default for producing maps, a process known as digital mapping, or computer cartography. These computers were networked together to share data and processing power and create redundant communications for defense applications. This computer network evolved into the internet, and by the late 1980s, the internet was available in some people's homes. Over time, the internet moved from a novelty to a major part of daily life. Using the internet, it was no longer necessary to store all data for a project locally, and communications were vastly improved. Following this trend, GIScientists began developing methods for combining the internet and GIS. This process accelerated in the 1990s, with the creation of the World Wide Web in 1990 and the first major web mapping program, Xerox PARC Map Viewer, capable of distributed map creation appearing in 1993. This software was unique in that it facilitated dynamic user map generation, rather than static images. These new Web-based programs helped users to employ GIS without having it locally installed on their machine, ultimately leading to Web GIS being the dominant way users interact with internet GIS.\nIn 1995 The US federal government made the TIGER Mapping Service available to the public, facilitating desktop and Web GIS by hosting US boundary data. This data availability, facilitated through the internet, silently revolutionized cartography by providing the world with authoritative boundary files, for free. In 1996, MapQuest became available to the public, facilitating navigation and trip planning. Sometime during the 1990s, more maps were transmitted over the internet than physically printed. This milestone was predicted in 1985 and represented a major shift in how we distribute spatial products to the masses.\nAs of 2020, almost 75% of the population has a smartphones. These devices allow users to access the internet wherever they have service, and have revolutionized how we interact with the internet. One notable example is the rise of \nmobile apps, which have impacted both how GIS is done, and how data are collected. Some mobile apps like the Google Maps mobile app are web-based and allow users to get navigation instructions in real time. Others, like Esri's Survey123 allow users to collect data in the field with their smartphone. As time progresses, internet-based applications that do not make use of HTML or Web Browsers have begun to become to grow in popularity.\nWeb GIS.\nThe World Wide Web is an information system that uses the internet to host, share, and distribute documents, images, and other data. Web GIS involves using the World Wide Web to facilitate GIS tasks traditionally done on a desktop computer, as well as enabling the sharing of maps and spatial data. Most, but not all, internet GIS is Web GIS, however all Web GIS is internet GIS. This is quite similar to how much of the activity on the internet is hosted on the World Wide Web, but not everything on the internet is the World Wide Web. The tasks Web GIS are used for are numerous but can be generally divided into the categories of Geospatial web services: web feature services, web processing services, and web mapping services.\nCriticism.\nBy their definition, maps can never be perfect and are simplifications of reality. Ethical cartographers try to keep these inaccuracies documented and to a minimum, while encouraging critical perspectives when using a map. Internet GIS has brought map-making tools to the general public, facilitating the rapidly disseminating these maps. While this is potentially positive, it also means that people without cartographic training can easily make and disseminate misleading maps to a wide audience. This was brought to public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more then half of all United States state government COVID-19 dashboards had cartographic errors. Further, malicious actors can quickly spread intentionally misleading spatial information while hiding the source.\nFor many users, the World Wide Web is synonymous with the Internet, which is true for Internet GIS. Most functions done with Internet GIS are conducted through the use of Web GIS. This has caused the borders between the two terms to blur, and \"Web GIS\" to become genericized into meaning any GIS done over the internet to some users.", "__index_level_0__": 1151, "length": 1228, "pred": {"ppl": 7.9263725281, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0076568368, "ppl/zlib": 0.0006563714, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.6397879124, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.4235385145, "Min_20.0% Prob": 6.0057103797, "Min_30.0% Prob": 5.0405058375, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.3330250549, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.7796676258, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.3193343708}, "question": "What is the main purpose of Internet GIS?", "answer": "To access, analyze, visualize, and distribute spatial data using the internet.", "prediction": "Question: What is the main purpose of Internet GIS?\nAnswer: To access, analyze, visualize, and distribute spatial data using the internet.", "generated_answer": " to allow the rapid dissemination of geospatial information"}

ISRO already launched IRNSS 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 1G, 1H and 1I. The satellite is intended to replace IRNSS-1G and augment the constellation of geosynchronous navigation satellites after IRNSS-1I.\nPayload.\nNVS-01 has two types of payloads, navigation payload and the ranging payload. The navigation payload transmits navigation service signals to the users. This payload is operating in L1 band, L5 band and S band. A highly stable Rubidium atomic clock is part of the navigation payload of the satellite. Failure of the imported Rubidium atomic clocks across the fleet of previous generation of satellite led to the creation of an indigenous option. NVS-01 is the first navigation satellite to host the indigenous clock.\nThe ranging payload consists of transponder which is operated in CDMA mode for two-way range measurements. The IRNSS satellites continuously emits time stamped navigation signals, which are received by the ground-based user receivers. The information is then processed by the receivers to derive their own position, velocity and time. The system provides seamless, uninterrupted services under all weather conditions.\nThe new generation of navigation satellite features a new and improved encryption system for bolstering the communication of the satellite specially for the restricted users.\nSatellite.\nThe satellite will help in maintaining the continuity that was lagging due to the failure of Rubidium Atomic clocks in previous satellites whilst bolstering the feature set with new bands and longer life. The NavIC space segment consists of seven satellites. With the new series of satellites, ISRO aims to tap into the low power satellite navigation segment like Smart Watches and fitness trackers whilst cementing its Navigation system by allowing it to seamlessly integrate and interoperate with the existing Navigation system.

It was recorded on October 30 and 31, 1991, in Berlin, and was released in 1994 by FMP.\nIn his liner notes, Steve Lake wrote: \"Peter has been muttering for years about his image as The Loudest, The Heaviest Free Jazz Player Of Them All hanging over him like a curse - without, it must be said, doing much to rectify the picture. Fred Hopkins and Rashied Ali, employing subtle persuasion of their own, guide him to other areas. Though this set will probably be assessed as a saxophone trio album, it really is the bassist and the drummer who establish the direction, and Br\u00f6tzmann follows as best he can.\"\nReception.\nIn a review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek called the album \"the most understated performance of [Br\u00f6tzmann's] entire career,\" and wrote: \"Br\u00f6tzmann appears to have been in awe on this date so great is his restraint. There are literally no passages in the entire concert where he attempts to push his way through the rhythm section to get to the other side... it comes off as a very intense, extremely quiet kind of blowing gig, where this trio were looking to discover things about each other and the music they were making... a landmark in Br\u00f6tzmann's career.\"\nThe authors of \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\" described the album as \"a 'traditional' free trio, the American team playing with flair and swing, which Br\u00f6tzmann uses for shape and context with his own severe lyricism.\"\nMark Corroto of \"All About Jazz\" commented: \"\"Songlines\" is a fantastic introduction to those new to the music of Peter Brotzmann. It is the free jazz equivalent of Coltrane's \"Ballads\"... recording. It acts as an easing into the heavy ideology the German created in the late 1960s.\"\n\"The Free Jazz Collective\"'s Colin Green remarked: \"One senses both Br\u00f6tzmann and Ali reining themselves in to acclimatise Hopkins, who's very much centre-stage, physically and musically...

The book is profusely illustrated with characteristic Japanese pictures by Kei-Sai Yei-Sen of Yedo or Tokio. \nSynopsis.\n\"The Loyal Ronins\" relates to affairs that occurred in 1698. Lord Morningfield, Daimio of Ako, is condemned to commit hara-kiri (through the treachery and deceit of Sir Kara, master of ceremonies to the Shogun), and his property is confiscated. His widow, Lady Fair-Face, assumes the religious name of Pure-Gem and lives in retirement. Forty-seven of his retainers \u2014 now Ronins, or outlaws of the Samurai class \u2014 sign with their blood an agreement to avenge his death. Under the leadership of Sir Big-Rock, who divorces his wife and disowns his children, that they may not be punished for his deeds, the Ronins slay Sir Kira in his own house. After imposing ceremonies of respect at the tomb of their illustrious chief, the Ronins surrender themselves to the Council at Yedo. They are condemned to death and sentenced to commit hara-kiri. Forty-six forms clothed in pure white, headed by Sir Big-Rock, mount the hill of death, plunge into the dark river, and pass over to Paradise, where they are welcomed by the spirit of their beloved chief.\nDevelopment.\nThe translation was done by Greey, an English-American with long experience in Japan, with the assistance of Shiuichiro Saito, a young Japanese, then practising Law in Boston. The book made about 300 pages, and contained the thirty full-plate illustrations by Kei-Sai Yei-Sen, of Yedo, which were printed with the Japanese edition of \"Iroha bunko\". The cover was designed and drawn by Greey after a Japanese design.\nAppraisal.\nHelen Rex Keller writes, \"The main story is very simple, though there are numerous episodes touching or humorous. \u2026 The graceful poetic style gives great charm to this na\u00efve romance, the names of the characters are quaint even in translation, and the pictures of feudal Japan are vivid and fascinating.

{"id": 72054314, "context": "The Nearchi were an ancient tribe dwelling in lower Provence.\nName.\nThey are mentioned as \"Nearchi\" by Rufus Festus Avienus (4th c. CE).\nThe ethnonym can be compared with the Ancient Greek personal name \"N\u00e9arkhos\" (\u039d\u03ad\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2; Latin \"Nearchus\"). It may have originally referred to a local settlement founded in southern Gaul by a Greek explorer bearing this name, then applied to the nearby tribe.\nHistory.\nHistorian Guy Barruol argues that the great age of the sources used by Avienus could make the Nearchi one of the earliest documented tribes of lower Provence along with the Salyes. According to scholar Michael Dietler, however, even though Avienus' \"Ora Maritima\", which was composed in the fourth century CE, \"is thought to have been derived from a \"periplus\" written by a Massalian sailor of the sixth or fourth century BCE\", it \"can hardly be used as evidence of the earlier presence of this name\" since the text contains \"many anachronisms and errors\".\nGeography.\nFrom what can be inferred from Avienus' account, the Nearchi dwelled in lower Provence, near the Salyes and the Rh\u00f4ne river.

{"id": 73798084, "context": "The Codex Dimonie is a collection of Aromanian-language biblical and religious texts translated from Greek. It represents the most comprehensive collection of early Aromanian texts known to date, comprising 127 loose sheets, which were probably bound in the past. The Codex Dimonie was discovered by Gustav Weigand, who subsequently published it, in 1889 in the house of the brothers Iancu and Mihail Dimonie in Ohrid (), then in the Ottoman Empire and now in North Macedonia.\nThe Codex Dimonie has been dated as being from the end of the 18th century or the beginning of the 19th century. Its exact year of writing is unknown. It is also unknown who made the translations, although it is assumed that it was more than one person. The Codex Dimonie includes the Acts of the Apostles, the Gospel of Mark and the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom. They are translations taken from Greek-language authors such as Damaskinos Stouditis and Ephrem the Syrian. These translations present several features of the Moscopolean dialect of Aromanian. The variety of spellings that are used are indicative that the language lacked literary tradition at the time.\nThe Codex Dimonie is one of the earliest Aromanian-language works along with the also anonymous Aromanian Missal and the publications of Theodore Kavalliotis, Daniel Moscopolites and Constantin Ucuta. The texts that make up the Codex Dimonie are notably heterogeneous, indicating that they may have been written by several different authors. The place of origin of the Codex Dimonie is unknown, but the translators of the texts that wrote it were probably from Moscopole, once a prosperous Aromanian city now in Albania. The main author is presumed to have been the great-uncle of the Dimonie brothers with whom Weigand found the manuscripts; he might have been an Aromanian from Moscopole, or possibly descended from an Albanian-speaking family from the city.\nThe authors of the manuscripts were fluent in Greek (albeit with poor grasp on the language's orthography), Turkish and Albanian. The manuscripts are entirely written in Aromanian using the Greek alphabet. As this alphabet does not have graphemes to represent several Aromanian sounds, there is a defective and inconsistent rendering of these sounds through diacritics and the combination of graphemes.\nThe intentions of the authors of the Codex Dimonie are unknown. Considering that the manuscripts were not structured in the form of teaching material, they likely did not intend to establish a writing system for Aromanian or spread its use as a church language. The goal of the authors would rather have been more modest, limited to the translation and dissemination of religious texts, especially sermons, the lives of saints and knowledge on Aromanian religious practices.", "__index_level_0__": 10624, "length": 439, "pred": {"ppl": 7.1182608604, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.0196582429, "ppl/zlib": 0.0015466221, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.9900820851, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.5819897285, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.9790116787, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.9513983531, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.2013572262, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.6222695175, "Min_60.0% Prob": 3.1655384502}, "question": "What is the main content of the Codex Dimonie?", "answer": "A collection of Aromanian-language biblical and religious texts translated from Greek.", "prediction": "Question: What is the main content of the Codex Dimonie?\nAnswer: A collection of Aromanian-language biblical and religious texts translated from Greek.", "generated_answer": " The codex Dimonie is a collection of"}

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\nDescription and history.\nThe original portion is an I-house built of brick laid in Flemish bond, built upon a stone and coursed rubble foundation. Its original builder and owner are unknown; in 1882 it was owned by Ann Swindler. Its nine-panel front door is flanked by four-pane sidelights. An ell addition, built sometime in 1925-1949 period, has an enclosed porch on its north side. The interior includes chair rails and Federal-style moldings, as well as Federal mantels having central tablets with sunbursts and reeded pilasters on fireplaces in the north and south rooms. The kitchen, in the east room of the ell, in 1986, was deemed modern.\nThe house was deemed significant for NRHP listing as \"a well-preserved example of an early 19th century (1810-40) brick I-house in Shelby County.\" It was one of 12 two-story, brick, center-passage, single-pile plan houses of its era that were identified in a study of historic resources in the county. This one differed \"from the others in that it is four bays rather than three or five bays in width. It also contains an enclosed corner stair in the south room which opens into that room. This is the only such example noted in the county. The removal of the wing to the south has not compromised the significant form of the structure, nor have other alterations.\"\nThe house was built with orientation to the west, as shown in 1981 photos, with a front door having nine panels and 4-pane sidelights. It seems miss-oriented now, as the lane approaching the house comes from the east, while there is no apparent road connection to the west. Photos from 1986 or before in the documentation show a backyard type appurtenance, a large propane tank, set behind to the west, out from the \"front\" door. Viewed from above, it seems clear that the public road coming NNE from Shelbyville towards the house (identified as Washburn Road in Google maps) once continued straight and came right by the house, which was set back appropriately, facing it. That road now takes a right turn to the east about before reaching the house (and then to reach the house, a visitor from Shelbyville would go east about 1200\u00a0ft, then turn left (north) on Mulberry Pike, proceed about 1000\u00a0ft, then turn left (west) on the lane which runs about 1000\u00a0ft to the house and farm complex).\nThe NRHP-listed area is just out of large property.

{"id": 71895223, "context": "Buoy is the official mascot for the Seattle Kraken, a National Hockey League (NHL) team based in Seattle.\nHistory.\nThe process of finding a mascot took two years, starting around the time the team unveiled their name in July 2020. Because a kraken is a mythical being whose complete appearance is unknown, the team chose not to use it as a mascot. The team also opted not to have an octopus mascot, to avoid redundancy with Al the Octopus, mascot of the Detroit Red Wings.\nIn December 2021, the Kraken announced a non-fungible token (NFT) sale; 32 tokens allowed their owners to see \"mysterious hints of the Kraken mascot\", with the expectation that the NFT would show the complete mascot upon the official announcement. Critics said that the promotion conflicted with the team's sustainability goals, due to the high energy costs associated with NFTs.\nDuring the 2021\u201322 season, in the absence of an official mascot, the Kraken promoted a \"team dog\" named Davy Jones. The dog, a four-month-old husky mix rescue dog introduced on January 17, 2022, socialized with fans at home games as he trained to be a therapy dog.\nThe Kraken introduced Buoy on October 1, 2022, prior to a preseason game at Climate Pledge Arena against the Vancouver Canucks. The Kraken had intended to introduce Buoy around Christmas during the 2021\u201322 season, but due to game postponements related to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, the team decided to wait until prior to the 2022\u201323 season instead.\nDescription.\nBuoy, said to be a nephew of the Fremont Troll, is a tall blue sea troll. His hair is \"a nod to hockey flow and the waves of Puget Sound,\" said Lamont Buford, the Kraken's vice president of entertainment experience and production. He has a removable front tooth, a squeaky aqua-blue nose, an anchor earring representing the Kraken's alternate logo, freckles, and a \"mysterious tentacle indicating an encounter with the Kraken.\" He makes regular appearances at Kraken home games with Red Alert, the team's marching band, and navigates around the arena's concourses using elevators and a motorized hoverboard.\nThe mascot maintains an active presence on Twitter; after some Twitter users responded sarcastically or negatively to his introduction, Buoy trolled these users with dismissive or sarcastic responses of his own. Gritty, the Philadelphia Flyers mascot, and Chance, the Vegas Golden Knights mascot, tweeted messages of solidarity with Buoy upon his debut.\nReaction to Buoy's debut was polarized, with many observers expressing a strong like or dislike for the mascot. A reporter for KUOW called negative attention to the criticism of Buoy by adults, noting that the mascot is targeted at children. On his \"Spittin' Chiclets\" podcast, Paul Bissonnette called Buoy \"the ugliest mascot of all time\". Halfway through the 2022\u201323 NHL season, ESPN's Greg Wyshynski called Buoy the worst Seattle Kraken development of the season so far, describing the mascot as \"a land-based troll doll with Brian Burke's hairstyle.\" In late December 2022, however, two \"The Seattle Times\" reporters wrote that Buoy \"appears to be a hit\" with younger Kraken fans.", "__index_level_0__": 1834, "length": 503, "pred": {"ppl": 6.0981669426, "ppl/lowercase_ppl": -1.032481619, "ppl/zlib": 0.0011299926, "Min_5.0% Prob": 8.8341590791, "Min_10.0% Prob": 7.5177199308, "Min_20.0% Prob": 5.9712120701, "Min_30.0% Prob": 4.9004510038, "Min_40.0% Prob": 4.1045822459, "Min_50.0% Prob": 3.4829180141, "Min_60.0% Prob": 2.9837969556}, "question": "What is the name of the official mascot for the Seattle Kraken?", "answer": "Buoy", "prediction": "Question: What is the name of the official mascot for the Seattle Kraken?\nAnswer: Buoy", "generated_answer": " Brute\n\nQ: When is Alibaba"}

In February 1568, James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, the half-brother of Mary, Queen of Scots, and ruler of Scotland as Regent, ordered clothes for Nagier. This was shortly after Moray's return from England, where he had presented papers incriminating his sister at York and Westminster. The tailor John Murdoch made cloaks called \"mandells\" and breiks from yellow stemming cloth for four lackeys and for the \"moir\", meaning Nageir. The cloak had velvet at the neck.\nSimilarly, in 1590, Anne of Denmark ordered clothes for her unnamed African servant and pages, and he ate with her lackeys, servants connected with riding and the stable. Nagier, dressed in costume like the other lackeys, was a riding companion for Moray and his wife Agnes Keith. In December 1569, John Murdoch made a coat and hose for \"Nageir the More\" from fine violet stemming, with a canvas doublet and a hat.\nNageir may have previously worked for Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1568 and 1569 Regent Moray bought clothes for some of her former servants, including James Geddie and Nichola her entertainers or fools. His name does not appear among those of 12 of her pages and lackeys in March 1567. Possibly, Nagier arrived in Scotland with Moray on 9 August 1567, when he returned from France. In Dieppe, waiting for his ship and a favourable wind, Moray lodged with William Aikman \"alias\" Guillaume Acquemen, a prominent Scottish merchant. Aikman came to Scotland with Moray, returning to Dieppe in October 1567 with Moray's passport and the Laird of Haltoun. At this time there were African people in Dieppe, brought by Spanish ships. One man, known as \"Poix blanc\", an expert swordsman involved in a Huguenot rebellion, was hanged by the Catholic authorities.\nNagier was employed at the Scottish court until Regent Moray was assassinated while riding through Linlithgow on 23 January 1570. An account of the expenses of Moray's funeral and burial includes further details about Nageir. From the 27 January to 26 April 1570, he and another former servant, Pier Antweyne, were lodged in John McCullough's house in Edinburgh. Nageir was bought a cloak-coat and \"gargasis\" of French russet, and another canvas doublet. With new hats and three new pairs of shoes, Nageir and Pier took ship from Leith to Dieppe.
